those fallen May their souls be commended to Malek A dragon without its rider is a tragedy A rider without their dragon is dead Article One Section OneThe Dragon Riders Codex CHAPTER ONE Conscription Day is always the deadliest Maybe thats why the sunrise is especially beautiful this morningbecause I know it might be my last I tighten the straps of my heavy canvas rucksack and trudge up the wide staircase of the stone fortress I call home My chest heaves with exertion my lungs burning by the time I reach the stone corridor leading to General Sorrengails office This is what six months of intense physical training has given methe ability to barely climb six flights of stairs with a thirtypound pack Im so fucked The thousands of twentyyearolds waiting outside the gate to enter their chosen quadrant for service are the smartest and strongest in Navarre Hundreds of them have been preparing for the Riders Quadrant the chance to become one of the elite since birth Ive had exactly six months The expressionless guards lining the wide hallway at the top of the landing avoid my eyes as I pass but thats nothing new Besides being ignored is the best possible scenario for me Basgiath War College isnt known for being kind towell anyone even those of us whose mothers are in command Every Navarrian officer whether they choose to be schooled as healers scribes infantry or riders is molded within these cruel walls over three years honed into weapons to secure our mountainous borders from the violent invasion attempts of the kingdom of Poromiel and their gryphon riders The weak dont survive here especially not in the Riders Quadrant The dragons make sure of that Youre sending her to die a familiar voice thunders through the generals thick wooden door and I gasp Theres only one woman on the Continent foolish enough to raise her voice to the general but shes supposed to be on the border with the Eastern Wing Mira Theres a muffled response from the office and I reach for the door handle She doesnt stand a chance Mira shouts as I force the heavy door open and the weight of my pack shifts forward nearly taking me down Shit The general curses from behind her desk and I grab onto the back of the crimsonupholstered couch to catch my balance Damn it Mom she cant even handle her rucksack Mira snaps rushing to my side Im fine My cheeks heat with mortification and I force myself upright Shes been back for five minutes and is already trying to save me Because you need saving you fool I dont want this I dont want any part of this Riders Quadrant shit Its not like I have a death wish I would have been better off failing the admission test to Basgiath and going straight to the army with the majority of conscripts But I can handle my rucksack and I will handle myself Oh Violet Worried brown eyes look down at me as strong hands brace my shoulders Hi Mira A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth She might be here to say her goodbyes but Im just glad to see my sister for the first time in years Her eyes soften and her fingers flex on my shoulders like she might pull me into a hug but she steps back and turns to stand at my side facing our mother You cant do this Its already done Mom shrugs the lines of her fitted black uniform rising and falling with the motion I scoff So much for the hope of a reprieve Not that I ever should have expected or even hoped for an ounce of mercy from a woman whos been made famous for her lack of it Then undo it Mira seethes Shes spent her whole life training to become a scribe She wasnt raised to be a rider Well she certainly isnt you is she Lieutenant Sorrengail Mom braces her hands on the immaculate surface of her desk and leans in slightly as she stands looking us over with narrowed appraising eyes that mirror the dragons carved into the furnitures massive legs I dont need the prohibited power of mind reading to know exactly what she sees At twentysix years old Miras a younger version of our mother Shes tall with strong powerful muscles toned from years of sparring and hundreds of hours spent on the back of her dragon Her skin practically glows with health and her goldenbrown hair is sheared short for combat in the same style as Moms But more than looks she carries the same arrogance the unwavering conviction that she belongs in the sky Shes a rider through and through Shes everything Im not and the disapproving shake of Moms head says she agrees Im too short Too frail What curves I do have should be muscle and my traitorous body makes me embarrassingly vulnerable Mom walks toward us her polished black boots gleaming in the mage lights that flicker from the sconces She picks up the end of my long braid scoffs at the section just above my shoulders where the brown strands start to lose their warmth of color and slowly fade to a steely metallic silver by the ends and then drops it Pale skin pale eyes pale hair Her gaze siphons every ounce of my confidence down to the marrow in my bones Its like that fever stole all your coloring along with your strength Grief flashes through her eyes and her brows furrow I told him not to keep you in that library Its not the first time Ive heard her curse the sickness that nearly killed her while she was pregnant with me or the library Dad made my second home once shed been stationed here at Basgiath as an instructor and he as a scribe I love that library I counter Its been more than a year since his heart finally failed and the Archives are still the only place that feels like home in this giant fortress the only place where I still feel my fathers presence Spoken like the daughter of a scribe Mom says quietly and I see itthe woman she was while Dad was alive Softer Kinderat least for her family I am the daughter of a scribe My back screams at me so I let my pack slip from my shoulders guiding it to the floor and take my first full breath since leaving my room Mom blinks and that softer woman is gone leaving only the general Youre the daughter of a rider you are twenty years old and today is Conscription Day I let you finish your tutoring but like I told you last spring I will not watch one of my children enter the Scribe Quadrant Violet Because scribes are so far beneath riders I grumble knowing perfectly well that riders are the top of the social and military hierarchy It helps that their bonded dragons roast people for fun Yes Her customary composure slips And if you dare walk into the tunnel toward the Scribe Quadrant today I will rip you out by that ridiculous braid and put you on the parapet myself My stomach turns over Dad wouldnt want this Mira argues color flushing up her neck I loved your father but hes dead Mom says as if giving the weather report I doubt he wants much these days I suck in a breath but keep my mouth shut Arguing will get me nowhere Shes never listened to a damned thing Ive had to say before and today is no different Sending Violet into the Riders Quadrant is tantamount to a death sentence Guess Mira isnt done arguing Miras never done arguing with Mom and the frustrating thing about it is that Mom has always respected her for it Double standard for the win Shes not strong enough Mom Shes already broken her arm this year she sprains some joint every other week and shes not tall enough to mount any dragon big enough to keep her alive in a battle Seriously Mira What The Hell My fingernails bite into my palms as I curl my hands into fists Knowing my chances of survival are minimal is one thing Having my sister throw my inadequacies in my face is another Are you calling me weak No Mira squeezes my hand Justfragile Thats not any better Dragons dont bond fragile women They incinerate them So shes small Mom scans me up and down taking in the generous fit of the cream belted tunic and pants I selected this morning for my potential execution I snort Are we just listing my faults now I never said it was a fault Mom turns to my sister Mira Violet deals with more pain before lunch than you do in an entire week If any of my children is capable of surviving the Riders Quadrant its her My eyebrows rise That sounded an awful lot like a compliment but with Mom Im never quite sure How many rider candidates die on Conscription Day Mom Forty Fifty Are you that eager to bury another child Mira seethes I cringe as the temperature in the room plummets courtesy of Moms stormwielding signet power she channels through her dragon Aimsir My chest tightens at the memory of my brother No one has dared to mention Brennan or his dragon in the five years since they died fighting the Tyrrish rebellion in the south Mom tolerates me and respects Mira but she loved Brennan Dad did too His chest pains started right after Brennans death Moms jaw tightens and her eyes threaten retribution as she glares at Mira My sister swallows but holds her own in the staring competition Mom I start She didnt mean Get Out Lieutenant Moms words are soft puffs of steam in the frigid office Before I report you absent from your unit without leave Mira straightens her posture nods once and pivots with military precision then strides for the door without another word grabbing a small rucksack on the way out Its the first time Mom and I have been alone in months Her eyes meet mine and the temperature rises as she takes a deep breath You scored in the top quarter for speed and agility during the entrance exam Youll do just fine All Sorrengails do just fine She skims the backs of her fingers down my cheek barely grazing my skin So much like your father she whispers before clearing her throat and backing up a few steps Guess there are no meritorious service awards for emotional availability I wont be able to acknowledge you for the next three years she says sitting back on the edge of her desk Since as commanding general of Basgiath Ill be your far superior officer I know Its the least of my concerns considering she barely acknowledges me now You wont get any special treatment just because youre my daughter either If anything theyll come after you harder to make you prove yourself She arches an eyebrow Well aware Good thing Ive been training with Major Gillstead for the last several months since Mom made her decree She sighs and forces a smile Then I guess Ill see you in the valley at Threshing candidate Though youll be a cadet by sunset I suppose Or dead Neither of us says it Good luck Candidate Sorrengail She moves back behind her desk effectively dismissing me Thank you General I heft my pack onto my shoulders and walk out of her office A guard closes the door behind me Shes batshit crazy Mira says from the center of the hallway right between where two guards are positioned Theyll tell her you said that Like they dont already know she grinds out through clenched teeth Lets go We only have an hour before all candidates have to report and I saw thousands waiting outside the gates when I flew over She starts walking leading me down the stone staircase and through the hallways to my room Wellit was my room In the thirty minutes Ive been gone all my personal items have been packed into crates that now sit stacked in the corner My stomach sinks to the hardwood floor She had my entire life boxed Shes fucking efficient Ill give you that Mira mutters before turning my way her gaze passing over me in open assessment I was hoping Id be able to talk her out of it You were never meant for the Riders Quadrant So youve mentioned I lift an eyebrow at her Repeatedly Sorry She winces dropping to the ground and emptying her pack What are you doing What Brennan did for me she says softly and grief lodges in my throat Can you use a sword I shake my head Too heavy Im pretty quick with daggers though Really damned quick Lightning quick What I lack in strength I make up for in speed I figured Good Now drop your pack and take off those horrible boots She sorts through the items shes brought handing me new boots and a black uniform Put these on Whats wrong with my pack I ask but drop my rucksack anyway She immediately opens it ripping out everything Id carefully packed Mira That took me all night Youre carrying way too much and your boots are a death trap Youll slip right off the parapet with those smooth soles I had a set of rubberbottomed rider boots made for you just in case and this my dear Violet is the worst case Books start flying landing in the vicinity of the crate Hey I can only take what I can carry and I want those I lunge for the next book before she has a chance to toss it barely managing to save my favorite collection of dark fables Are you willing to die for it she asks her eyes turning hard I can carry it This is all wrong Im supposed to be dedicating my life to books not throwing them in the corner to lighten my rucksack No You cant Youre barely thrice the weight of the pack the parapet is roughly eighteen inches wide two hundred feet aboveground and last time I looked those were rain clouds moving in Theyre not going to give you a rain delay just because the bridge might get a little slick sis Youll fall Youll die Now are you going to listen to me Or are you going to join the other dead candidates at tomorrow mornings roll call Theres no trace of my older sister in the rider before me This woman is shrewd cunning and a touch cruel This is the woman who survived all three years with only one scar the one her own dragon gave her during Threshing Because thats all youll be Another tombstone Another name scorched in stone Ditch the books Dad gave this one to me I murmur pressing the book against my chest Maybe its childish just a collection of stories that warn us against the lure of magic and even demonize dragons but its all I have left She sighs Is it that old book of folklore about darkwielding vermin and their wyvern Havent you read it a thousand times already Probably more I admit And theyre venin not vermin Dad and his allegories she says Just dont try to channel power without being a bonded rider and redeyed monsters wont hide under your bed waiting to snatch you away on their twolegged dragons to join their dark army She retrieves the last book I packed from the rucksack and hands it to me Ditch the books Dad cant save you He tried I tried Decide Violet Are you going to die a scribe Or live as a rider I glance down at the books in my arms and make my choice Youre a pain in the ass I put the fables in the corner but keep the other tome in my hands as I face my sister A pain in the ass who is going to keep you alive Whats that one for she challenges Killing people I hand it back to her A slow smile spreads across her face Good You can keep that one Now get changed while I sort out the rest of this mess The bell rings high above us We have fortyfive minutes I dress quickly but everything feels like it belongs to someone else though its obviously tailored to my size My tunic is replaced by a tightfitting black shirt that covers my arms and my breezy pants are exchanged for leather ones that hug every curve Then she laces me into a veststyle corset over the shirt Keeps it from rubbing she explains Like the gear riders wear into battle Have to admit the clothes are pretty badass even if I feel like an imposter Gods this is really happening Exactly because thats what youre doing Going into battle The combination of leather and a fabric I dont recognize covers me from collarbone to just below my waist wrapping over my breasts and crossing up and over my shoulders I finger the hidden sheaths sewn diagonally along the rib cage For your daggers I only have four I grab them from the pile on the floor Youll earn more I slide my weapons into the sheaths as though my ribs themselves have become weapons The design is ingenious Between my ribs and the sheaths at my thighs the blades are easily accessible I barely recognize myself in the mirror I look like a rider I still feel like a scribe Minutes later half of what I packed is piled onto the crates Shes repacked my rucksack discarding anything deemed unnecessary and almost everything sentimental while wordvomiting advice about how to survive in the quadrant Then she surprises me by doing the most sentimental thing evertelling me to sit between her knees so she can braid my hair into a crown Its like Im a kid again instead of a fullgrown woman but I do it What is this I test the material just above my heart scratching it with my fingernail Something I designed she explains tugging my braid painfully tight against my scalp I had it specially made for you with Teines scales sewn in so be careful with it Dragon scales I jerk my head back to look at her How Teine is huge I happen to know a rider whose powers can make big things very small A devious smile plays across her lips And smaller thingsmuch much bigger I roll my eyes Miras always been more vocal about her men than I have beenabout all two of them I mean how much bigger She laughs then tugs on my braid Head forward You should have cut your hair She pulls the strands tight against my head and resumes weaving Its a liability in sparring and in battle not to mention being a giant target No one else has hair that fades out to silver like this and theyll already be aiming for you You know very well the natural pigment seems to gradually abandon it no matter the length My eyes are just as indecisive a light hazel of varying blues and ambers that never seems to favor either actual color Besides other than everyone elses concern for the shade my hair is the only thing about me thats perfectly healthy Cutting it would feel like Im punishing my body for finally doing something well and its not like I feel the need to hide who I am Youre not Mira yanks on my braid pulling my head back and our eyes lock Youre the smartest woman I know Dont forget that Your brain is your best weapon Outsmart them Violet Do you hear me I nod and she loosens her grip then finishes the braid and pulls me to my feet as she continues to summarize years of knowledge into fifteen harried minutes barely pausing to breathe Be observant Quiet is fine but make sure you notice everything and everyone around you to your advantage Youve read the Codex A few times The rule book for the Riders Quadrant is a fraction of the length of the other divisions Probably because riders have trouble obeying rules Good Then you know that the other riders can kill you at any time and the cutthroat cadets will try Fewer cadets means better odds at Threshing There are never enough dragons willing to bond and anyone reckless enough to get themselves killed isnt worthy of a dragon anyway Except when sleeping Its an executable offense to attack any cadet while sleeping Article Three Yes but that doesnt mean youre safe at night Sleep in this if you can She taps the stomach of my corset Rider black is supposed to be earned You sure I shouldnt wear my tunic today I skim my hands over the leather The wind up on the parapet will catch any spare cloth like a sail She hands me my nowmuchlighter pack The tighter your clothes the better off you are up there and in the ring once you start sparring Wear the armor at all times Keep your daggers on you at all times She points to the sheaths down her thighs Someones going to say I didnt earn them Youre a Sorrengail she responds as if thats answer enough Fuck what they say And you dont think the dragon scales are cheating Theres no such thing as cheating once you climb the turret Theres only survival and death The bell chimesonly thirty minutes left She swallows Its almost time Ready No Neither was I A wry smile lifts a corner of her mouth And Id spent my life training for it Im not going to die today I sling my pack over my shoulders and breathe a little easier than this morning Its infinitely more manageable The halls of the central administrative part of the fortress are eerily quiet as we wind our way down through various staircases but the noise from outside grows louder the lower we descend Through the windows I see thousands of candidates hugging their loved ones and saying their goodbyes on the grassy fields just beneath the main gate From what Ive witnessed every year most families hold on to their candidates right up to the very last bell The four roads leading to the fortress are clogged with horses and wagons especially where they converge in front of the college but its the empty ones at the edge of the fields that make me nauseous Theyre for the bodies Right before we round the last corner that will lead to the courtyard Mira stops What is Oof She yanks me against her chest hugging me tight in the relative privacy of the corridor I love you Violet Remember everything Ive told you Dont become another name on the death roll Her voice shakes and I wrap my arms around her squeezing tight Ill be all right I promise She nods her chin bumping against the top of my head I know Lets go Thats all she says before pulling away and walking into the crowded courtyard just inside the main gate to the fortress Instructors commanders and even our mother are gathered informally waiting for the madness outside the walls to become the order within Out of all the doors in the war college the main gate is the only one no cadet will enter today since each quadrant has its own entrance and facilities Hell the riders have their own citadel Pretentious egotistical fucks I follow Mira catching her with a few quick strides Find Dain Aetos Mira tells me as we cross through the courtyard heading for the open gate Dain I cant help but smile at the thought of seeing Dain again and my heart rate jumps Its been a year and Ive missed his soft brown eyes and the way he laughs the way every part of his body joins in Ive missed our friendship and the moments I thought it might turn into more under the right circumstances Ive missed the way he looks at me like Im someone worth noticing Ive just missedhim Ive only been out of the quadrant for three years but from what I hear hes doing well and hell keep you safe Dont smile like that Mira chides Hell be a secondyear She shakes her finger at me Dont mess around with secondyears If you want to get laid and you shouldshe lifts her browsoften considering you never know what the day brings then screw around in your own year Nothing is worse than cadets gossiping that youve slept your way to safety So Im free to take any of the firstyears I want to bed I say with a little grin Just not the second or thirdyears Exactly She winks We cross through the gates leaving the fortress and join the organized chaos beyond Each of Navarres six provinces has sent this years share of candidates for military service Some volunteer Some are sentenced as punishment Most are conscripted The only thing we have in common here at Basgiath is that we passed the entrance examboth written and an agility test I still can not believe I passedwhich means at least we wont end up as fodder for the infantry on the front line The atmosphere is tense with anticipation as Mira leads me along the worn cobblestone path toward the southern turret The main college is built into the side of Basgiath Mountain as if it was cleaved from a ridgeline of the peak itself The sprawling formidable structure towers over the crowd of anxious waiting candidates and their tearful families with its storiestall stone battlementsbuilt to protect the high rise of the keep withinand defensive turrets at each of its corners one of which houses the bells The majority of the crowd moves to line up at the base of the northern turretthe entrance to the Infantry Quadrant Some of the mass heads toward the gate behind usthe Healer Quadrant that consumes the southern end of the college Envy clenches my chest when I spot a few taking the central tunnel into the archives below the fortress to join the Scribe Quadrant The entrance to the Riders Quadrant is nothing more than a fortified door at the base of the tower just like the infantry entrance to the north But while the infantry candidates can walk straight into their groundlevel quadrant we rider candidates will climb Mira and I join the riders line waiting to sign in and I make the mistake of glancing up High above us crossing the riverbottomed valley that divides the main college from the even higher looming citadel of the Riders Quadrant on the southern ridgeline is the parapet the stone bridge thats about to separate rider candidates from the cadets over the next few hours I cant believe Im about to cross that thing And to think Ive been preparing for the scribes written exam all these years My voice drips with sarcasm I should have been playing on a balance beam Mira ignores me as the line moves forward and candidates disappear through the door Dont let the wind sway your steps Two candidates ahead of us a woman sobs as her partner rips her away from a young man the couple breaking from the line retreating in tears down the hillside toward the crowd of loved ones lining the roads There are no other parents ahead of us only a few dozen candidates moving toward the rollkeepers Keep your eyes on the stones ahead of you and dont look down Mira says the lines of her face tightening Arms out for balance If the pack slips drop it Better it falls than you I look behind us where it seems hundreds have filed in within the span of minutes Maybe I should let them go first I whisper as panic fists my heart What the hell am I doing No Mira answers The longer you wait on those stepsshe motions toward the towerthe greater your fear has a chance to grow Cross the parapet before the terror owns you The line moves and the bell chimes again Its eight oclock Sure enough the crowd of thousands behind us has separated fully into their chosen quadrants all lined up to sign the roll and begin their service Focus Mira snaps and I whip my head forward This might sound harsh but dont seek friendships in there Violet Forge alliances There are only two ahead of us nowa woman with a full pack whose high cheekbones and oval face remind me of renderings of Amari the queen of the gods Her dark brown hair is worn in several rows of short braids that just touch the equally dark skin of her neck The second is the muscular blond man with the woman crying over him Hes carrying an even bigger rucksack I look around the pair toward the rollkeeping desk and my eyes widen Is he I whisper Mira glances and mutters a curse A separatists kid Yep See that shimmering mark that starts on the top of his wrist Its a relic from the rebellion I lift my eyebrows in surprise The only relics Ive ever heard of are when a dragon uses magic to mark the skin of their bonded rider But those relics are a symbol of honor and power and generally in the shape of the dragon who gifted them These marks are swirls and slashes that feel more like a warning than a claiming A dragon did that I whisper She nods Mom says General Melgrens dragon did it to all of them when he executed their parents but she wasnt exactly open to further discussion on the topic Nothing like punishing the kids to deter more parents from committing treason It seemscruel but the first rule of living at Basgiath is never question a dragon They tend to cremate anyone they find rude Most of the marked kids who carry rebellion relics are from Tyrrendor of course but there are a few whose parents turned traitor from the other provinces The blood drains from her face and she grips the straps of my pack turning me to face her I just remembered Her voice drops and I lean in my heart jumping at the urgency in her tone Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson The air rushes from my lungs That name That Xaden Riorson she confirms fear lacing her gaze Hes a thirdyear and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are His father was the Great Betrayer He led the rebellion I say quietly What is Xaden doing here All the children of the leaders were conscripted as punishment for their parents crimes Mira whispers as we shuffle sideways moving with the line Mom told me they never expected Riorson to make it past the parapet Then they figured a cadet would kill him but once his dragon chose him She shakes her head Well theres nothing much that can be done then Hes risen to the rank of wingleader Thats bullshit I seethe Hes sworn allegiance to Navarre but I dont think that will stop him where youre concerned Once you get across the parapetbecause you will make it acrossfind Dain Hell put you in his squad and well just hope its far from Riorson She grips my straps tighter Stay Away From Him Noted I nod Next a voice calls from behind the wooden table that bears the rolls of the Riders Quadrant The marked rider I dont know is seated next to a scribe I do and Captain Fitzgibbonss silver eyebrows rise over his weathered face Violet Sorrengail I nod picking up the quill and signing my name on the next empty line on the roll But I thought you were meant for the Scribe Quadrant Captain Fitzgibbons says softly I envy his creamcolored tunic unable to find the words General Sorrengail chose otherwise Mira supplies Sadness fills the older mans eyes Pity You had so much promise By the gods the rider next to Captain Fitzgibbons says Youre Mira Sorrengail His jaw drops and I can smell his hero worship from here I am She nods This is my sister Violet Shell be a firstyear If she survives the parapet Someone behind me snickers Wind just might blow her right off You fought at Strythmore the rider behind the desk says with awe They gave you the Order of the Talon for taking out that battery behind enemy lines The snickering stops As I was saying Mira puts a hand at the small of my back This is my sister Violet You know the way The Captain nods and points to the open door into the turret It looks ominously dark in there and I fight the urge to run like hell I know the way she assures him leading me past the table so the snickering asshole behind me can sign the roll We pause at the doorway and turn toward each other Dont die Violet Id hate to be an only child She grins and walks away sauntering past the line of gawking candidates as word spreads of exactly who she is and what shes done Tough to live up to that the woman ahead of me says from just inside the tower It is I agree gripping the straps of my rucksack and heading into the darkness My eyes adjust quickly to the dim light coming in through the equidistant windows along the curved staircase Sorrengail as in the woman asks looking over her shoulder as we begin to climb the hundreds of stairs that lead to our possible deaths Yep Theres no railing so I keep my hand on the stone wall as we rise higher and higher The general the blond guy ahead of us asks The same one I answer offering him a quick smile Anyone whose mother holds on that tight cant be that bad right Wow Nice leathers too He smiles back Thanks Theyre courtesy of my sister I wonder how many candidates have fallen off the edge of the steps and died before they even reach the parapet the woman says glancing down the center of the staircase as we climb higher Two last year I tilt my head when she glances back Well three if you count the girl one of the guys landed on The womans brown eyes flare but she turns back around and keeps climbing How many steps are there she asks Two hundred and fifty I answer and we climb in silence for another five minutes Not too bad she says with a bright smile as we near the top and the line comes to a halt Im Rhiannon Matthias by the way Dylan the blond guy responds with an enthusiastic wave Violet I give them a tense smile of my own blatantly ignoring Miras earlier suggestion that I avoid friendships and only forge alliances I feel like Ive been waiting my entire life for this day Dylan shifts his pack on his back Can you believe we actually get to do this Its a dream come true Right Naturally every other candidate but me is excited to be here This is the only quadrant at Basgiath that doesnt accept conscriptsonly volunteers I cant fucking wait Rhiannons smile widens I mean who wouldnt want to ride a dragon Me Not that it doesnt sound fun in theory It does Its just the abhorrent odds of surviving to graduation that sour my stomach Do your parents approve Dylan asks Because my moms been begging me to change my mind for months I keep telling her that Ill have better chances for advancement as a rider but she wanted me to enter the Healer Quadrant Mine always knew I wanted this so theyve been pretty supportive Besides they have my twin to dote on Raegans already living her dream married and expecting a baby Rhiannon glances back at me What about you Let me guess With a name like Sorrengail I bet you were the first to volunteer this year I was more like voluntold My answer is far less enthusiastic than hers Gotcha And riders do get way better perks than other officers I say to Dylan as the line moves upward again The snickering candidate behind me catches up sweating and red Look who isnt snickering now Better pay more leniency with the uniform policy I continue No one gives a shit what riders wear as long as its black The only rules that apply to riders are the ones Ive memorized from the Codex And the right to call yourself a supreme badass Rhiannon adds That too I agree Pretty sure they issue you an ego with your flight leathers Plus Ive heard that riders are allowed to marry sooner than the other quadrants Dylan adds True Right after graduation If we survive I think it has something to do with wanting to continue bloodlines Most successful riders are legacies Or because we tend to die sooner than the other quadrants Rhiannon muses Im not dying Dylan says with way more confidence than I feel as he tugs a necklace from under his tunic to reveal a ring dangling from the chain She said it would be bad luck to propose before I left so were waiting until graduation He kisses the ring and tucks the chain back under his collar The next three years are going to be long ones but theyll be worth it I keep my sigh to myself though that might be the most romantic thing Ive ever heard You might make it across the parapet the guy behind us sneers This one here is a breeze away from the bottom of the ravine I roll my eyes Shut up and focus on yourself Rhiannon snaps her feet clicking against the stone as we climb The top comes into sight the doorway full of muddled light Mira was right Those clouds are going to wreak havoc on us and we have to be on the other side of the parapet before they do Another step another tap of Rhiannons feet Let me see your boots I say quietly so the jerk behind me cant hear Her brow puckers and confusion fills her brown eyes but she shows me the soles Theyre smooth just like the ones I was wearing earlier My stomach sinks like a rock The line starts moving again pausing when were only a few feet from the opening What size are your feet I ask What Rhiannon blinks at me Your feet What size are they Eight she answers two lines forming between her brows Im a seven I say quickly It will hurt like hell but I want you to take my left boot Trade with me I have a dagger in the right one Im sorry She looks at me like Ive lost my mind and maybe I have These are rider boots Theyll grip the stone better Your toes will be scrunched and generally miserable but at least youll have a shot at not falling off if that rain hits Rhiannon glances toward the open doorand the darkening skythen back to me Youre willing to trade a boot Just until we get on the other side I look through the open door Three candidates are already walking across the parapet their arms stretched out wide But we have to be quick Its almost our turn Rhiannon purses her lips in debate for a second then agrees and we swap left boots I barely finish lacing up before the line moves again and the guy behind me shoves my lower back sending me staggering onto the platform and into the open air Lets go Some of us have things to do on the other side His voice grates on my last freaking nerve You are not worth the effort right now I mutter gaining my balance as the wind whips at my skin the midsummer morning thick with humidity Good call on the braid Mira The top of the turret is bare the crenelations of stone rising and falling along the circular structure at the height of my chest and doing nothing to obscure the view The ravine and its river below suddenly feel very very far How many wagons do they have waiting down there Five Six I know the stats The parapet claims roughly fifteen percent of the rider candidates Every trial in the quadrantincluding this oneis designed to test a cadets ability to ride If someone cant manage to walk the windy length of the slim stone bridge then they sure as hell cant keep their balance and fight on the back of a dragon And as for the death rate I guess every other rider thinks the risk is worth the gloryor has the arrogance to think they wont fall Im not in either camp Nausea has me holding my stomach and I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth as I walk the edge behind Rhiannon and Dylan my fingers skimming the stonework as we wind our way toward the parapet Three riders wait at the entrance which is nothing more than a gaping hole in the wall of the turret One with rippedoff sleeves records names as candidates step out onto the treacherous crossing Another whos shaved all his hair with the exception of a strip down the top center instructs Dylan as he moves into position patting his chest like the ring hidden there will bring him luck I hope it does The third turns in my direction and my heart simplystops Hes tall with windblown black hair and dark brows The line of his jaw is strong and covered by warm tawny skin and dark stubble and when he folds his arms across his torso the muscles in his chest and arms ripple moving in a way that makes me swallow And his eyes His eyes are the shade of goldflecked onyx The contrast is startling jawdropping eveneverything about him is His features are so harsh that they look carved and yet theyre astonishingly perfect like an artist worked a lifetime sculpting him and at least a year of that was spent on his mouth Hes the most exquisite man Ive ever seen And living in the war college means Ive seen a lot of men Even the diagonal scar that bisects his left eyebrow and marks the top corner of his cheek only makes him hotter Flaming hot Scorching hot Getsyouintotroubleandyoulikeit level of hot Suddenly I cant remember exactly why Mira told me not to fuck around outside my year group See you two on the other side Dylan says over his shoulder with an excited grin before stepping onto the parapet his arms spread wide Ready for the next one Riorson the rider with the ripped sleeves says Xaden Riorson You ready for this Sorrengail Rhiannon asks moving forward The blackhaired rider snaps his gaze to mine turning fully toward me and my heart thunders for all the wrong reasons A rebellion relic curving in dips and swirls starts at his bare left wrist then disappears under his black uniform to appear again at his collar where it stretches and swirls up his neck stopping at his jawline Oh shit I whisper and his eyes narrow as if he can hear me over the howl of wind that rips at my secured braid Sorrengail He steps toward me and I look upand up Good gods I dont even reach his collarbone Hes massive He has to be more than four inches over six feet tall I feel exactly what Mira called mefragilebut I nod once and the shining onyx of his eyes transforms to cold unadulterated hatred I can almost taste the loathing wafting off him like a bitter cologne Violet Rhiannon asks moving forward Youre General Sorrengails youngest His voice is deep and accusatory Youre Fen Riorsons son I counter the certainty of this revelation settling in my bones I lift my chin and do my best to lock every muscle in my body so I dont start trembling He will kill you the second he finds out who you are Miras words bounce around my skull and fear knots in my throat Hes going to throw me over the edge Hes going to pick me up and drop me right off this turret Im never going to get the chance to even walk the parapet Ill die being exactly what my mothers always danced around calling meweak Xaden sucks in a deep breath and the muscle in his jaw flexes once Twice Your mother captured my father and oversaw his execution Wait Like he has the only right to hatred here Rage races through my veins Your father killed my older brother Seems like were even Hardly His glaring gaze strokes over me like hes memorizing every detail or looking for any weakness Your sister is a rider Guess that explains the leathers Guess so I hold his glare as if winning this staring competition will gain me entrance to the quadrant instead of crossing the parapet behind him Either way Im getting across Mira isnt going to lose both her siblings His hands clench into fists and he tenses I prepare for the strike He might throw me off this tower but I wont make it easy for him You all right Rhiannon asks her gaze jumping between Xaden and me He glances at her Youre friends We met on the stairs she says squaring her shoulders He looks down noting our mismatched shoes and arches a brow His hands relax Interesting Are you going to kill me I lift my chin another inch His gaze clashes with mine as the sky opens and rain falls in a deluge soaking my hair my leathers and the stones around us in seconds A scream rends the air and Rhiannon and I both jerk our attention to the parapet just in time to see Dylan slip I gasp my heart jolting into my throat He catches himself hooking his arms over the stone bridge as his feet kick beneath him scrambling for a purchase that isnt there Pull yourself up Dylan Rhiannon shouts Oh gods My hand flies to cover my mouth but he loses his grip on the waterslick stone and falls disappearing from view The wind and rain steal any sound his body might make in the valley below They steal the sound of my muffled cry too Xaden never takes his eyes from me watching silently with a look I cant interpret as I bring my horrified gaze back to his Why would I waste my energy killing you when the parapet will do it for me A wicked smile curves his lips Your turn Theres a misconception that its kill or be killed in the Riders Quadrant Riders as a whole arent out to assassinate other cadetsunless theres a shortage of dragons that year or a cadet is a liability to their wing Then things may getinteresting Major Afendras Guide to the Riders Quadrant Unauthorized Edition CHAPTER TWO I will not die today The words become my mantra repeating in my head as Rhiannon gives her name to the rider keeping tally at the opening to the parapet The hatred in Xadens stare burns the side of my face like a palpable flame and even the rain pelting my skin with each gust of wind doesnt ease the heator the shiver of dread that jolts down my spine Dylan is dead Hes just a name another soontobe stone in the endless graveyards that line the roads to Basgiath another warning to the ambitious candidates who would rather chance their lives with the riders than choose the security of any other quadrant I get it nowwhy Mira warned me not to make friends Rhiannon grips both sides of the opening in the turret then looks over her shoulder at me Ill wait for you on the other side she shouts over the storm The fear in her eyes mirrors my own Ill see you on the other side I nod and even manage a grimace of a smile She steps out onto the parapet and begins walking and even though Im sure his hands are full today I send up a silent prayer to Zihnal the god of luck Name the rider at the edge asks as his partner holds a cloak over the scroll in a pointless attempt to keep the paper dry Violet Sorrengail I answer as thunder cracks above me the sound oddly comforting Ive always loved the nights where storms beat against the fortress window both illuminating and throwing shadows over the books I curled up with though this downpour might just cost me my life With a quick glance I see Dylans and Rhiannons names already blurring at the end where water has met ink Its the last time Dylans name will be written anywhere but his stone There will be another roll at the end of the parapet so the scribes have their beloved statistics for casualties In another life it would be me reading and recording the data for historical analysis Sorrengail The rider looks up his eyebrows rising in surprise As in General Sorrengail The same Damn thats already getting old and I know its only going to get worse Theres no avoiding the comparison to my mother not when shes the commander here Even worse they probably think Im a naturally gifted rider like Mira or a brilliant strategist like Brennan was Or theyll take one look at me realize Im nothing like the three of them and declare open season I place my hands on either side of the turret and drag my fingertips across the stone Its still warm from the morning sun but rapidly cooling from the rain slick but not slippery from moss growth or anything Ahead of me Rhiannon is making her way across her hands out for balance Shes probably a fourth of the way her figure becoming blurrier the farther she walks into the rain I thought she only had one daughter the other rider asks angling the cloak as another gust of wind blows into us If its this windy here my bottom half sheltered by the turret then Im about to be in for a world of hurt on the parapet I get that a lot In through my nose out through my mouth I force my breathing to calm my heart rate to slow from its gallop If I panic Ill die If I slip Ill die If I Oh fuck it Theres nothing more I can do to prepare for this I take the lone step up onto the parapet and grip the stone wall as another gust hits knocking me sideways against the opening in the turret And you think youll be able to ride the asshole candidate behind me mocks Some Sorrengail with that kind of balance I pity whatever wing you end up in I regain my balance and yank the straps of my pack tighter Name the rider asks again but I know hes not talking to me Jack Barlowe the one behind me answers Remember the name Im going to be a wingleader one day Even his voice reeks of arrogance Youd better get going Sorrengail Xadens deep voice orders I look over my shoulder and see him pinning me with a glare Unless you need a little motivation Jack lunges forward his hands raised Holy shit hes going to shove me off Fear shoots through my veins and I move leaving the safety of the turret as I bolt onto the parapet Theres no going back now My heart beats so hard that I hear it in my ears like a drum Keep your eyes on the stones ahead of you and dont look down Miras advice echoes in my head but its hard to heed it when every step could be my last I throw my arms out for balance then take the measured mini strides I practiced with Major Gillstead in the courtyard But with the wind the rain and the twohundredfoot drop this is nothing like practice The stones beneath my feet are uneven in places held together by mortar in the joints that make it easy to trip and I concentrate on the path ahead of me to keep my eyes off my boots My muscles are tight as I lock my center of gravity keeping my posture upright My head swims as my pulse skyrockets Calm I have to stay calm I cant carry a tune or even decently hum so singing for a distraction is out but I am a scholar Theres nowhere as calming as the archives so thats what I think of Facts Logic History Your mind already knows the answer so just calm down and let it remember Thats what Dad always told me I need something to keep the logical side of my brain from turning around and walking straight back to the turret The Continent is home to two kingdomsand weve been at war for four hundred years I recite using the basic simple data that has been drilled into me for easy recall in preparation for the scribes test Step after step I make my way across the parapet Navarre my home is the larger kingdom with six unique provinces Tyrrendor our southernmost and largest province shares its border with the province of Krovla within the Poromiel kingdom Each word calms my breathing and steadies my heart rate lessening the dizziness To our east lie the remaining two Poromiel provinces of Braevick and Cygnisen with the Esben Mountains providing a natural border I pass the painted line that marks halfway Im over the highest point now but I cant think about that Dont look down Beyond Krovla beyond our enemy lie the distant Barrens a desert Thunder cracks the wind slams into me and I flail my arms Shit My body sways left with the gale and I drop to the parapet holding on to the edges and crouching so I dont lose my footing making myself as small as possible as the wind howls over and around me Stomach churning I feel my lungs threaten to hyperventilate as panic seizes me at knifepoint Within Navarre Tyrrendor was the last of the bordering provinces to join the alliance and swear fealty to King Reginald I shout into the howling wind forcing my mind to keep moving against the very real threat of paralyzing anxiety It was also the only province to attempt secession six hundred and twentyseven years later which would have eventually left our kingdom defenseless had they been successful Rhiannon is still ahead of me at what I think is the threequarters point Good She deserves to make it The kingdom of Poromiel mainly consists of arable plains and marshlands and is known for exceptional textiles endless fields of grain and unique crystalline gems capable of amplifying minor magics I spare only a quick glance at the dark clouds above me before inching forward one foot carefully placed in front of the other In contrast Navarres mountainous regions offer an abundance in ore hardy timber from our eastern provinces and limitless deer and elk My next step knocks a couple of pieces of mortar loose and I pause as my arms wobble until I regain my balance I swallow and test my weight before moving forward again The Trade Agreement of Resson signed more than two hundred years ago ensures the exchange of meat and lumber from Navarre for the cloth and agriculture within Poromiel four times a year at the Athebyne outpost on the border of Krovla and Tyrrendor I can see the Riders Quadrant from here The enormous stone footings of the citadel rise up the mountain to the base of the structure where I know this path ends if I can just get there Scraping the rain from my face with the leather on my shoulder I glance back to see where Jack is Hes stalled at just after the quarter mark his stocky form standing stilllike hes waiting for something His hands are at his sides The wind seems to have no effect on his balance lucky bastard I swear hes grinning across the distance but it could just be the rain in my eyes I cant stay here Living to see the sunrise means I have to keep moving Fear cant rule my body Squeezing the muscles of my legs together for balance I slowly let go of the stone beneath me and stand Arms out Walk I need to get as far as possible before the next gust of wind I look back over my shoulder to see where Jack is and my blood chills to ice Hes turned his back on me and is facing the next candidate who wobbles dangerously as he approaches Jack grabs the gangly boy by the straps of his overpacked rucksack and I watch shock locking my muscles as Jack throws the scrawny candidate from the parapet like a sack of grain A scream reaches my ears for an instant before fading as he falls out of sight Holy shit Youre next Sorrengail Jack bellows and I jerk my gaze from the ravine to see him pointing at me a sinister smile curving his mouth Then he comes for me his strides eating up the distance between us with horrifying speed Move Now Tyrrendor encompasses the southwest of the Continent I recite my steps even but panicked on the slick narrow path my left foot slipping a little at the beginning of each step Made up of hostile mountainous terrain and bordered by the Emerald Sea to the west and the Arctile Ocean to the south Tyrrendor is nearly impenetrable Though separated geographically by the Cliffs of Dralor a natural protective barrier Another gust slams into me and my foot slips off the parapet My heart lurches The parapet rushes up to meet me as I stumble and fall My knee slams into the stone and I yelp at the sharp bite of pain My hands scramble for purchase as my left leg dangles off the edge of this bridge from hell Jack not far behind now Then I make the guttwisting error of looking down Water runs off my nose and chin splattering against the stone before falling to join the river gushing through the valley more than two hundred feet below I swallow the growing knot in my throat and blink fighting to steady my heart rate I will not die today Gripping the sides of the stone I brace as much of my weight as I can trust on the slick stones to hold and swing my left leg up The ball of my foot finds the walkway From here there arent enough facts in the world to steady my thoughts I need to get my right foot under me the one that has better traction but one wrong move and Ill find out just how cold that river is beneath me Youll be dead on impact Im coming for you Sorrengail I hear from behind me I shove off the stone and pray my boots find the pathway as I burst to my feet If I fall fine that would be my error But Im not about to let this asshole murder me Best to get to the other side where the rest of the murderers wait Not that everyone in the quadrant is going to try to kill me just the cadets who think Ill be a liability to the wing Theres a reason strength is revered among riders A squad a section a wing is only as effective as its weakest link and if that link breaks it puts everyone in danger Jack either thinks Im that link or hes an unstable asshole who just enjoys killing Probably both Either way I need to move faster Throwing my arms out to the side I focus on the end of the path the courtyard of the citadel where Rhiannon steps to safety and I hustle despite the rain I keep my body tight my center locked and for once am grateful Im shorter than most Will you scream the whole way down Jack mocks still shouting but his voice is closer Hes gaining on me Theres no room for fear so I block it out envisioning shoving the emotion behind locked iron bars in my mind I can see the end of the parapet now the riders who wait at the entrance to the citadel Theres no way someone who cant even carry a full rucksack passed the entrance exam Youre a mistake Sorrengail Jack calls out his voice clearer but I dont chance losing my speed to check how far he is behind me Its really for the best that I take you out now dont you think Its so much more merciful than letting the dragons have at you Theyll start to eat you leg by rickety leg while youre still alive Come on he cajoles It will be my pleasure to help you out The fuck you will I mutter There are only a dozen feet left to the outside of the citadels enormous walls My left foot slips and I wobble but I only lose a heartbeat before Im moving forward again The fortress looms behind those thick battlements carved into the mountain in an Lshaped formation of tall stone buildings built to withstand fire for obvious reasons The walls that surround the citadels courtyard are ten feet thick and eight feet tall with one openingand Im just About There I bite back a sob of relief as stone rises up on both sides of me You think youll be safe in there Jacks voice is harshand close Secure on both sides by the walls I run the last ten feet my heart pounding as adrenaline pushes my body to its max and his footsteps charge behind me He lunges for my pack and misses his hand hitting my hip as we reach the edge I hurtle forward jumping the twelve inches off the elevated parapet down to the courtyard where two riders wait Jack roars in frustration and the sound grips my heaving chest like a vise Spinning I rip a dagger from its sheath at my ribs just as Jack skids to a halt above me on the parapet his breath choppy and his face ruddy Murder is etched in his narrowed glacial blue eyes as he glares down at meand where the tip of my dagger now indents the fabric of his breechesagainst his balls I think Ill be safe For right Now I manage between ragged breaths my muscles trembling but my hand more than steady Will you Jack vibrates with rage his thick blond brows slashing down over arctic blue eyes every line of his monstrous frame leaning my way But he doesnt take another step It is unlawful for a rider to cause another harm While in a quadrant formation or in the supervisory Presence of a superiorranking cadet I recite from the Codex my heartbeat still in my throat As it will diminish the efficacy of the wing And given the crowd behind us I think its clear to argue that its a formation Article Three Section I dont give a shit He moves but I hold my ground and my dagger slices through the first layer of his breeches I suggest you reconsider I adjust my stance just in case he doesnt I might slip Name the rider next to me drawls as if were the least interesting thing shes seen today I glance in her direction for a millisecond She pushes the chinlength firered strands of her hair behind her ear with one hand and holds the roll with the other watching the scene play out The three silver fourpoint stars embroidered on the shoulder of her cloak tell me shes a thirdyear Youre pretty small for a rider but it looks like you made it Violet Sorrengail I answer but a hundred percent of my focus is on Jack again The rain drips off the lowered ridge of his brow And before you ask yes Im that Sorrengail Not surprised with that maneuver the woman says holding a pen like Mom uses over the roll It might be the nicest compliment Ive ever been given And whats your name she asks again Pretty sure shes asking Jack but Im too busy studying my opponent to glance her way Jack Barlowe Theres no sinister little smile on his lips or playful taunts about how hell enjoy killing me now Theres nothing but pure malice in his features promising retribution A chill of apprehension lifts the hairs on my neck Well Jack the male rider on my right says slowly scratching the trim lines of his dark goatee Hes not wearing a cloak and the rain soaks into the bevy of patches stitched into a worn leather jacket Cadet Sorrengail has you by the actual balls here in more ways than one Shes right Regs state that theres nothing but respect among riders at formation You want to kill her youll have to do it in the sparring ring or on your own time That is if she decides to let you off the parapet Because technically youre not on the grounds yet so you are not a cadet She is And if I decide to snap her neck the second I step down Jack growls and the look in his eyes says hell do it Then you get to meet the dragons early the redhead answers her tone bland We dont wait for trials around here We just execute Whats it going to be Sorrengail the male rider asks You going to have Jack here start as a eunuch Shit What is it going to be I cant kill him not at this angle and slicing off his balls is only going to make him hate me more if possible Are you going to follow the rules I ask Jack My head is buzzing and my arm feels so damned heavy but I keep my knife on target Guess I dont have a choice A corner of his mouth tilts into a sneer and his posture relaxes as he raises his hands palms out I lower my dagger but keep it palmed and ready as I move sideways toward the redhead keeping roll Jack steps down into the courtyard his shoulder knocking mine as he walks by pausing to lean in close Youre dead Sorrengail and Im going to be the one to kill you Blue dragons descend from the extraordinary Gormfaileas line Known for their formidable size they are the most ruthless especially in the case of the rare Blue Daggertail whose knifelike spikes at the tip of their tail can disembowel an enemy with one flick Colonel Kaoris Field Guide to Dragonkind CHAPTER THREE If Jack wants to kill me he needs to get in line Besides I have a feeling Xaden Riorson is going to beat him to it Not today I respond to Jack the hilt of my dagger solid in my hand and I somehow manage to suppress a shudder as he leans over and breathes in Hes scenting me like a fucking dog Then he scoffs and walks off into the crowd of celebrating cadets and riders thats gathered in the sizable courtyard of the citadel Its still early probably around nine but already I see there arent as many cadets as there were candidates ahead of me in line Based on the overwhelming presence of leather both the second and thirdyears are here as well taking stock of the new cadets The rain eases into a drizzle as if it had only come to make the hardest test of my life even harderbut I did it Im alive I made it My body begins to tremble and a throbbing pain erupts in my left kneethe one I slammed on the parapet I take a step and it threatens to give out on me I need to bind it before anyone notices I think you made an enemy there the redhead says casually shifting the lethal crossbow she wears strapped along her shoulder She glances at me over the scroll with a shrewd look in her hazel eyes as she looks me up and down Id watch your back with that one if I were you I nod Im going to have to watch my back and every other part of my body The next candidate approaches from the parapet as someone grips my shoulders from behind and spins me My dagger is halfway up when I realize its Rhiannon We made it She grins giving my shoulders a squeeze We made it I repeat with a forced smile My thighs are shaking now but I manage to sheath my dagger at my ribs Now that were here both cadets can I trust her I cant thank you enough There were at least three times I would have fallen off if you hadnt helped me You were rightthose soles were slick as shit Have you seen the people around here I swear I just saw a secondyear with pink streaks in her hair and one guy has dragon scales tattooed up his entire biceps Conformity is for the infantry I say as she loops her arm through mine and tugs me along toward the crowd My knee screams pain radiating up to my hip and down to my foot and I limp my weight falling into Rhiannons side Damn it Where did this nausea come from Why cant I stop shaking Im going to fall any second nowtheres no way my body can remain upright with this earthquake in my legs or the whirring in my head Speaking of which she says glancing down We need to trade boots Theres a bench A tall figure in a pristine black uniform steps out of the crowd charging toward us and though Rhiannon manages to dodge I stumble smack into his chest Violet Strong hands catch my elbows to steady me and I look up into a pair of familiar striking brown eyes flared wide in obvious shock Relief sweeps through me and I try to smile but it probably comes out like a distorted grimace He seems taller than he was last summer the beard that cuts across his jaw is new and hes filled out in a way that makes me blinkor maybe thats just my vision going hazy at the edges The beautiful easygoing smile thats starred in way too many of my fantasies is far from the scowl that purses his mouth and everything about him seems a littleharder but it works for him The line of his chin the set of his brow even the muscles of his biceps are rigid under my fingers as I try to find my balance Sometime in the last year Dain Aetos went from attractive and cute to gorgeous And Im about to be sick all over his boots What the hell are you doing here he barks the shock in his eyes transforming to something foreign something deadly This isnt the same boy I grew up with Hes a secondyear rider now Dain Its good to see you Thats an understatement but the trembles turn to fullon shakes and bile creeps up my throat dizziness only making the nausea worse My knees give out Damn it Violet he mutters hauling me back to my feet With one hand on my back and the other under my elbow he quickly guides me away from the crowd and into an alcove in the wall close to the first defensive turret of the citadel Its a shady hidden spot with a hard wooden bench which he sits me on then helps me out of my rucksack Spit floods my mouth Im going to be sick Head between your knees Dain orders in a harsh tone Im not used to from him but I do it He rubs circles on my lower back as I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth Its the adrenaline Give it a minute and itll pass I hear approaching footsteps on the gravel Who the hell are you Im Rhiannon Im Violetsfriend I stare at the gravel under my mismatched boots and will the meager contents of my stomach to stay put Listen to me Rhiannon Violet is fine he commands And if anyone asks then you tell them exactly what I said that its just the adrenaline working out of her system Understand Its no ones business whats going on with Violet she retorts her tone just as sharp as his So I wouldnt say shit Especially not when shes the reason I made it across the parapet Youd better mean that he warns the bite in his voice at odds with the ceaseless comforting circles he makes on my back I could ask you just who the hell you are she retorts Hes one of my oldest friends The trembles slowly subside and the nausea wanes but Im not sure if its from timing or my position so I keep my head between my knees while I manage to unlace my left boot Oh Rhiannon answers And a secondyear rider cadet he growls Gravel crunches like Rhiannon has backed up a step No one can see you here Vi so take your time Dain says softly Because puking my guts up after surviving the parapet and the asshole who wanted to throw me off it would be considered weak I rise slowly sitting upright Exactly he answers Are you hurt His gaze rakes over me with a desperate edge like he needs to see every inch for himself My knee is sore I admit in a whisper because its Dain Dain whom Ive known since we were five and six Dain whose father is one of my mothers most trusted advisers Dain who held me together when Mira left for the Riders Quadrant and again when Brennan died He takes my chin between his thumb and forefinger turning my face left and right for his inspection Thats all Youre sure His hands run down my sides and pause at my ribs Are you wearing daggers Rhiannon takes my boot off and sighs in relief wiggling her toes I nod Three at my ribs and one in my boot Thank gods or Im not sure Id be sitting here right now Huh He drops his hands and looks at me like hes never seen me before like Im a complete stranger but then he blinks and its gone Get your boots switched You two look ridiculous Vi do you trust this one He nods toward Rhiannon She could have waited for me at the security of the citadel walls and thrown me off just like Jack tried to do but she didnt I nod I trust her as much as anyone can trust another firstyear around here All right He stands and turns toward her There are sheaths at the sides of his leathers too but there are daggers in each of them where mine are still empty Im Dain Aetos and Im the leader for Second Squad Flame Section Second Wing Squad leader My brows jump The highest ranks among the cadets in the quadrant are wingleader and section leader Both positions are held by elite thirdyears Secondyears can rise to squad leaders but only if theyre exceptional Everyone else is simply a cadet before Threshingwhen the dragons choose who they will bondand a rider after People die too often around here to hand out ranks prematurely Parapet should be over in the next couple of hours depending on how fast the candidates cross or fall Go find the redhead with the rollshes usually carrying a crossbowand tell her that Dain Aetos put both you and Violet Sorrengail into his squad If she questions you tell her she owes me from saving her ass at Threshing last year Ill bring Violet back to the courtyard shortly Rhiannon glances at me and I nod Go before someone sees us Dain barks Going she answers shoving her foot into her boot and lacing it quickly as I do the same with mine You crossed the parapet with an equestrian boot too big for you Dain asks glaring down at me with incredulity She would have died without trading mine I stand and wince as my knee objects and tries to buckle And youre going to die if we dont find you a way out of here He offers his arm Take it We need to get you to my room You need to wrap that knee His eyebrows rise Unless you found some miracle cure I dont know about in the last year I shake my head and take his arm Damn it Violet Damn it He tucks mine discreetly against his side grabs my rucksack with his empty hand then leads me into a tunnel at the end of the alcove in the outer wall I hadnt even seen Mage lights flicker on in the sconces as we pass and extinguish after we go by Youre not supposed to be here Well aware I let myself limp a little since no one can see us now Youre supposed to be in the Scribe Quadrant he seethes leading me through the tunnel in the wall What the hell happened Please tell me you did not volunteer for the Riders Quadrant What do you think happened I challenge as we reach a wroughtiron gate that looks like it was built to keep out a trollor a dragon He curses Your mother My mother I nod Every Sorrengail is a rider dont you know We make it to a set of circular steps and Dain leads me up past the first and second floor stopping us on the third and pushing open another gate that creaks with the sound of metal on metal This is the secondyear floor he explains quietly Which means Im not supposed to be up here obviously I tuck in a little closer Dont worryif someone sees us Ill just say that I was overcome with lust at first sight and couldnt wait another second to get you out of your pants Ever the smartass A wry smile tugs at his lips as we start down the hall I can throw in a few oh Dain cries once were in your room just for believability I offer and actually mean it He snorts as he drops my pack in front of a wooden door then makes a twisting motion with his hand in front of the handle A lock audibly clicks You have powers I say Its not news of course Hes a secondyear rider and all riders can perform lesser magics once their dragons choose to channel their powerbut itsDain Dont look so surprised He rolls his eyes and opens the door carrying my pack as he helps me inside His room is simple with a bed dresser desk and wardrobe Theres nothing personal about it other than a few books on his desk I note with a tiny burst of satisfaction that one is the tome on the Krovlan language that I gave him before he left last summer Hes always had a gift for languages Even the blanket on his bed is simple rider black as if he might forget why hes here while sleeping The window is arched and I move toward it I can see the rest of Basgiath across the ravine through the clear glass Its the same war college and yet an entire world away There are two more candidates on the parapet but I look away before I can feel invested just to watch them fall There is only so much death one person can take in a day and Im at my fucking maximum Do you have wraps in here He hands me the rucksack Got them all from Major Gillstead I answer with a nod plopping down on the edge of his expertly made bed and starting to dig through my pack Luckily for me Mira is an infinitely better packer than I am and the wraps are easy to spot Make yourself at home He grins leaning back against the closed door and hooking one ankle over the other As much as I hate that youre here I have to say its more than nice to see your face Vi I look up and our eyes meet The tension thats been in my chest for the last weekhell the last six monthseases and for a second its just us Ive missed you Maybe its exposing a weakness but I dont care Dain knows almost everything there is to know about me anyway Yeah Ive missed you too he says quietly his eyes softening My chest draws tight and theres an awareness between us an almost tangible sense ofanticipation as he looks at me Maybe after all these years were finally on the same page when it comes to wanting each other Or maybe hes just relieved to see an old friend Youd better get that leg wrapped He turns around to face the door I wont look Its nothing you havent seen before I arch my hips and shimmy my leather pants down past my thighs and over my knees Shit The one on the left is swollen If anyone else had taken that stumble they would have ended up with a bruise maybe even a scrape But me I have to fix it so my kneecap stays where its supposed to Its not just my muscles that are weak My ligaments that hold my joints together dont work for shit either Yeah well were not sneaking away to swim in the river are we he teases We grew up together through every post our parents had been stationed at and no matter where we were we always managed to find a place to swim and trees to climb I fasten the wrap at the top of my knee then wind and secure the joint in the same way Ive done since I was old enough for the healers to teach me Its a practiced motion that I could do in my sleep and the familiarity of it is almost soothing if it didnt mean I was starting in the quadrant wounded As soon as I get it fastened with the little metal clasp I stand and tug my leathers back up over my ass and button them All covered He turns and glances over me You lookdifferent Its the leathers I shrug Why Is different bad It takes a second to close my rucksack and haul it up and over my shoulders Thank you gods the ache in my knee is manageable with it bound like this Its just He shakes his head slowly teasing his lower lip with his teeth Different Why Dain Aetos I grin and walk toward him then grasp the door handle at his side Youve seen me in swimwear tunics and even ballgowns Are you telling me its the leather that does it for you He scoffs but theres a slight flush to his cheeks as his hand covers mine to open the door Glad to see our year apart hasnt dulled your tongue Vi Oh I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway I can do quite a few things with my tongue Youd be impressed My smile is so wide that it almost hurts and just for a second I forget that were in the Riders Quadrant or that Ive just survived the parapet His eyes heat Guess hes forgotten too Then again Miras always made it clear that riders arent an inhibited bunch behind these walls Theres not much reason to deny yourself when you might not live through tomorrow We have to get you out of here he says shaking his head like he needs to clear it Then he does the hand thing again and I hear the lock slide into place Theres no one in the hallway and we make it to the stairwell quickly Thanks I say as we start descending My knee feels way better now I still cant believe your mother thought putting you into the Riders Quadrant was a good idea I can practically feel the anger vibrating off him next to me as we walk down the stairs Theres no banister on his side but he doesnt seem to mind even though a single misstep would be the end of him Me neither She announced her decree about which quadrant Id choose last spring after I passed the initial entrance exam and I immediately started working with Major Gillstead Hell be so proud when he reads the rolls tomorrow and sees that Im not on them Theres a door at the bottom of this stairwell below the main level that leads to the passage into the Healers Quadrant farther up the ravine he says as we approach the first floor Well get you through that and into the Scribe Quadrant What I stop as my feet hit the polished stone landing at the main floor but he continues downward Hes already three steps beneath me when he realizes Im not with him The Scribe Quadrant he says slowly turning to face me This angle makes me taller than he is and I glare down at him I cant go to the Scribe Quadrant Dain Im sorry His eyebrows fly up She wont stand for it I shake my head His mouth opens then shuts and his fists clench at his sides This place will kill you Violet You cant stay here Everyone will understand You didnt volunteernot really Anger bristles up my spine and my gaze narrows on him Ignoring who did or did not volunteer me I snap One Im well aware of what my chances are here Dain and two usually fifteen percent of candidates dont make it past the parapet and Im still standing so I guess Im beating those odds already He backs up another step Im not saying you didnt just kick absolute ass by getting here Vi But you have to leave Youll break the first time they put you in the sparring ring and thats before the dragons sense that youre He shakes his head and looks away his jaw clenching Im what My hackles rise Go ahead and say it When they sense Im less than the others Is that what you mean Damn it He rakes his hand over his closecropped lightbrown curls Stop putting words in my mouth You know what I mean Even if you survive to Threshing theres no guarantee a dragon will bond you As it was last year we had thirtyfour unbonded cadets who have just been sitting around waiting to restart the year with this class to get a chance at bonding again and theyre all perfectly healthy Dont be an asshole My stomach falls Just because he might be right doesnt mean I want to hear itor want to be called unhealthy Im trying to keep you alive he shouts his voice echoing off the stone of the stairwell If we get you to the Scribe Quadrant right now you can still ace their test and have a phenomenal story to tell when youre out drinking I take you back out therehe points to the doorway that leads to the courtyardits out of my hands I cant protect you here Not fully Im not asking you to Waitdidnt I want him to Wasnt that what Mira suggested Why would you tell Rhiannon to put me in your squad if you just wanted to sneak me out the back door The vise around my chest squeezes tighter Next to Mira Dain is the person who knows me best on the entire damned Continent and even he thinks I cant hack it here To make her leave so I could get you out He climbs two steps shortening the distance between us but theres no give in the set of his shoulders If determination had a physical form it would be Dain Aetos right now Do you think I want to watch my best friend die Do you think itll be fun to see what theyll do to you knowing youre General Sorrengails daughter Putting on leathers doesnt make you a rider Vi Theyre going to tear you to shreds and if they dont the dragons will In the Riders Quadrant you either graduate or die and you know that Let me save you His entire posture droops and the plea in his eyes shreds some of my indignation Please let me save you You cant I whisper She said shed haul me right back I either leave here as a rider or as a name on a stone She didnt mean it He shakes his head She cant mean that She means it Even Mira couldnt talk her out of it He searches my eyes and tenses as if he sees the truth of it there Shit Yeah Shit I shrug like its not my life were talking about here All right I can see him mentally changing gears adapting to the information Well find another way For now lets go He takes my hand and leads me to the alcove we disappeared from Get out there and meet the other firstyears Ill go back and enter from the turret doorway Theyll figure out we know each other soon enough but dont give anyone ammunition He squeezes my hand and lets go walking away without another word and disappearing into the tunnel I grip the straps of my rucksack and walk into the dappled sunlight of the courtyard The clouds are breaking and the drizzle is burning off as the gravel crunches beneath my feet on my way toward the riders and cadets The massive courtyard which could easily fit a thousand riders is just like the map in the archives recorded Shaped like an angular teardrop the rounded end is formed by a giant outer wall at least ten feet thick Along the sides are stone halls I know the fourstory building carved into the mountain with the rounded end is for academics and the one on the right towering over the cliff is the dorms where Dain took me The imposing rotunda linking the two buildings also serves as the entrance to the gathering hall commons and library behind it I quit gawking and turn in the courtyard to face the outer wall Theres a stone dais on the right side of the parapet occupied by two uniformed men I recognize as the commandant and executive commandant both in full military dress their medals winking in the sunlight It takes me a few minutes to find Rhiannon in the growing crowd talking to another girl whose jetblack hair is cut just as short as Dains There you are Rhiannons smile is genuine and full of relief I was worried Is everything She lifts her eyebrows Im good to go I nod and turn toward the other woman as Rhiannon introduces us Her name is Tara and shes from the Morraine province to the north along the coast of the Emerald Sea She has that same air of confidence Mira does and her eyes dance with excitement as she and Rhiannon talk about how theyve both obsessed over dragons since childhood I pay attention but only enough to recall details if we need to form an alliance An hour passes then another according to the Basgiath bells which we can hear from here Then the last of the cadets walks into the courtyard followed by the three riders from the other turret Xaden is among them Its not just his height that makes him stand out in this crowd but the way the other riders all seem to move around him like hes a shark and theyre all fish giving him a wide berth For a second I cant help but wonder what his signet is the unique power from the bond with his dragon and if thats why even the thirdyears seem to scurry out of his way as he strides up to the dais with lethal grace There are ten of them in total up there now and from the way Commandant Panchek moves to the front facing us I think were about to start I say to Rhiannon and Tara and they both turn to face the dais Everyone does Three hundred and one of you have survived the parapet to become cadets today Commandant Panchek starts with a politicians smile gesturing to us The guy has always talked with his hands Good job Sixtyseven did not My chest clenches as my brain spins the calculation quickly Almost twenty percent Was it the rain The wind Thats more than average Sixtyseven people died trying to get here Ive heard this position is just a stepping stone for him Tara whispers He wants Sorrengails job then General Melgrens The commanding general of all Navarres forces Melgrens beady eyes have always made me shrivel every time weve met during my mothers career General Melgrens Rhiannon whispers from my other side Hell never get it I say quietly as the commandant welcomes us to the Riders Quadrant Melgrens dragon gives him the signet ability to see a battles outcome before it happens Theres no beating that and you cant be assassinated if you know its coming As the Codex says now you begin the true crucible Panchek shouts his voice carrying over the five hundred of us that I estimate are in this courtyard You will be tested by your superiors hunted by your peers and guided by your instincts If you survive to Threshing and if you are chosen you will be riders Then well see how many of you make it to graduation Statistics say about a quarter of us will live to graduate give or take a few on any year and yet the Riders Quadrant is never short volunteers Every cadet in this courtyard thinks they have what it takes to be one of the elite the very best Navarre has to offera dragon rider I cant help but wonder for the smallest of seconds if maybe I do too Maybe I can do more than just survive Your instructors will teach you Panchek promises his hand sweeping to the line of professors standing at the doors to the academic wing Its up to you how well you learn He swings his pointer finger at us Discipline falls to your units and your wingleader is the last word If I have to get involved A slow sinister smile spreads across his face You dont want me involved With that said Ill leave you to your wingleaders My best advice Dont die He walks off the dais with the executive commandant leaving only the riders on the stone stage A brunette woman with wide shoulders and a scarred sneer stalks forward the silver spikes on the shoulders of her uniform flashing in the sunlight Im Nyra the senior wingleader of the quadrant and the head of the First Wing Section leaders and squad leaders take your positions now My shoulder is jostled as someone walks by pushing between Rhiannon and me Others follow suit until there are about fifty people in front of us spaced out in formation Sections and squads I whisper to Rhiannon in case she didnt grow up in a military family Three squads in each section and three sections in each of the four wings Thank you Rhiannon answers Dain stands in the section for Second Wing facing me but averting his eyes First Squad Claw Section First Wing Nyra calls out A man closer to the dais raises his hand Cadets when your name is called take up formation behind your squad leader Nyra instructs The redhead with the crossbow and roll steps forward and begins calling names One by one cadets move from the crowd to the formation and I keep count making snap judgments based off clothing and arrogance It looks like each squad will have about fifteen or sixteen people in it Jack is called into the Flame Section of First Wing Tara is called into the Tail Section and soon they start on Second Wing I let loose a thankful sigh when the wingleader steps forward and it isnt Xaden Rhiannon and I are both called to Second Squad Flame Section Second Wing We get into formation quickly lining up in a square A quick glance tells me that we have a squad leaderDain who isnt looking at mea female executive squad leader four riders who look like they might be second or thirdyears and nine firstyears One of the riders with two stars on her uniform and halfshaved halfpink hair has a rebellion relic that winds around her forearm from her wrist to above her elbow where it disappears under her uniform but I look away so she wont catch me staring Were silent as the rest of the wings are called The sun is out in full now beating into my leathers and scorching my skin I told him not to keep you in that library Moms words from this morning haunt me but its not like I could have prepared for this I have exactly two shades when it comes to the sun pale and burned When the order sounds we all turn to face the dais I try to keep my gaze on the rollkeeper but my eyes jerk right like the traitors they are and my pulse leaps Xaden watches me with a cold calculating look that feels like hes plotting my death from where he stands as the wingleader for Fourth Wing I lift my chin He cocks his scarred eyebrow Then he says something to Second Wings wingleader and then every wingleader joins in on whats obviously a heated discussion What do you think theyre talking about Rhiannon whispers Quiet Dain hisses My spine stiffens I cant expect him to be my Dain here not under these circumstances but still the tone is jarring Finally the wingleaders turn around to face us and the slight tilt to Xadens lips makes me instantly queasy Dain Aetos you and your squad will switch with Aura Beinhavens Nyra orders Wait What Who is Aura Beinhaven Dain nods then turns to us Follow me He says it once then strides through formation leaving us to scurry after him We pass another squad on the way fromfrom The very breath freezes in my lungs Were moving to Fourth Wing Xadens wing It takes a minute maybe two and we take our place in the new formation I force myself to breathe Theres a fucking smirk on Xadens arrogant handsome face Im now entirely at his mercy a subordinate in his chain of command He can punish me however he likes for the slightest infraction even imaginary ones Nyra looks at Xaden as she finishes assignments and he nods stepping forward and finally breaking our staring contest Im pretty sure he won considering my heart is galloping like a runaway horse Youre all cadets now Xadens voice carries out over the courtyard stronger than the others Take a look at your squad These are the only people guaranteed by Codex not to kill you But just because they cant end your life doesnt mean others wont You want a dragon Earn one Most of the others cheer but I keep my mouth shut Sixtyseven people fell or died in some other way today Sixtyseven just like Dylan whose parents would either collect their bodies or watch them be buried at the foot of the mountain under a simple stone I cant force myself to cheer for their loss Xadens eyes find mine and my stomach clenches before he looks away And I bet you feel pretty badass right now dont you firstyears More cheers You feel invincible after the parapet dont you Xaden shouts You think youre untouchable Youre on the way to becoming the elite The few The chosen Another round of cheers goes up with each declaration louder and louder No Thats not just cheering its the sound of wings beating the air into submission Oh gods theyre beautiful Rhiannon whispers at my side as they come into viewa riot of dragons Ive spent my life around dragons but always from a distance They dont tolerate humans they havent chosen But these eight Theyre flying straight for usat speed Just when I think theyre about to fly overhead they pitch vertically whip the air with their huge semitranslucent wings and stop the gusts of wingmade wind so powerful that I nearly stagger backward as they land on the outer semicircular wall Their chest scales ripple with movement and their razorsharp talons dig into the edge of the wall on either side Now I understand why the walls are ten feet thick Its not a barrier The edge of the fortress is a damned perch My mouth drops open In my five years of living here Ive never seen this but then again Ive never been allowed to watch what happens on Conscription Day A few cadets scream Guess everyone wants to be a dragon rider until theyre actually twenty feet away from one Steam blasts my face as the navyblue one directly in front of me exhales through its wide nostrils Its glistening blue horns rise above its head in an elegant lethal sweep and its wings flare momentarily before tucking in the tip of their top joint crowned by a single fierce talon Their tails are just as fatal but I cant see them at this angle or even tell which breed of dragon each is without that clue All are deadly Were going to have to bring the masons in again Dain mutters as chunks of rock crumble under the dragons grips crashing to the courtyard in boulders the size of my torso There are three dragons in various shades of red two shades of greenlike Teine Miras dragonone brown like Moms one orange and the enormous navy one ahead of me Theyre all massive overshadowing the structure of the citadel as they narrow their golden eyes at us in absolute judgment If they didnt need us puny humans to develop signet abilities from bonding and weave the protective wards they power around Navarre Im pretty sure theyd eat us all and be done But they like protecting the Valethe valley behind Basgiath the dragons call homefrom merciless gryphons and we like living so here we are in the most unlikely of partnerships My heart threatens to beat out of my chest and I absolutely agree with it because Id like to run too Just thinking that Im supposed to ride one of these is fucking ludicrous A cadet bolts out of Third Wing screaming as he makes a run for the stone keep behind us We all turn to look as he sprints for the giant arched door at the center I can almost see the words carved into the arch from here but I already know them by heart A dragon without its rider is a tragedy A rider without their dragon is dead Once bonded riders cant live without their dragons but most dragons can live just fine after us Its why they choose carefully so theyre not humiliated by picking a coward not that a dragon would ever admit to making a mistake The red dragon on the left opens its vast mouth revealing teeth as big as I am That jaw could crush me if it wanted like a grape Fire erupts along its tongue then shoots outward in a macabre blaze toward the fleeing cadet Hes a pile of ash on the gravel before he can even make it to the shadow of the keep Sixtyeight dead Heat from the flames blasts the side of my face as I jerk my attention forward If anyone else runs and is likewise executed I dont want to see it More screaming sounds around me I lock my jaw as hard as I can to keep quiet There are two more gusts of heat one to my left and then another to my right Make that seventy The navy dragon seems to tilt its head at me as if its narrowed golden eyes can see straight through me to the fear fisting my stomach and the doubt curled insidiously around my heart I bet it can even see the wrap binding my knee It knows Im at a disadvantage that Im too small to climb its foreleg and mount too frail to ride Dragons always know But I will not run I wouldnt be standing here if Id quit every time something seemed impossible to overcome I will not die today The words repeat in my head just like they had before the parapet and on it I force my shoulders back and lift my chin The dragon blinks which might be a sign of approval or boredom and looks away Anyone else feel like changing their mind Xaden shouts scanning the remaining rows of cadets with the same shrewd gaze of the navyblue dragon behind him No Excellent Roughly half of you will be dead by this time next summer The formation is silent except for a few untimely sobs from my left A third of you again the year after that and the same your last year No one cares who your mommy or daddy is here Even King Tauris second son died during his Threshing So tell me again Do you feel invincible now that youve made it into the Riders Quadrant Untouchable Elite No one cheers Another blast of heat rushesthis time directly at my faceand every muscle in my body clenches preparing for incineration But its not flamesjust steam and it blows back Rhiannons braids as the dragons finish their simultaneous exhale The breeches on the firstyear ahead of me darken the color spreading down his legs They want us scared Mission accomplished Because youre not untouchable or special to them Xaden points toward the navy dragon and leans forward slightly like hes letting us in on a secret as we lock eyes To them youre just the prey The sparring ring is where riders are made or broken After all no respectable dragon would choose a rider who can not defend themselves and no respectable cadet would allow such a threat to the wing to continue training Major Afendras Guide to the Riders Quadrant Unauthorized Edition CHAPTER FOUR Elena Sosa Brayden Blackburn Captain Fitzgibbons reads from the death roll flanked by two other scribes on the dais as we stand in silent formation in the courtyard squinting into the early sun This morning were all in rider black and theres a single silver fourpointed star on my collarbone the mark of a firstyear and a Fourth Wing patch on my shoulder We were issued standard uniforms yesterday summerweight tightfitted tunics pants and accessories after Parapet was over but not flight leathers Theres no point handing out the thicker more protective combat uniforms when half of us wont be around come Threshing in October The armored corset Mira made me isnt regulation but I fit right in among the hundreds of modified uniforms around me After the last twentyfour hours and one night in the firstfloor barracks Im starting to realize that this quadrant is a strange mix of wemightdietomorrow hedonism and brutal efficiency in the name of the same reason Jace Sutherland Captain Fitzgibbons continues to read and the scribes next to him shift their weight Dougal Luperco I think were somewhere in the fifties but I lost count when he read Dylans name a few minutes ago This is the only memorial the names will get the only time theyll be spoken of in the citadel so I try to concentrate to commit each name to memory but theres just too many My skin is agitated from wearing the armor all night like Mira suggested and my knee aches but I resist the urge to bend down and adjust the wrap I managed to put on in the nonexistent privacy of my bunk in the firstyear barracks before anyone else woke up There are a hundred and fiftysix of us in the first floor of the dormitory building our beds positioned in four neat rows in the open space Even though Jack Barlowe was put in the thirdfloor dorms Im not about to let any of them see my weaknesses Not until I know who I can trust Private rooms are like flight leathersyou dont get one until you survive Threshing Simone Casteneda Captain Fitzgibbons closes the scroll We commend their souls to Malek The god of death I blink Guess we were closer to the end than I thought Theres no formal conclusion to the formation no last moment of silence The names on the scroll leave the dais with the scribes and the quiet is broken as the squad leaders all turn and begin to address their squads Hopefully you all ate breakfast because youre not going to get another chance before lunch Dain says his eyes meeting mine for the span of a heartbeat before he glances away feigning indifference Hes good at pretending he doesnt know you Rhiannon whispers at my side He is I reply just as softly A smile tugs at the corners of my mouth but I keep my expression as bland as possible as I soak in the sight of him The sun plays in his sandybrown hair and when he turns his head I see a scar peeking from his beard along his chin Id somehow missed yesterday Second and thirdyears Im assuming you know where to go Dain continues as the scribes wind their way around the edge of the courtyard to my right headed back to their quadrant I ignore the tiny voice inside me protesting that it was supposed to be my quadrant Lingering on what could have been isnt going to help me survive to see tomorrows sunrise Theres a mutter of agreement from the senior cadets ahead of us As firstyears were in the back two rows of the little square that makes up Second Squad Firstyears at least one of you should have memorized your academic schedule when it was handed out yesterday Dains voice booms over us and its hard to reconcile this sternfaced serious leader with the funny grinning guy Ive always known Stick together I expect you all to be alive when we meet this afternoon in the sparring gym Fuck Id almost forgotten that were sparring today We only have the gym twice a week so as long as I can get through todays session unscathed Im in the clear for another couple of days At least I have some time to get my feet under me before well have to handle the Gauntletthe terrifying vertical obstacle course they told us well have to master when the leaves turn colors in two months If we can complete the final Gauntlet well walk through the natural box canyon above it that leads to the flight field for Presentation where this years dragons willing to bond will get their first look at the remaining cadets Two days after that Threshing will occur in the valley beneath the citadel I glance around at my new squadmates and cant help but wonder which of us if any will make it to that flight field let alone that valley Dont borrow tomorrows trouble And if were not the smartass firstyear behind me asks I dont bother looking but Rhiannon does rolling her eyes as she turns back forward Then I wont have to be concerned with learning your name since it will be read off tomorrow morning Dain answers with a shrug A secondyear ahead of me snorts a laugh the movement jangling two small hoop earrings in her left lobe but the pinkhaired one stays silent Sawyer Dain looks at the firstyear to my left Ill get them there The tall wiry cadet whose light complexion is covered with a smattering of freckles answers with a tight nod His freckled jaw ticks and my chest pangs with sympathy Hes one of the repeatsa cadet who didnt bond during Threshing and now has to start the entire year over Get going Dain orders and our squad breaks apart around the same time the others do transforming the courtyard from an orderly formation to a crowd of chatting cadets The second and thirdyears walk off in another direction including Dain We have about twenty minutes to get to class Sawyer shouts at the eight of us firstyears Fourth floor second room on the left in the academic wing Get your shit and dont be late He doesnt bother waiting to confirm weve heard him before he heads off toward the dormitory That has to be hard Rhiannon says as we follow the crowd toward the dorms Being set back and having to do this all over again Better than being dead the smartass says as he passes us on the right his darkbrown hair flopping against the brown skin of his forehead with every step the shorter cadet takes His name is Ridoc if I remember correctly from the brief introductions we went through before dinner last night Thats true I reply as we head into the bottleneck thats formed at the door I overheard a thirdyear say when a firstyear survives Threshing unbonded the quadrant lets them repeat the year and try again if they want Rhiannon adds and I cant help but wonder how much determination it would take to survive your first year and then be willing to repeat it just for the chance you might one day become a rider You could just as easily die the second time around A bird whistles to the left and I look over the crowd my heart leaping because I immediately recognize the tone Dain The call sounds again and I narrow it down to somewhere near the door to the rotunda Hes standing at the top of the wide staircase and the second our eyes lock he motions toward the door with a subtle nod Ill be I start saying to Rhiannon but shes already followed my line of sight Ill grab your stuff and meet you there Its under your bunk right she asks You dont mind Your bunk is next to mine Violet Its not a hassle Go She gives me a conspiratorial smile and shoulder bumps me Thank you I smile quickly then wade across the crowd until I break free at the edge Lucky for me there arent many cadets headed into commons which means there arent any eyes on me once I slip inside one of the four giant doors of the rotunda My lungs pull in a sharp breath It looks like the renderings Ive seen in the Archives but there is no drawing no artistic medium that can capture just how overwhelming the space is how exquisite every detail The rotunda might be the most beautiful piece of architecture not only in the citadel but in all of Basgiath The room is three stories tall from its polished marble floors to the domed glass ceiling that filters in the soft morning light To the left are two massive arched doors to the academic wing echoed by the same on the right leading to the dorms and up a half dozen steps there are four doorways in front of me that open into the gathering hall Equally spaced around the rotunda shimmering in their various colors of red green brown orange blue and black stand six daunting marble pillars carved into dragons as if theyd come crashing down from the ceiling above Theres enough room between the snarling mouths at the base of each to fit at least four squads in the center but its empty right now I pass by the first dragon chiseled from darkred marble and a hand grips my elbow pulling me back behind the pillar where theres a gap between the claw and the wall Its just me Dains voice is low and quiet as he turns me to face him Tension radiates from every line of his frame I figured since you were the one birdcalling me I grin shaking my head Hes been using that signal since we were kids living near the Krovlan border while our parents were stationed there with the Southern Wing His brow furrows as his gaze scans over me no doubt looking for new injuries We only have a few minutes before this place is packed How is your knee It hurts but Ill live Ive had far worse injuries and we both know it but theres no use telling him to relax when hes obviously not going to No one tried to screw with you last night Concern creases his forehead and I fold my arms to keep from smoothing the lines with my fingers His worry sits on my chest like a stone Would it be so bad if they did I tease forcing my smile to widen He drops his arms to his sides and sighs so hard the sound echoes in the rotunda You know thats not what I mean Violet No one tried to kill me last night Dain or even hurt me I lean back against the wall and take some weight off my knee Pretty sure we were all too tired and relieved to be alive to start slaughtering one another The barracks fell quiet pretty quickly after lights out There was something to be said for the emotional exhaustion of the day And you ate right I know they usher you out of the dorms fast when the bells chime for six I ate with the rest of the firstyears and before you even think about lecturing me I rewrapped my knee under my covers and had my hair braided before the bells sounded Ive been keeping scribe hours for years Dain Theyre up an hour earlier It makes me want to volunteer for breakfast duty actually He glances at the tight silvertipped braid Ive pinned into a bun against the darker hair near the crown of my head You should cut it Dont start with me I shake my head Theres a reason women keep it short here Vi The second someone gets ahold of your hair in the sparring ring My hair is the least of my concerns in the sparring ring I retort His eyes widen Im just trying to keep you safe Youre lucky I didnt shove you into Captain Fitzgibbonss hands this morning and beg him to take you out of here I ignore the bluster of a threat Were wasting time and theres one piece of information I need from Dain Why was our squad moved from Second Wing to Fourth yesterday He stiffens and looks away Tell me I need to know if Im reading into a situation that doesnt exist Fuck he mutters ripping his hand over his hair Xaden Riorson wants you dead Its common knowledge among the leadership cadre after yesterday Nope Not overreacting He moved the squad so he has a direct line to me So he can do whatever he wants and no one will question a thing Im his revenge against my mother My heart doesnt even jump at the confirmation of what I already knew Thats what I thought I just needed to be sure my imagination wasnt running away with me Im not going to let anything happen to you Dain steps forward and cups my face his thumb stroking over my cheekbone in a soothing motion Theres not much you can do I push off the wall stepping out of his reach I have to get to class Already there are a few voices echoing in the rotunda as cadets pass through His jaw works for a second and the lines are back between his eyebrows Just do your best to keep a low profile especially when were in Battle Brief Not like the colors in your hair dont give you away but thats the one class the entire quadrant takes Ill see if one of the secondyears can stand guard No one is going to assassinate me during history I roll my eyes Academics are the one place I dont have to worry What is Xaden going to do Pull me out of class and run me through with a sword in the middle of the hallway Or do you honestly think hell stab me in the middle of Battle Brief I wouldnt put it past him Hes fucking ruthless Violet Why do you think his dragon chose him The navyblue one who landed behind the dais yesterday My stomach twists The way those golden eyes assessed me Dain nods Sgaeyl is a Blue Daggertail and shesvicious He swallows Dont get me wrong Cath is a nasty piece of work when he gets riledall Red Swordtails arebut even most dragons steer clear of Sgaeyl I stare at Dain at the scar that defines his jaw and the hard set of his eyes that are familiar and yet not What he asks The voices around us grow louder and there are more footsteps coming and going You bonded a dragon You have powers I dont even know about You open doors with magic Youre a squad leader I say the sentences slowly hoping theyll sink in that Ill truly grasp how much hes changed Its just hard to wrap my head around you still beingDain Im still me His posture softens and he lifts the short sleeve of his tunic revealing the relic of a red dragon on his shoulder I just have this now And as for the powers Cath channels a pretty significant amount of magic compared to some of the other dragons but Im nowhere near adept at it yet I havent changed that much As for lesser magic powered through the bond of my relic I can do the typical stuff like open doors crank up my speed and power ink pens instead of using those inconvenient quills Whats your signet power Every rider can do lesser magic once their dragon begins channeling power to them but the signet is the unique ability that stands out the strongest skill that results from each unique bond between dragon and rider Some riders have the same signets Fire wielding ice wielding and water wielding are just a few of the most common signet powers all useful in battle Then there are the signets that make a rider extraordinary My mother can wield the power of storms Melgren can see the outcome of battles I cant help but wonder again what Xadens signet isand if hell use it to kill me when I least expect it I can read a persons recent memories Dain admits quietly Not like an inntinnsic reads minds or anythingI have to put my hands on the person so Im not a security risk But my signets not common knowledge I think theyll use me in intelligence He points to the compass patch beneath his Fourth Wing one on his shoulder Wearing that sigil indicates that a signet is too classified I just didnt notice it yesterday No way I smile taking a calming breath as I remember Xadens uniform didnt have any patches on it He nods an excited smile shaping his mouth Im still learning and of course Im better at it the closer I am to Cath but yeah I just put my hands on someones temples and I can see what they saw Itsincredible That signet will more than set Dain apart It will make him one of the most valuable interrogation tools we have And you say you havent changed I half tease This place can warp almost everything about a person Vi It cuts away the bullshit and the niceties revealing whoever you are at your core They want it that way They want it to sever your previous bonds so your loyalty is to your wing Its one of the many reasons that firstyears arent allowed to correspond with their family and friends otherwise you know I would have written you But a year doesnt change that I still think of you as my best friend Im still Dain and this time next year you will still be Violet We will still be us If Im still alive I joke as the bells ring I have to get to class Yeah and Im going to be late to the flight field He motions toward the edge of the pillar Look Riorson is still a wingleader Hell be after you but hell find a way to do it within the rules of the Codex at least when people are watching I was His cheeks flush Really good friends with Amber Mavisthe current wingleader for Third Winglast year and Im telling you the Codex is sacred to them Now you go first Ill see you in the sparring gym He smiles reassuringly Ill see you I smile back and turn on my heel walking around the base of the massive pillar into the semicrowded rotunda Therere a couple dozen cadets in here walking from one building to another and it takes a second to get my bearings I spot the academic doors between the orangeandblack pillars and start that way blending into the crowd The hairs on the back of my neck stand up and a chill races down my spine as I cross the center of the rotunda then my steps halt Cadets move around me but my eyes are drawn upward toward the top of the steps that lead to the gathering hall Oh shit Xaden Riorson is watching me with narrowed eyes the sleeves of his uniform rolled up his massive arms that remain folded across his chest the warning in his reliccovered arm on full display as a thirdyear next to him says something that he blatantly ignores My heart jumps and lodges in my throat Theres maybe twenty feet between us My fingers twitch ready to grab one of the blades sheathed at my ribs Is this where hell do it In the middle of the rotunda The marble floor is gray so it shouldnt be that hard for the staff to get the blood out His head tilts and he studies me with those impossibly dark eyes like hes deciding where Im most vulnerable I should run right But at least I can see him coming if I hold this position His attention shifts glancing to my right and he lifts a single brow at me My stomach pitches as Dain emerges from behind the pillar What are you Dain starts as he reaches me his brow furrowed in confusion Top of the steps Fourth door I hiss interrupting him Dains gaze snaps up as the crowd thins out around us and he mutters a curse notsosubtly stepping closer to me Fewer people mean fewer witnesses but Im not foolish enough to think Xaden wont kill me in front of the whole quadrant if he wants I already knew your parents are tight Xaden calls out a cruel smile tilting his lips But do you two have to be so fucking obvious The few cadets who are still in the rotunda turn to look at us Let me guess Xaden continues glancing between Dain and me Childhood friends First loves even He cant hurt you without cause right I whisper Without cause and calling a quorum of wingleaders because youre a squad leader Article Four Section Three Correct Dain answers not bothering to lower his voice But youre not I expected you to do a better job of hiding where your affections lie Aetos Xaden moves walking down the steps Shit Shit Shit Run Violet Dain orders me Now I bolt Knowing I am in direct disagreement with General Melgrens orders I am officially objecting to the plan set forth in todays briefing It is not this generals opinion that the children of the rebellions leaders should be forced to witness their parents executions No child should watch their parent put to death The Tyrrish Rebellion an official brief for King Tauri by General Lilith Sorrengail CHAPTER FIVE Welcome to your first Battle Brief Professor Devera says from the recessed floor of the enormous lecture hall later in the morning a bright purple Flame Section patch on her shoulder matching her short hair perfectly This is the only class held in the circular tiered room that curves the entire end of the academic hall and one of only two rooms in the citadel capable of fitting every cadet Every creaky wooden seat is full and the senior thirdyears are standing against the walls behind us but we all fit Its a far cry from history last hour where there were only three squads of firstyears but at least the firstyears in our squad are all seated together Now if I could only remember all their names Ridoc is easy to rememberhe cracked wiseass comments all through history Hopefully he knows better than to try the same in here though Professor Devera isnt the joking kind In the past riders have seldom been called into service before graduation Professor Devera continues her mouth tensing as she paces slowly in front of a twentyfoothigh map of the Continent mounted to the back wall thats intricately labeled with our defensive outposts along our borders Dozens of mage lights illuminate the space more than making up for the lack of windows and reflecting off the longsword she keeps strapped to her back And if they were they were always thirdyears whod spent time shadowing forward wings but we expect you to graduate with the full knowledge of what were up against Its not about just knowing where every wing is stationed either She takes her time making eye contact with every firstyear she sees The rank on her shoulder says captain but I know shell be a major before she leaves her rotation teaching here given the medals pinned on her chest You need to understand the politics of our enemies the strategies of defending our outposts from constant attack and have a thorough knowledge of both recent and current battles If you can not grasp these basic topics then you have no business on the back of a dragon She arches a black brow a few shades darker than her deepbrown skin No pressure Rhiannon mutters at my side furiously taking notes Well be fine I promise her in a whisper Thirdyears have only been sent to midland posts as reinforcements never the front Id kept my ears open around my mother enough to know that much This is the only class you will have every day because its the only class that will matter if youre called into service early Professor Deveras gaze sweeps from left to right and pauses on me Her eyes flare wide for a heartbeat but she gives an approving smile and nod before moving on Because this class is taught every day and relies on the most current information you will also answer to Professor Markham who deserves nothing but your utmost respect She waves the scribe forward and he moves to stand next to her the cream color of his uniform contrasting with her stark black one He leans in when she whispers something to him and his thick eyebrows fly high as he whips his head in my direction Theres no approving smile when the colonels weary eyes find mine only a sigh that fills my chest with heavy sorrow when I hear it I was supposed to be his star pupil in the Scribe Quadrant his crowning achievement before he retires How absolutely ironic that Im now the least likely to succeed in this one It is the duty of the scribes not only to study and master the past but to relay and record the present he says rubbing the bridge of his bulbous nose after finally tearing his disappointed gaze from mine Without accurate depictions of our front lines reliable information with which to make strategic decisions andmost importantlyveracious details to document our history for the good of future generations were doomed not only as a kingdom but as a society Which is exactly why Ive always wanted to be a scribe Not that it matters now First topic of the day Professor Devera moves toward the map and flicks her hand bringing a mage light directly over the eastern border with the Poromiel province of Braevick The Eastern Wing experienced an attack last night near the village of Chakir by a drift of Braevi gryphons and riders Oh shit A murmur rips through the hall and I dip my quill into the inkpot on the desk in front of me so I can take notes I cant wait to channel so I can use the type of coveted pens Mom keeps on her desk A smile curves my lips There could definitely be perks to being a rider There will be Naturally some information is redacted for security purposes but what we can tell you is that the wards faltered along the top of the Esben Mountains Professor Devera pulls her hands apart and the light expands illuminating the mountains that form our border with Braevick Allowing the drift not only to enter Navarrian territory but for their riders to channel and wield sometime around midnight My stomach sinks as a murmur rises from the cadets especially the firstyears Dragons arent the only animals capable of channeling powers to their riders Gryphons from Poromiel also share the ability but dragons are the only ones capable of powering the wards that make all other magic but their own impossible within our borders Theyre the reason Navarres borders are somewhat circulartheir power radiates from the Vale and can only extend so far even with squads stationed at every outpost Without those wards were fucked It would be open season on Navarrian villages when the raiding parties from Poromiel inevitably descend Those greedy assholes are never content with the resources they have They always want ours too and until they learn to be content with our trade agreements we have no chance of ending conscription in Navarre No chance of experiencing peace But if were not on high alert then they must have gotten the wards rewoven or at least stabilized Thirtyseven civilians were killed in the attack in the hour before a squad from the Eastern Wing could arrive but the riders and dragons managed to repel the drift Professor Devera finishes folding her arms over her chest Based on that information what questions would you ask She holds up a finger I only want answers from firstyears to start My initial question would be why the hell the wards faltered but its not like theyre going to answer a question like that in a room full of cadets with zero security clearance I study the map The Esben Mountain Range is the highest along our eastern border with Braevick making it the least likely place for an attack especially since gryphons dont tolerate altitude nearly as well as dragons probably due to the fact that theyre halflion halfeagle and cant handle the thinner air at higher altitudes Theres a reason weve been able to fend off every major assault on our territory for the last six hundred years and weve successfully defended our land in this neverending fourhundredyearlong war Our abilities both lesser and signet are superior because our dragons can channel more power than gryphons So why attack in that mountain range What caused the wards to falter there Come on firstyears show me you have more than just good balance Show me you have the criticalthinking skills to be here Professor Devera demands Its more important than ever that youre ready for whats beyond our borders Is this the first time the wards have faltered a firstyear a couple of rows ahead asks Professors Devera and Markham share a look before she turns toward the cadet No My heart jolts into my throat and the room falls pindrop quiet Its not the first time The girl clears her throat And howoften are they faltering Professor Markhams shrewd eyes narrow on her Thats above your pay grade cadet He turns his attention to our section Next relevant question to the attack were discussing How many casualties did the wing suffer a firstyear down the row to my right asks One injured dragon One dead rider Another murmur rises from the hall Surviving graduation doesnt mean well survive service Statistically most riders die before retirement age especially at the rate riders have been falling over the last two years Why would you ask that particular question Professor Devera asks the cadet To know how many reinforcements theyll need he answers Professor Devera nods turning toward Pryor the meekest firstyear in our squad who has his hand up but he lowers it quickly scrunching his dark eyebrows Did you want to ask a question Yes He nods sending a few locks of black hair into his eyes then shakes his head No Never mind So decisive Lucathe catty firstyear in our squad Ill do just about anything to avoidmocks from next to him tilting her head as cadets laugh around them A corner of her mouth tilts up into a smirk and she flips her long brown hair over her shoulder in a move thats anything but casual Like me shes one of the few women in the quadrant who didnt cut her hair I envy her confidence that it wont be used against her but not her attitude and Ive known her less than a day Hes in our squad Aurelieat least I think thats her namechastises her nononsense black eyes narrowing on Luca Show some loyalty Please No dragon is bonding to a guy who cant even decide if he wants to ask a question And did you see him at breakfast this morning He held the entire line up because he couldnt choose between bacon or sausage Luca rolls her kohlrimmed eyes If Fourth Wing is done picking at one another Professor Devera asks lifting a brow Ask what altitude the village is at I whisper to Rhiannon What Her brow furrows Just ask I reply trying to keep Dains advice in mind I swear I can feel him staring at the back of my neck from seven rows behind me but Im not going to turn and look not when I know Xadens up there somewhere too What altitude is the village at Rhiannon asks Professor Deveras eyebrows rise as she turns to Rhiannon Markham A little less than ten thousand feet he answers Why Rhiannon darts a dose of sideeye at me and clears her throat Just seems a little high for a planned attack with gryphons Good job I whisper It is a little high for a planned attack Devera says Why dont you tell me why thats bothersome Cadet Sorrengail And maybe youd like to ask your own questions from here on out She levels a stare on me that has me squirming in my seat Every head in the room turns in my direction If anyone had an inkling of doubt about who I am its long gone now Awesome Gryphons arent as strong at that altitude and neither is their ability to channel I say Its an illogical place for them to attack unless they knew the wards would fail especially since the village looks to be about whatan hours flight from the nearest outpost I glance at the map to be sure Im not making a fool of myself That is Chakir right there isnt it Scribes training for the win It is A corner of Professor Deveras mouth lifts into a smirk Keep going with that line of thought Wait a second Didnt you say it took an hour for the squad of riders to arrive My gaze narrows I did She looks at me with expectation Then they were already on their way I blurt immediately recognizing how silly that sounds My cheeks heat as a mumble of laughter sounds around me Yeah because that makes sense Jack turns around in his seat from the front row and openly laughs at me General Melgren knows the outcome of a battle before it happens but even he doesnt know when it will happen dumbass I feel the chuckling of my classmates reverberate in my bones I want to crawl under this ridiculous desk and disappear Fuck off Barlowe Rhiannon snaps Im not the one who thinks precognition is a thing he retorts with a sneer Gods help us if that one ever gets on the back of a dragon Another round of laughter has my neck flaming too Why do you think that Violet Professor Markham winces Cadet Sorrengail Because theres no logical way they get there within an hour of the attack unless they were already on their way I argue shooting a glare at Jack Fuck him and his laughter I might be weaker than he is but Im a hell of a lot smarter It would take at least half that long to light the beacons in the range and call for help and no full squad is sitting around just waiting to be needed More than half those riders would have been asleep which means they were already on their way And why would they already be on their way Professor Devera prods and the light in her eyes tells me Im right giving me the confidence to take my train of thought a step further Because they somehow knew the wards were breaking I lift my chin simultaneously hoping Im right and praying to Dunnethe goddess of warthat Im wrong Thats the most Jack starts Shes right Professor Devera interrupts and a hush falls over the room One of the dragons in the wing sensed the faltering ward and the wing flew Had they not the casualties would have been far higher and the destruction of the village much worse A little bubble of confidence rises in my chest which is promptly popped by Jacks glare telling me he hasnt forgotten his promise to kill me Second and thirdyears take over Professor Devera orders Lets see if you can be a little more respectful to your fellow cadets She arches a brow at Jack as questions begin to fire off from the riders behind us How many riders were deployed to the site What killed the lone fatality How long did it take to clear the village of the gryphons Were any left alive for questioning I write down every question and answer my mind organizing the facts into what kind of report I would have filed if Id been in the Scribe Quadrant which information was important enough to include and what was extraneous What was the condition of the village a deep voice asks from the back of the lecture hall The hairs on my neck rise my body recognizing the imminent threat behind me Riorson Markham asks shielding his eyes from the mage lights as he looks toward the top of the hall The village Xaden restates Professor Devera said the damage would have been worse but what was the actual condition Was it burned Destroyed They wouldnt demolish it if they were trying to establish a foothold so the condition of the village matters when trying to determine a motive for the attack Professor Devera smiles in approval The buildings theyd already gone through were burned and the rest were being looted when the wing arrived They were looking for something Xaden says with complete conviction And it wasnt riches Thats not a gem mining district Which begs the question what do we have that they want so badly Exactly Thats the question Professor Devera glances around the room And that right there is why Riorson is a wingleader You need more than strength and courage to be a good rider So whats the answer a firstyear to the left asks We dont know Professor Devera answers with a shrug Its just another piece in the puzzle of why our constant bids for peace are rejected by the kingdom of Poromiel What were they looking for Why that village Were they responsible for the collapse of the ward or was it already faltering Tomorrow next week next month there will be another attack and maybe well get another clue Go to history if youre looking for answers Those wars have already been dissected and examined Battle Brief is for fluid situations In this class we want you to learn which questions to ask so all of you have a chance at coming home alive Something in her tone tells me its not just thirdyears who might be called into service this year and a chill settles in my bones You seriously knew every answer in history and apparently every right question to ask in Battle Brief Rhiannon says shaking her head as we stand on the sidelines of the sparring mat after lunch watching Ridoc and Aurelie circle each other in their fighting leathers Theyre evenly matched in size Ridoc is on the smaller side and Aurelie is built just like Mira which doesnt surprise me because shes a legacy on her fathers side Youre not even going to have to study for tests are you The rest of the firstyears stand on our side but the second and thirdyears line the others Theyre definitely at an advantage here considering theyve already had at least a year of combat training I was trained to be a scribe I shrug and the vest Mira made me shimmers slightly with the movement Other than the times the scales catch the light under the camouflaging mesh it fits right in with the tops wed been given from central issue yesterday All the women are dressed similarly now though the cuts of their leathers are chosen by preference The guys are mostly shirtless because they think shirts give their opponent something to grab onto Personally Im not arguing with their logic just enjoying the viewrespectfully of course which means keeping my eyes on my own squads mat and off the other twenty mats in the massive gym that consumes the first floor of the academic wing One wall is made entirely of windows and doors all left open to let in the breeze but its still stiflingly hot Sweat trickles down my spine under my vest There are three squads from each wing here this afternoon and lucky me First Wing has sent their third squads which include Jack Barlowe whos been glaring at me from two mats over since I walked in Guess that means youre not worried about academics Rhiannon says her brows rising at me Shes chosen a leather vest too but hers cuts in above the collarbone and secures at her neck leaving her shoulders bare for movement Stop circling each other like youre dance partners and attack Professor Emetterio orders from across the mat where Dain watches Aurelie and Ridocs match with our squad executive leader Cianna Thank God Dains shirt is on because I dont need another distraction when its time for my turn Im worried about this I tell Rhiannon tilting my chin toward the mat Really She shoots me a skeptical look Her braids are twisted into a small bun at the nape of her neck I figured as a Sorrengail youd be a handtohand threat Not exactly At my age Mira had been training in handtohand for twelve years I have a whopping six months under my belt which wouldnt matter as much if I wasnt as breakable as a porcelain teacup but here we are Ridoc launches toward Aurelie but she ducks sweeping out her leg and tripping him He staggers but doesnt go down He pivots quickly palming a dagger in his hand No blades today Professor Emetterio bellows from beside the mat Hes only the fourth professor Ive met but hes definitely the one who intimidates me most Or maybe its just the subject he teaches that has me envisioning his compact frame as giant Were just assessing Ridoc grumbles and sheathes his knife just in time to deflect a right hook from Aurelie The brunette packs a punch Rhiannon says with an appreciative smile before glancing my way What about you I ask as Ridoc lands a jab to Aurelies ribs Shit He shakes his head and backs up a step I dont want to hurt you Aurelie holds her ribs but lifts her chin Who said you hurt me Pulling your punches does her a disservice Dain says folding his arms The Cygnis on the northeast border arent going to give her any quarter because shes a woman if she falls from her dragon behind enemy lines Ridoc Theyll kill her just the same Lets go Aurelie shouts beckoning Ridoc by curling her fingers Its obvious that most cadets have trained their whole lives to enter the quadrant especially Aurelie who slips a jab from Ridoc and twists to land a quick tap to his kidneys Ouch I meandamn Rhiannon mutters giving Aurelie another look before turning back to me Im pretty good on the mat My village is on the Cygnisen border so we all learned to defend ourselves fairly young Physics and math arent problems either But history She shakes her head That class might be the death of me They dont kill you for failing history I say as Ridoc charges Aurelie taking her to the mat with enough force to make me wince Im probably going to die on these mats She hooks her legs around his and somehow leverages him over until shes the one on top landing punch after punch to the side of his face Blood spatters the mat I could probably offer some tips to survive combat training Sawyer says from Rhiannons other side running his hand over a days growth of brown stubble that doesnt quite cover his freckles History isnt my strongest subject though A tooth goes flying and bile rises in my throat Enough Professor Emetterio shouts Aurelie rolls off Ridoc and stands touching her fingers to her split lip and examining the blood then offers her hand to help him up He takes it Cianna take Aurelie to the healers No reason to lose a tooth during assessment Emetterio orders Ill make you a deal Rhiannon says locking her brown eyes with mine Lets help each other out Well help you with handtohand if you help us with history Sound like a deal Sawyer Absolutely Deal I swallow as one of the thirdyears wipes down the mat with a towel But I think Im getting the better end of that You havent seen me try to memorize dates Rhiannon jokes A couple of mats over someone shrieks and we all turn to look Jack Barlowe has another firstyear in a headlock The other guy is smaller thinner than Jack but still has a good fifty pounds on me Jack yanks his arms his hands still secure around the other mans head That guy is such an ass Rhiannon starts The sickening crack of bones breaking sounds across the gym and the firstyear goes limp in Jacks hold Sweet Malek I whisper as Jack drops the man to the ground Im starting to wonder if the god of death lives here for how often his name must be invoked My lunch threatens to reappear but I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth since its not like I can shove my head between my knees here What did I say their instructor shouts as he charges onto the mat You broke his damned neck How was I supposed to know his neck was that weak Jack argues Youre dead Sorrengail and Im going to be the one to kill you His promise from yesterday slithers through my memory Eyes forward Emetterio orders but his tone is kinder than it has been as we all look away from the dead firstyear You dont have to get used to it he tells us But you do have to function through it You and you He points to Rhiannon and another firstyear in our squad a man with a stocky build blueblack hair and angular features Shit I cant remember his name Trevor Thomas maybe There are too many new people to remember who is who at this point I glance at Dain but hes watching the pair as they take the mat Rhiannon makes quick work of the firstyear stunning me every time she dodges a punch and lands one of her own Shes fast and her hits are powerful the kind of lethal combination that will set her apart just like Mira Do you yield she asks the firstyear guy when she takes him to his back her hand stopped midhit just above his throat Tanner Im pretty sure its something that starts with a T No he shouts hooking his legs around Rhiannons and slamming her to her back But she rolls and quickly gains her feet before putting him in the same position again this time with her boot to his neck I dont know Tynan you might want to yield Dain says with a grin Shes handing you your ass Ah thats right Tynan Fuck off Aetos Tynan snaps but Rhiannon presses her boot into his throat garbling the last word He turns a mottled shade of red Yeah Tynan has more ego than common sense He yields Emetterio calls out and Rhiannon steps back offering her hand Tynan takes it You Emetterio points to the pinkhaired secondyear with the rebellion relic And you His finger swings to me Shes at least a head taller than me and if the rest of her body is as toned as her arms then Im pretty much fucked I cant let her get her hands on me My heart threatens to beat out of my chest but I nod and step onto the mat Youve got this Rhiannon says tapping my shoulder as she passes me Sorrengail The pinkhaired girl looks me over like Im something shes scraped off the side of her boot narrowing her pale green eyes You really should dye your hair if you dont want everyone to know who your mother is Youre the only silverhaired freak in the quadrant Never said I cared if everyone knows who my mother is I circle the secondyear on the mat I am proud of her service to protect our kingdomfrom enemies both without and within As her jaw tightens at the dig a bubble of hope rises in my chest Marked ones as Id heard some people this morning refer to those carrying rebellion relics on their arms blame my mother for the execution of their parents Fine Hate me Mom often says the minute you let emotion enter a fight youve already lost Ive never prayed harder that my iceinherveins mother was right You bitch she seethes Your mother murdered my family She lunges forward and swings wildly and I quickly sidestep spinning away with my hands up We do that for a few more rounds and I land a few jabs start to think that my plan might just work She growls low in her throat as she misses me again and her foot flies at my head I easily duck but then she drops to the ground and kicks out with her other foot which lands square in my chest sending me backward I hit the mat with a thud and shes already above me so damn fast You cant use your powers in here Imogen Dain shouts Imogen is trying her best to kill me Her eyes are above mine and I feel the quick slide of something hard against my ribs as she smiles at me But her smile fades as we both look down and I cant help but notice a dagger being resheathed The armor just saved my life Thank you Mira Confusion mars Imogens face for just a second long enough for me to send my fist into her cheek and roll out from under her My hand screams with pain even though Im sure I formed the fist right but I block it out as we both gain our feet What kind of armor is that she asks staring at my ribs as we circle each other Mine I duck and dodge as she comes at me again but her movements are a blur Imogen Emetterio shouts Do it again and Ill I swerve the wrong way this time and she catches me taking me to the floor The mat smacks my face and her knee digs into my back as she pulls my right arm behind me Yield she shouts I cant If I yield on the first day what will the second bring No Now Im the one lacking common sense like Tynan and Im far more breakable She pulls my arm farther and pain consumes every thought blackening the edges of my vision I cry out as the ligaments stretch shred then pop Yield Violet Dain yells Yield Imogen demands Gasping for breath against the weight of her on my back I turn my face to the side as she wrenches my shoulder apart the pain consuming me She yields Emetterio says Thats enough I hear it againthe macabre sound of snapping bonebut this time its mine It is my opinion that of all the signet powers riders provide mending is the most precious but we can not allow ourselves to become complacent when in the company of such a signet For menders are rare and the wounded are not Major Fredericks Modern Guide for Healers CHAPTER SIX Flames of agony engulf my upper arm and chest as Dain carries me through the lower covered passage out of the Riders Quadrant over the ravine and into the Healer Quadrant Its basically a stone bridge covered and sided with more stone which pretty much makes it a suspended tunnel with a few windows but Im not thinking clearly enough to take it in as we rush through his strides eating up the distance Almost there he reassures me his grip firm but careful on my rib cage and beneath my knees as my useless arm rests on my chest Everyone saw you lose it I whisper doing my best to mentally block the pain like I have countless times before Its usually as easy as building a mental wall around the pulsing torment in my body then telling myself the pain only exists in that box so I cant feel it but it isnt working so well this time I didnt lose it He kicks the door three times when we reach it You shouted and carried me out of there like I mean something to you I focus on the scar on his jaw the stubble on his tan skin anything to keep from feeling the utter destruction in my shoulder You do mean something to me He kicks again And now everyone knows The door swings open and Winifred a healer who has been at my side too many times to mention stands back so Dain can carry me in Another injury You riders certainly are trying to fill our beds to Oh no Violet Her eyes fly wide Hi Winifred I manage over the pain This way She leads us into the infirmary a long hall of beds half of which are full of people in rider black Healers do not have magic relying on traditional tinctures and medical training to heal as best they can but menders do Hopefully Nolons around tonight since hes been mending me for the last five years The signet of mending is exceptionally rare among riders They have the power to fix to restore to return anything to its original statefrom ripped cloth to pulverized bridges including broken human bones My brother Brennan was a menderand would have become one of the greatest had he lived Dain gently lays me onto the bed Winifred brings us to then she leans into the edge of the mattress near my hip Every creased line in her face is a comfort as she strokes a weathered hand across my forehead Helen go get Nolon Winifred orders a healer in her forties walking by No Dain barks panic lacing his tone Excuse me The middleaged healer glances between Dain and Winifred clearly torn Helen this is Violet Sorrengail and if Nolon finds out she was here and you didnt call him wellthats on you Winifred says in a deceptively calm tenor Sorrengail the healer repeats her voice rising I try to focus on Dain through the throbbing in my shoulder but the room is starting to spin I want to ask him why wouldnt he want my shoulder mended but another wave of pain threatens to pull me into unconsciousness and all I can do is moan Get Nolon or he will let his dragon eat you alive sour face and all Helen Winifred arches a silver eyebrow as she ignores Dain insisting again not to call the mender The woman blanches and disappears Dain pulls a wooden chair closer to my bed and it scrapes the floor with a godawful sound Violet I know youre hurting but maybe Maybe what Dain Aetos You want to see her suffer Winifred lectures I told her theyd break you she mutters as she leans over me her gray eyes full of worry as she assesses me Winifred is the best healer Basgiath has and she prepares every tonic she prescribes herselfand has seen me through more scrapes than I care to count over the years Would she listen to me Absolutely not Your mother is so damned stubborn She reaches for my injured arm and I wince as she raises it a couple of inches prods my shoulder Well thats certainly broken Winifred tsks raising her brows at the sight of my arm And it looks like we need a surgeon for that shoulder What happened she asks Dain Sparring I explain in one word You hush Save your energy Winifred looks back at Dain Make yourself useful boy and pull the curtain around us The fewer people who see her injured the better He jumps to his feet and quickly complies drawing the blue fabric around us to make a small but effective room separating us from the other riders who have been brought in Drink this Winifred brings out a vial of amber liquid from her belt It will handle the pain while we get you sorted You cant ask him to mend her Dain protests as she uncorks the glass The pair of us have been mending her for the past five years she lectures bringing the vial closer Dont start telling me what I can and can not do Dain slides one hand under my back the other under my head helping me slightly upright so I can get the liquid down Its bitter like always as I swallow but I know it will do the trick He settles me back on the bed and turns to Winifred I dont want her in painthats why were here But if shes injured this severely surely we can see if the scribes will take her as a late admission Its only been a day As his reasoning for not wanting a mender sinks in my anger is able to pierce through the pain long enough for me to bite out Im not going to the scribes Then I sigh closing my eyes as a pleasant hum races through my veins Soon theres enough distance between me and the pain to think somewhat clearly as I force my eyes open again At least I think its soon but theres a conversation going on I clearly havent been paying attention to so its obviously been a few minutes The curtain whips back and Nolon walks in leaning heavily on his cane He smiles at his wife his bright white teeth contrasting his brown skin You sent for me my His smile falters as he sees me Violet Hi Nolon I force my mouth to curve upward Id wave butone ofmyarms doesnt workand theother feels realllllyheavy Good gods am I slurring my words Leigheas serum Winifred offers her husband a crooked smile Shes with you Dain Nolon turns an accusing look on Dain and I feel all of fifteen years old again being hauled in because I broke my ankle while we were climbing somewhere we shouldnt have been Im her squad leader Dain replies scooting out of Nolons way so the mender can get closer Putting her under my command was the only thing I could think of to keep her safe Not doing such a good job are you Nolons eyes narrow It was assessment day for handtohand Dain explains Imogenshes a secondyeardislocated Violets shoulder and broke her arm On assessment day Nolon growls cutting away the fabric of my shortsleeve shirt with his dagger The man is eightyfour if hes a day and he still dresses in rider black sheathed with all his weapons Hermotherwasssss OneofFennnnRiorsons seppparaseppparasssseparatisssts I explain slowly trying to enunciate and failing And ImmmmmaSorrengail so I getit I dont Nolon grumbles Ive never agreed with the way they conscripted those kids to the Riders Quadrant as punishment for the sins of their parents We have never forced conscripts into that quadrant Ever And for a very good reason Most cadets dont survivewhich was likely the point I suspect Regardless you certainly shouldnt have to suffer for the honor of your mother General Sorrengail saved Navarre by capturing the Great Betrayer So you wont mend her right Dain asks softly so he cant be heard outside the curtain Im just asking that the healers do their work and let nature take the time it needs No magic She doesnt stand a chance if she goes back in there in a cast or has to defend herself while her shoulder heals from reconstruction surgery The last one took her four months This is our chance to get her out of the Riders Quadrant while shes still breathing Imnotgoingtothesibes So much for not slurring Sibes I try again SIBES Oh fuck it Mendme I will always mend you Nolon promises Just This Once I concentrate on every word If The others See I need Mending Allthetime theyll Think Im weak Which is why we have to use this opportunity to get you out Panic rises in Dains voice and my heart sinks He cant protect me from everything and watching me break watching me eventually die is going to ruin him Walking out of here and going straight to the Scribe Quadrant is your best chance at survival I glare at Dain and choose my words carefully Im not Leavingtheriders Just so Mom Canthrowmeback Im Staying I turn my head and the room spins as I look for Nolon Mend mebut justthisonce You know its going to hurt like hell and will still ache for a couple of weeks right Nolon asks sitting down in the chair beside my bed and staring at my shoulder I nod This isnt my first mending When youre as brittle as I was born the pain of mending is only second to the pain of the original injury Basically another Tuesday Please Vi Dain begs quietly Please switch quadrants If not for you then for mebecause I didnt step in fast enough I should have stopped her I cant protect you I wish Id figured out his plan before taking Winifreds potion so I could have explained better None of this is his fault but hes going to shoulder the blame just like he always does Instead I take a deep breath and say I made mychoice Get back to the quadrant Dain Nolon orders without looking up If she was any other firstyear you would already be gone Dains anguished gaze holds mine and I insist Go Ill findyouat formmmmation inthe morning I dont want him to see this anyway He swallows the defeat and nods once then turns and walks through the separation in the curtains without another word I sincerely hope my choice today doesnt end up destroying my best friend later Ready Nolon asks his hands hovering above my shoulder Bite down Winifred holds a strap of leather in front of my mouth and I take it between my teeth Here we go Nolon mutters lifting his hands over my shoulder His brow furrows in concentration before he makes a twisting motion Whitehot agony erupts in my shoulder My teeth slice into the leather as I scream bearing down for one heartbeat then two before blacking out The barracks are nearly full by the time I make my way back later that night my throbbing right arm cradled in a lightblue sling that makes me an even bigger target if thats possible Slings say weak They say breakable They say liability to the wing If I break this easily on the mat whats going to happen if I get on the back of a dragon The sun has long since gone down but the hall is lit by the soft glow of mage lights as the other firstyear women get ready for bed I offer a smile to a girl whos holding a bloodspeckled cloth to her swollen lip and she returns it with a wince I count three empty bunks in our row but that doesnt mean those cadets are dead right They could be in the Healer Quadrant just like I was or maybe theyre in the bathing chambers Youre here Rhiannon jumps off her bed already dressed in her sleeping shorts and top relief in her eyes and smile as she sees me Im here I assure her Im already down one shirt but Im here You can get another at central issue tomorrow She looks like she might hug me but glances at my sling and backs up a step sitting on the edge of her bunk as I do the same with mine facing her How bad is it Its going to hurt for the next few days but Ill be fine as long as I keep it immobilized Ill be all healed up before we start onmat challenges I have two weeks to figure out how to keep this from happening again Ill help you get ready she promises Youre the only friend I have in here so Id rather you didnt die when it gets real A corner of her mouth lifts in a wry smile Ill try my best not to I grin through the throbbing ache in my shoulder and arm The tonic has long since worn off and its starting to hurt like hell And Ill help you with history I brace my weight on my left hand and it slides just beneath my pillow Theres something there Well be unstoppable Rhiannon declares her gaze tracking Tara the darkhaired curvy girl from Morraine as she walks past our bunks I pull out a small bookno its a journalwith a folded note on top that says Violet in Miras handwriting Onehanded I open the note Violet I stayed long enough to read the rolls this morning and you arent on them thank gods I cant stay Im needed back with my wing and even if I could stay they wouldnt let me see you anyway I bribed a scribe to sneak this into your bunk I hope you know how proud I am to be your sister Brennan wrote this for me the summer before I entered the quadrant It saved me and it can save you too I added my own bits of hardearned wisdom here and there but mostly its his and I know hed want you to have it Hed want you to live Love Mira I swallow past the knot in my throat and set the note aside What is it Rhiannon asks Its my brothers The words barely make it past my lips as I open the cover Mother burned everything he owned after he died as tradition dictates Its been ages since Ive seen the bold strokes of his handwriting and yet there they are My chest tightens and a fresh wave of grief sweeps through me The book of Brennan I read along with the first page and then flip to the second Mira Youre a Sorrengail so you will survive Perhaps not as spectacularly as I have but we all cant live up to my standards can we All kidding aside this is everything Ive learned Keep it safe Keep it hidden You have to live because Violet is watching You cant let her see you fall Brennan Tears prick my eyes but I blink them back Its just his journal I lie thumbing through the pages I can hear his quippy sarcastic tone as I skim over his words as though hes standing here making light of every danger with a wink and a grin Damn I miss him He died five years ago Oh thats Rhiannon leans in her eyes heavy with sympathy We dont always burn everything either Sometimes its nice to have something you know Yeah I whisper Its everything to have this and yet I know Mom will toss it in the fire if she ever finds it Rhiannon sits back on her bed opening her history book and I fall back into Brennans history starting on the third page You survived Parapet Good Be observant the next few days and dont do anything to draw attention to yourself Ive sketched a map that shows you not only where the classrooms are but where the instructors meet too I know youre nervous about challenges but you shouldnt be not with that right hook of yours The matches might seem random but theyre not What the instructors dont tell you is that they decide challenges the week before Mira Any cadet can request a challenge yes but instructors will assign your matches based on weeding out the weakest That means once the real handtohand starts the instructors already know who youll be up against that day Heres the secretif you know where to look and can get out without being seen youll know who youre fighting so you can prepare I suck in a breath and devour the rest of the entry hope blossoming in my chest If I know who Im fighting then I can begin the battle before we even step on the mat My mind spins a plan taking shape Two weeks thats how long I have to get everything Ill need before challenges begin and no one knows the grounds of Basgiath like I do Its all here A slow smile spreads across my face I know how to survive In the best interest of preserving peace within Navarre no more than three cadets carrying rebellion relics may be assigned to any squad of any quadrant Addendum 52 Basgiath War College Code of Conduct In addition to last years changes marked ones assembling in groups of three or more will now be considered an act of seditious conspiracy and is hereby a capital offense Addendum 53 Basgiath War College Code of Conduct CHAPTER SEVEN Damn it I mutter as my toe catches a rock and I stumble in the waisthigh grass that grows alongside the river beneath the citadel The moon is nice and full illuminating my way but it means Im sweating to death in this cloak to keep hidden just in case anyone else is out here wandering after curfew The Iakobos River rushes with summer runoff from the peaks above and the currents are fast and deadly this time of year especially coming out of the steep drop of the ravine No wonder that firstyear died when he fell in yesterday during our downtime Since Parapet our squad is the only one in the quadrant not to lose anyone but I know thats unlikely to last much longer in this ruthless school Tightening my heavy satchel over my sling I move closer to the river along the ancient line of oaks where I know one vine of fonilee berries will be coming into season soon Ripe the purple berries are tart and barely edible but picked prematurely and left to dry will make an excellent weapon in the growing arsenal that nine nights of sneaking out has given me This was exactly the reason I brought the book of poisons with me Challenges start next week and I need every possible advantage Spotting the boulder Ive used as a landmark for the past five years I count the trees on the riverbank One two three I whisper spotting the exact oak Ill need Its branches spread wide and high some even daring to reach out over the river Lucky for me the lowest is easily climbable even more so with the grass oddly trampled underneath A twinge of pain shoots up through my shoulder as I slip my right arm out of the sling and begin to climb by moonlight and memory The pain quickly fades to an ache just like it has every evening while Rhiannon has been kicking my ass on the mat Hopefully tomorrow Nolon will let me out of the annoying sling for good The fonilee vine looks deceptively like ivy as it winds up the trunk but Ive scaled this particular tree enough times to know this is the one Ive just never had to climb the damn thing in a cloak before Its a pain in my ass The fabric catches on almost every branch as I move upward slowly and steadily climbing past the wide branch where I used to spend hours reading Shit My foot slips on the bark and my heart stutters for a heartbeat while my feet find better holds This would be so much easier during the day but I cant risk being caught Bark scrapes my palms as I climb higher The tips of the vine leaves are white at this height barely visible in the mottled moonlight through the canopy but I grin as I find exactly what Ive been searching for There you are The purple berries are a gorgeous unripe lavender Perfect Digging my fingernails into the branch above me I manage to keep from wobbling long enough to retrieve an empty vial in my satchel and uncork it with my teeth Then I pluck just enough berries off the vine to fill the glass and shove the stopper back in Between these the mushrooms Ive already hunted tonight and the other items Ive collected I should be able to make it through the next month of challenges Im almost down the tree only a handful of branches to go when I spot movement beneath me and pause Hopefully its just a deer But its not Two figures in black cloaksapparently tonights disguise of choicewalk under the protection of the tree The smaller one leans back against the lowest limb removing her hood to reveal a halfshaved head of pink hair I know all too well Imogen the squadmate who nearly ripped off my arm ten days ago My stomach tightens then knots as the second rider slips off his own hood Xaden Riorson Oh shit Theres maybe fifteen feet between us and nothingand no oneout here to stop him from killing me Fear clenches my throat and holds tight as I whiteknuckle the branches around me debating the merits of holding my breath so he cant hear me versus falling out of the tree if I faint from lack of oxygen They begin speaking but I cant hear what theyre saying not with the river rushing by Relief fills my lungs If I cant hear them they cant hear me either as long as I sit tight But all it takes is for him to look up and Ill be toast literally if he decides to feed me to that Blue Daggertail of his The moonlight I was thankful for a few minutes ago has now become my biggest liability Slowly carefully quietly I move out of the patchy moonlight to the next branch over cloaking myself in shadow What is he doing out here with Imogen Are they lovers Friends Its absolutely none of my business and yet I cant help but wonder if shes the kind of woman he goes forone whose beauty is only outmatched by her brutality They fucking deserve each other Xaden turns away from the river as though hes looking for someone and sure enough more riders arrive gathering under the tree Theyre all dressed in black cloaks as they shake hands And they all have rebellion relics My eyes widen as I count There are almost two dozen of them a few thirdyears and a couple of seconds but the rest are all firsts I know the rules Marked ones cant gather in groups larger than three Theyre committing a capital offense simply by being together Its obviously a meeting of some sort and I feel like a cat clinging to the leaftipped limbs of this tree while the wolves circle below Their gathering could be completely harmless right Maybe theyre homesick like when the cadets from the Morraine province all spend a Saturday at the nearby lake just because it reminds them of the ocean they miss so much Or maybe marked ones are plotting to burn Basgiath to the ground and finish what their parents started I can sit up here and ignore them but my complacencymy fearcould get people killed if theyre down there scheming Telling Dain is the right thing to do but I cant even hear what theyre saying Shit Shit Shit Nausea churns in my stomach I have to get closer Keeping myself on the opposite side of the trunk and sticking to the shadows that wrap around me I climb down another branch with slothlike speed holding my breath as I test each branch with a fraction of my weight before lowering myself Their voices are still muffled by the river but I can hear the loudest of them a tall darkhaired man with pale skin whose shoulders take up twice the space of any firstyear standing opposite Xadens position and wearing the rank of a thirdyear Weve already lost Sutherland and Luperco he says but I cant make out the response It takes two more rungs of branches before their words are clear My heart pounds like its trying to escape my ribs Im close enough for any one of them to see if they look hard enoughwell everyone except Xaden since his back is turned toward me Like it or not were going to have to stick together if you want to survive until graduation Imogen says One little hop to the right and I could repay that callous shoulder maneuver she pulled on me with a quick kick to her head I just happen to value my own life more than I want revenge at the moment so I keep my feet to myself And if they find out were meeting a firstyear girl with an olive complexion asks her eyes darting around the circle Weve done this for two years and theyve never found out Xaden responds folding his arms and leaning back against the limb below my right Theyre not going to unless one of you tells And if you tell Ill know The threat is obvious in his tone Like Garrick said weve already lost two firstyears to their own negligence There are only fortyone of us in the Riders Quadrant and we dont want to lose any of you but we will if you dont help yourselves The odds are always stacked against us and trust me every other Navarrian in the quadrant will look for reasons to call you a traitor or force you to fail Theres a muttered assent and my breath hitches at the intensity in his voice Damn it I dont want to find a single thing about Xaden Riorson admirable and yet here he is being all annoyingly admirable Asshole Have to admit it would be nice if a highranking rider from my province gave a shit if the rest of us from the province lived or died How many of you are getting your asses handed to you in handtohand Xaden asks Four hands shoot into the air none of which belong to the spikyblondhaired firstyear standing with his arms crossed a head taller than most others Liam Mairi Hes in Second Squad Tail Section of our wing and already the top cadet in our year He practically ran across the parapet and destroyed every opponent on assessment day Shit Xaden swears and I would give anything to see his expression as he lifts a hand to his face The big oneGarricksighs Ill teach them I recognize him now Hes the Flame Section leader in Fourth Wing My direct superior above Dain Xaden shakes his head Youre our best fighter Youre our best fighter a secondyear near Xaden counters with a quick grin Hes handsome with tawny brown skin crowned by a cloud of black curls and a litany of patches on what I can see of his uniform under his cloak His features are close enough to Xadens that they might be related Cousins maybe Fen Riorson had a sister if I remember correctly Shit what was the guys name Its been years since I read the records but I think it started with a B Dirtiest fighter maybe Imogen snarks Most everyone laughs and even the firstyears crack a smile Fucking ruthless is more like it Garrick adds Theres a general consensus of nods including one from Liam Mairi Garrick is our best fighter but Imogen is right up there with him and shes a hell of a lot more patient Xaden notes which is just ludicrous considering she didnt seem too patient while breaking my arm So the four of you split yourselves up between the two of them for training A group of three wont draw any unwanted attention What else is giving you trouble I cant do this a gangly firstyear says rolling his shoulders inward and lifting his slim fingers to his face What do you mean Xaden asks his voice taking on a hard edge I cant do this The smaller one shakes his head The death The fighting Any of it The pitch of his voice rises with every statement A guy had his neck snapped right in front of me on assessment day I want to go home Can you help me with that Every head swings toward Xaden No Xaden shrugs Youre not going to make it Best accept it now and not take up more of my time Its all I can do to smother my gasp and some of the others in the group dont bother trying What A Dick The smaller guy looks stricken and I cant help but feel bad for him That was a little harsh cousin the secondyear who looks a little like Xaden says lifting his eyebrows What do you want me to say Bodhi Xaden cocks his head to the side his voice calm and even I cant save everyone especially not someone who isnt willing to work to save themselves Damn Xaden Garrick rubs the bridge of his nose Way to give a pep talk If they need a fucking pep talk then we both know theyre not flying out of the quadrant on graduation day Lets get real I can hold their hands and make them a bunch of bullshit empty promises about everyone making it through if that helps them sleep but in my experience the truth is far more valuable He turns his head and I can only assume hes looking at the panicked firstyear In war people die Its not glorious like the bards sing about either Its snapped necks and twohundredfoot falls Theres nothing romantic about scorched earth or the scent of sulfur Thishe gestures back toward the citadelisnt some fable where everyone makes it out alive Its hard cold uncaring reality Not everyone here is going to make it hometo whatevers left of our homes And make no mistake we are at war every time we step foot in the quadrant He leans forward slightly So if you wont get your shit together and fight to live then no Youre not going to make it Only crickets dare to break the silence Now someone give me a problem I can actually solve Xaden orders Battle Brief a firstyear I recognize says softly Her bunk is only a row away from Rhiannons and mine Shitwhats her name There are too many women in the hall to know everyone but Im certain shes in Third Wing Its not that I cant keep up but the information She shrugs Thats a tough one Imogen responds turning to look at Xaden Her profile in the moonlight is almost unrecognizable as the same person who shredded my shoulder That Imogen is cruel vicious even But the way shes looking at Xaden softens her eyes her mouth her whole posture as she tucks a short strand of pink hair behind her ear You learn what they teach you Xaden says to the firstyear his voice taking a hard edge Keep what you know but recite whatever they tell you to My brow furrows What the hell does he mean by that Battle Brief is one of the classes taught by scribes to keep the quadrant uptodate on all nonclassified troop movements and battle lines The only things were asked to recite are recent events and general knowledge of whats going on near the front lines Anyone else Xaden asks Youd better ask now We dont have all night It hits me thenother than being gathered in a group of more than three theres nothing wrong with what theyre doing here Theres no plot no coup no danger Its just a group of older riders counseling firstyears from their province But if Dain knew hed be honor bound to When do we get to kill Violet Sorrengail a guy toward the back asks My blood turns to ice The murmur of assent among the group sends a jolt of terror down my spine Yeah Xaden Imogen says sweetly lifting her pale green eyes to him When do we get to finally have our revenge He turns just enough for me to see his profile and the scar that crosses his face as he narrows his eyes at Imogen I told you already the youngest Sorrengail is mine and Ill handle her when the time is right Hellhandle me My muscles thaw with the heat of indignation Im not some inconvenience to be handled My shortlived admiration of Xaden is over Didnt you already learn that lesson Imogen the lookalike Xaden chides from halfway down the circle What I hear Aetos has you scrubbing dinner dishes for the next month for using your powers on the mat Imogens head snaps in his direction Her mother is responsible for the execution of my mom and sister I should have done more than just snap her shoulder Her mom is responsible for the capture of nearly all our parents Garrick counters folding his arms over his wide chest Not her daughter Punishing children for the sins of their parents is the Navarrian way not the Tyrrish So we get conscripted because of what our parents did years ago and shoved into this death sentence of a college Imogen starts In case you didnt notice shes in the same death sentence of a college Garrick retorts Seems like shes already suffering the same fate Am I seriously watching them debate over whether I should be punished for being Lilith Sorrengails daughter Dont forget her brother was Brennan Sorrengail Xaden adds She has just as much reason to hate us as we do her He pointedly looks at Imogen and the firstyear who raised the question And Im not going to tell you again Shes mine to handle Anyone feel like arguing Silence reigns Good Then get back to bed and go in threes He motions with his head and they slowly disperse walking away in groups of threes just like he ordered Xaden is the last to leave I draw a slow breath Holy shit I just might live through this But I have to be sure theyre gone I dont move a muscle even when my thighs cramp and my fingers lock as I count to five hundred in my head breathing as evenly as possible to soften the beats of my galloping heart Only when Im sure Im alone when the squirrels scurry past on the ground do I finish climbing from the tree jumping the last four feet to the grassy floor Zihnal must have a soft spot for me because Im the luckiest woman on the Continent A shadow lunges behind me and I open my mouth to scream but my air supply is cut off by an elbow around my neck as Im yanked against a hard chest Scream and you die he whispers and my stomach plummets as the elbow is replaced by the sharp bite of a dagger at my throat I freeze Id recognize the rough pitch of Xadens voice anywhere Fucking Sorrengail His hand yanks back the hood of my cloak How did you know My tone is outright indignant but whatever If hes going to kill me Im not going down as some simpering little beggar Let me guess you could smell my perfume Isnt that what always gives the heroine away in books He scoffs I command shadows but sure it was your perfume that gave you away He lowers the knife and steps away I gasp Your signet is a shadow wielder No wonder hes risen so high in rank Shadow wielders are incredibly rare and highly coveted in battle able to disorient entire drifts of gryphons if not take them down depending upon the signets strength What Aetos hasnt warned you not to get caught alone in the dark with me yet His voice is like rough velvet along my skin and I shiver then draw my own blade from the sheath at my thigh and raise it as I spin toward him ready to defend myself to the death Is this how you plan to handle me Eavesdropping were we He arches a black brow and sheathes his dagger like I couldnt possibly pose a threat to him which only serves to piss me off even more Now I might actually have to kill you Theres an undertone of truth in those mocking eyes This is justbullshit Then go ahead and get it over with I unsheathe another dagger this one from beneath my cloak where it was strapped in at my ribs and back up a couple of feet to give me distance to throw themif he doesnt rush me He pointedly looks at one dagger then the other and sighs folding his arms across his chest That stance is really the best defense you can muster No wonder Imogen nearly ripped your arm off Im more dangerous than you think I flatout bluster So I see Im quaking in my boots The corner of his mouth rises into a mocking smirk Fucking Asshole I flip the daggers in my hand pinching them at the tips then flick my wrists and fire them past his head one on each side They land solidly in the trunk of the tree behind him You missed He doesnt even flinch Did I I reach for my last two blades Why dont you back up a couple of steps and test that theory Curiosity flares in his eyes but its gone in the next second masked by cold mocking indifference Every one of my senses is on high alert but the shadows around me dont slide in as he moves backward his eyes locked with mine His back hits the tree and the hilts of my daggers brush his ears Tell me again that I missed I threaten taking the dagger in my right hand by the tip Fascinating You look all frail and breakable but youre really a violent little thing arent you An appreciative smile curves his perfect lips as shadows dance up the trunk of the oak taking the form of fingers They pluck the daggers from the tree and bring them to Xadens waiting hands My breath abandons me with a sharp exhale He has the kind of power that could end me without him having to so much as lift a finger shadow wielding The futility of even trying to defend myself against him is laughable I hate how beautiful he is how lethal his abilities make him as he strides toward me shadows curling around his footsteps Hes like one of those poisonous flowers Ive read about from the Cygnis forests to the east His allure is a warning not to get too close and I am definitely too close Switching my grip to the hilts of my daggers I prepare for the attack You should show that little trick to Jack Barlowe Xaden says turning his palms upward and offering me my daggers Im sorry This is a trick It has to be a trick He moves closer and I lift my blade My heart stumbles the beat irregular as fear floods my system The necksnapping firstyear whos very publicly vowed to slaughter you Xaden clarifies as my blade presses against his cloak at the level of his abdomen He reaches under my own cloak and slides one blade into the sheath at my thigh then pulls back the side of my cloak and pauses His gaze locks onto the length of my braid where it falls over my shoulder and I could swear he stops breathing for a heartbeat before he slides the remaining dagger into one of the sheaths at my ribs Hed probably think twice about plotting your murder if you threw a few daggers at his head This isthis isbizarre It has to be some kind of game meant to confuse me right And if so hes playing it really fucking well Because the honor of my murder belongs to you I challenge You wanted me dead long before your little club chose my tree to meet under so I imagine youve all but buried me in your mind by now He glances at the dagger poised at his stomach Do you plan on telling anyone about my little club His eyes meet mine and theres nothing but cold calculating death waiting there No I answer truthfully suppressing a shiver Why not He tilts his head to the side examining my face like Im an oddity Its illegal for the children of separatist officers to assemble in Groups larger than three Im well aware Ive lived at Basgiath longer than you I lift my chin And youre not going to run off to Mommy or your precious little Dain and tell them weve been assembling His gaze narrows on mine My stomach twists just like it did before I stepped out onto the parapet like my body knows that whatever action I take next will determine my lifespan You were helping them I dont see why that should be punished It wouldnt be fair to him or the others Was their little meeting illegal Absolutely Should they die for it Absolutely not And thats exactly what will happen if I tell Those firstyears will be executed for nothing more than asking for tutoring and the senior cadets will join them just because they helped Im not going to tell He looks at me like hes trying to see through me and ice prickles my scalp My hand is steady but my nerves tremble at what the next thirty seconds might bring He can kill me right here toss my body into the river and no one will know Im gone until they find me downstream But I wont let him end me without drawing his blood first thats for damn sure Interesting he says softly Well see if you keep your word and if you do then unfortunately it looks like I owe you a favor Then he steps away turns and walks off heading back toward the staircase in the cliff that leads up to the citadel Wait What Youre not going to handle me I call after him shock raising my brows Not tonight he tosses over his shoulder I scoff What are you waiting for Its no fun if you expect it he answers striding into the darkness Now get back to bed before your wingleader realizes youre out after curfew What I gawk after him Youre my wingleader But hes already disappeared into the shadows leaving me talking to myself like a fool He didnt even ask what was in my satchel A slow smile spreads across my face as I tuck my arm back into my sling sighing with relief as the weight is taken off my shoulder A fool with fonilee berries There is an art to poison not often discussed and that is timing Only a master can properly dose and administer for effective onset One must take into account the mass of the individual as well as the method of delivery Effective Uses of Wild and Cultivated Herbs by Captain Lawrence Medina CHAPTER EIGHT The womens hall is quiet as I dress for the morning the sun barely peeking above the horizon in the far windows I take the dragonscale vest from where I left it to dry on the hanger at the end of my bed and slip it on over my shortsleeve black shirt Its a good thing Ive gotten pretty adept at tightening the laces behind my back since Rhiannon isnt in her bed At least one of us is getting a few muchneeded orgasms Pretty sure theres a person or two scattered with their partners among the full bunks in here too The squad leaders talk a good game about enforcing curfew but no one really cares Well except Dain He cares about every rule Dain My chest tightens and I smile as I finish braiding my hair into a crown Seeing him is the best part of my day even the moments when hes anything but personable in public Even in the moments where hes consumed with trying to save me from this place I grab my bag on the way out passing by rows of empty beds that belonged to the dozen women who havent survived to see August and shove open the door There he is Dains eyes light up as he pushes off the wall of the hallway where hes obviously been waiting for me Morning I cant help the smile that curves my lips You dont have to escort me to duty every morning you know Its the only time I get to see you when Im not your squad leader he counters as we walk down the empty hallway past the halls that will lead to our rooms if we survive Threshing Trust me its worth getting up an hour early though I still cant figure out why youd choose breakfast duty over every other assignment I shrug I have my reasons Really really really good reasons Though I do miss the extra hour of sleep Id had before we chose our assignments last week A door on the right flies open and Dain darts in front of me dragging me behind him with his arm so I faceplant into his back He smells like leather and soap and Rhiannon he snaps Sorry Rhiannons eyes widen I slip out of Dains hold and move to his side so I can see her I wondered where you were this morning A grin spreads across my face as Tara appears next to her Hey Tara Hey Violet She gives me a wave then heads down the hallway tucking her shirt into her pants We have curfew for a reason cadet Dain lectures and I fight the urge to roll my eyes And you know that no one is supposed to be in the private dorms until after Threshing Maybe we were just up early Rhiannon counters You know like you are right now She glances between the two of us with a mischievous smirk Dain rubs the bridge of his nose Justget back to the dorms and pretend you slept there will you Absolutely She squeezes my hand as she passes by Way to go I whisper quickly Shes had a thing for Tara since we got here I know right She backs away with a smile then turns to push through the hall doors Monitoring the sex lives of firstyears was not what I had in mind when I applied to be a squad leader Dain mutters and we continue toward the kitchen Oh come on Like you werent a firstyear yourself last year He lifts his brows in thought and eventually shrugs Fair point And youre a firstyear now His eyes slide my way as we near the arched doorways that lead to the rotunda and his lips part like hes going to continue but he looks away pivoting to open the door for me Why Dain Aetos Are you asking me about my sex life I let my fingers trail along the exposed fangs of the green dragon pillar and bite back a smile as we walk by No He shakes his head then pauses in thought I meanis there a sex life to ask about We climb the steps that lead into commons and I turn just before the door to face him Hes two steps below me putting us at eye level Since I got here I tap my chin with my finger and smile Thats none of your business Before I got here Still none of your business Another fair point His mouth curves into a grin that makes me wish it was his business though I turn around before I do something utterly foolish like make it his business We continue into commons walking past the empty study tables and the entrance to the library Its nothing as aweinspiring as the scribes Archives but it has every tome Ill need for studying here Are you ready for today Dain asks as we near the gathering hall For the challenges to start this afternoon My stomach knots Ill be all right I assure him but he moves in front of me halting my steps I know youve been practicing with Rhiannon but Worry lines his forehead Ive got it I promise looking into his eyes so he knows I mean it You dont have to worry about me Last night Oren Seiferts name was posted next to mine right where Brennan said it would be Hes a tall blond in First Wing with tolerable knife skills but one hell of a punch I always worry about you Dains hands curl into fists Dont I shake my head I can handle myself I just dont want to see you get hurt again My ribs squeeze my heart like a vise Then dont watch I take his calloused hand in mine You cant save me from this Dain Im going to be challenged once a week just like every other cadet And its not going to stop there You cant protect me from Threshing or the Gauntlet or Jack Barlowe You need to lay low with that one Dain grimaces Avoid that pompous ass whenever you can Vi Dont give him an excuse to come after you Hes already responsible for too many names on the death roll Then the dragons are going to love him They always go for the vicious ones Dain squeezes my hand gently Just steer clear of him I blink The advice is so different from Xadens throwafewdaggersathishead approach Xaden The knot of guilt thats been lodged in my stomach since last week grows a fraction bigger By code I should tell Dain about seeing marked ones under the oak tree but I wont not because I told Xaden that I wouldnt but because keeping the secret feels like the right thing to do Ive never kept a secret from Dain in my life Violet Did you hear me Dain asks lifting a hand to cradle my face Jerking my gaze to his I nod and repeat Steer clear of Barlowe He drops his hand and shoves it into a pocket of his pants Hopefully hell forget all about his little vendetta against you Do most men forget when a woman holds a knife to their balls I cock an eyebrow at him No He sighs You know its not too late to sneak you down to the scribes Fitzgibbons will take you The bells ring marking quarter past five and saving me from another session of Dain begging me to run away to the Scribe Quadrant Ill be all right Ill see you at formation I give his hand a squeeze then walk away leaving him as I make my way to the kitchen Im always the first here and today is no exception I pocket the vial of dried powdered fonilee berries from my satchel and get started as the other workers come in sleepyeyed and grumbly The powder is nearly white nearly invisible as I take my place in the serving line an hour later and completely undetectable as I sprinkle it over Oren Seiferts scrambled eggs when he approaches Keep the temperaments of each specific breed in mind when you decide which dragons to approach and which to run from at Threshing Professor Kaori says his serious dark eyes slashing toward his nose as he studies the new recruits for a beat then he changes the projection hes conjured from a Green Daggertail to a Red Scorpiontail Hes an illusionist and the only professor in the quadrant with the signet ability to project what he sees in his mind which makes this class one of my favorites Hes also the reason I knew exactly what Oren Seifert looked like Do I feel guilty about blatantly misleading a professor about why I needed to find another cadet No Do I think its cheating Also no I was doing exactly what Mira suggested and using my brain The Red Scorpiontail in the center of our circled tables is a fraction of its actual size six feet tall at most but its an exact replica of the actual firebreather waiting in the Vale for Threshing Red Scorpiontails like Ghrian here are the quickest to temper Professor Kaori continues his perfectly trimmed mustache curving as he smiles at the illusion like hes the dragon himself We all take notes So if you offend him youre Lunch Ridoc says from my left and the class laughs Even Jack Barlowe who hasnt quit glaring at me since his squad took over their quarter of the room a half hour ago snorts Precisely Professor Kaori responds So whats the best way to approach a Red Scorpiontail He glances around the room I know the answer but I keep my hand to myself heeding Dains advice to lay low You dont Rhiannon mutters next to me and I huff a laugh under my breath They prefer that you approach from the left and from the front if possible a woman from one of the other squads answers Excellent Professor Kaori nods For this Threshing there are three Red Scorpiontails willing to bond The image changes in front of us to a different dragon How many dragons are there in total Rhiannon asks A hundred for this year Professor Kaori answers changing the image again But some might change their minds during Presentation in about two months depending on what they see My stomach hits the floor Thats thirtyseven fewer than last year Maybe even fewer if they dont like the look of us after we have to parade by them for their perusal two days before Threshing Then again theres usually fewer cadets after that particular event anyway Professor Kaoris dark eyebrows rise Yes Cadet Sorrengail it is and twentysix fewer than the year before that Fewer dragons are choosing to bond but the number of riders entering the quadrant has remained steady My mind whirls Attacks at the eastern borders are increasing according to every Battle Brief and yet there are fewer dragons willing to bond in order to defend Navarre Will they tell you why they wont bond another firstyear asks No jackass Jack scoffs his icyblue gaze narrowing on the cadet Dragons only talk to their bonded riders just like they only give their full name to their bonded rider You should know that by now Professor Kaori sends Jack a look that shuts the firstyears mouth but doesnt stop him from sneering at the other cadet They dont share their reasons our instructor says And anyone who respects their life wont ask a question theyre not willing to answer Do the numbers affect the wards Aurelie asks from where she sits behind me tapping her quill against the edge of her desk Shes never happy sitting still Professor Kaoris jaw ticks twice Were not sure The number of bonded dragons has never affected the integrity of Navarres wards before but Im not about to lie to you and say that were not seeing increased breaches when you know from Battle Brief that we are The wards are faltering at a rate that makes my stomach tense every time Professor Devera starts our daily Battle Brief Either were weakening or our enemies are getting stronger Both possibilities mean the cadets in this room are needed more than ever Even me The image changes to Sgaeyl the navyblue dragon bonded to Xaden My stomach pitches as I remember the way she looked right through me that first day You wont have to worry about how to approach blue dragons since there are none willing to bond this Threshing but you should be able to recognize Sgaeyl if you see her Professor Kaori says So you can fucking run Ridoc drawls I nod along while others laugh Shes a Blue Daggertail the rarest of the blues and yes if you see her without her bonded rider you shoulddefinitely find somewhere else to be Ruthless does not begin to describe her nor does she abide by what we assume to be what the dragons consider law She even bonded the relative of one of her previous riders which you all know is typically forbidden but Sgaeyl does whatever she wants whenever she wants In fact if you see any of the blues dont approach them Just Run Ridoc repeats raking his hand through his floppy brown hair Run Professor Kaori agrees with a smile the mustache above his top lip quivering slightly There are a handful of other blues in active service but youll find them all along the Esben Mountains in the east where the fighting is most intense Theyre all intimidating but Sgaeyl is the most powerful of them all My breath catches No wonder Xaden can wield shadowsshadows that can yank daggers out of trees shadows that can probably throw those same daggers And yethe let me live I shove the kernel of warmth that thought gives me far far away Probably just to screw with you a monster playing with his prey before pouncing What about the black dragon the firstyear next to Jack asks Theres one here right Jacks face lights up I want that one Not that its going to matter Professor Kaori flicks his wrist and Sgaeyl disappears and a massive black dragon takes her place Even the illusion is bigger making me crane my neck slightly to see its head But just to appease your curiosity since this is the only time youll ever see him here is the only other black besides General Melgrens Hes huge Rhiannon says And is that a clubtail No A morningstartail He has the same bludgeoning power of a clubtail but those spikes will eviscerate a person just as well as a daggertail Best of both worlds Jack calls out He looks like a killing machine He is Professor Kaori answers And honestly I havent seen him in the last five years so this image is more than a little outdated But since we have him up here what can you tell me about black dragons Theyre the smartest and most discerning Aurelie calls out Theyre the rarest I add in There hasnt been one born in the lastcentury Correct Professor Kaori spins the illusion again and Im met with a pair of glaring yellow eyes Theyre also the most cunning Theres no such thing as outsmarting a black dragon This one is a little over a hundred which makes him about middleaged Hes revered as a battle dragon among their kind and if not for him we probably would have lost during the Tyrrish rebellion Add to it that hes a morningstartail and hes one of the deadliest dragons in Navarre I bet he powers one hell of a signet How do you approach him Jack asks leaning forward in his seat Theres pure avarice in his eyes mirrored by his friend next to him Thats the last thing this kingdom needs someone as cruel as Jack bonding to a black dragon No thank you You dont Professor Kaori answers He hasnt agreed to bond since his previous and only rider was killed during the uprising and the only way youd ever be near him is if youre in the Vale which you wont be because youd be incinerated before you ever got through the gorge The pale redhead across the circle from me shifts in her seat and tugs her sleeve down to cover her rebellion relic Someone should ask him again Jack urges It doesnt work that way Barlowe Now there is only one other black dragon which is in service General Melgrens Sawyer says His book is closed in front of him but I cant blame him Id hardly be taking notes either if this was the second time Id gone through this class Codagh right Yes Professor Kaori nods The eldest of their den and a swordtail But just for curiositys sake Jacks glacialblue gaze doesnt stray from the illusion of the unbonded black dragon still being projected What signet ability would this guy gift his rider Professor Kaori closes his fist and the illusion disappears Theres no telling Signets are the result of the unique chemistry between rider and dragon and usually say more about the rider than the dragon The stronger the bond and the more powerful the dragon the stronger the signet Fine What was his previous riders Jack asks Naolins signet was siphoning Professor Kaoris shoulders fall He could absorb power from various sources other dragons other riders and then use it or redistribute it Badass Ridocs tone has more than a little hero worship He was Professor Kaori agrees What kills someone with that kind of signet Jack asks crossing his arms over his thick chest Professor Kaori glances at me for a heartbeat before looking away He attempted to use that power to revive a fallen riderwhich didnt work because theres no signet capable of resurrectionand depleted himself in the process To use a phrase youll become accustomed to after Threshing he burned out and died next to that rider Something in my chest shifts a feeling that I cant explain and yet cant shake The bells ring signaling the hour is up and we all begin to gather our things The squads filter out to the hallway emptying the room and I rise from behind my desk shouldering my satchel as Rhiannon waits for me by the door a puzzled expression on her face It was Brennan wasnt it I ask Professor Kaori Sadness fills his gaze as he meets mine Yes He died trying to save your brother but Brennan was too far gone Why would he do that I shift the weight of my satchel Resurrection isnt possible Why would he essentially kill himself when Brennan was already gone A stampede of grief tramples my heart stealing my breath Brennan never would have wanted anyone to die for him That wasnt in his nature Professor Kaori sits back against his desk pulling at the short dark hairs of his mustache as he stares at me Being a Sorrengail doesnt do you any favors in here does it I shake my head There are more than a few cadets who would like to take meand my last namedown a peg He nods It wont be like that once you leave After graduation youll find that being General Sorrengails daughter means others will do just about anything to keep you alive even pleased not because they love your mother but because they either fear her or want her favor Which was Naolin A little bit of both And sometimes its hard for a rider with a signet that powerful to accept his limits After all bonding makes you a rider but resurrecting someone from the dead Now that makes you a god I somehow dont think that Malek takes kindly to a mortal treading on his territory Thank you for answering I turn and start toward the door Violet Professor Kaori calls out and I pivot to look back I taught both your siblings A signet like mine is too useful here in the classroom to let me deploy with a wing for long Brennan was a spectacular rider and a good man Mira is shrewd and gifted in the seat when it comes to riding I nod But youre smarter than both of them I blink Its not often I get compared to my brother and sister and somehow come out on top From what Ive seen of you helping your friend study in commons every night it seems you might be more compassionate too Dont forget that Thank you but being smart and compassionate isnt going to help me when it comes to Threshing A selfdeprecating laugh escapes You know more about dragons than anyone else in the quadrant probably anyone else on the Continent They choose strength and shrewdness They choose for reasons they dont see fit to share with us He pushes off his desk And not all strength is physical Violet I nod because I cant find any appropriate words for his wellintentioned flattery and head over to meet Rhiannon at the door The only thing I know for certain right now is that compassion isnt going to help me on the mat after lunch Im so nervous I could puke as I stand at the side of the wide black mat watching Rhiannon beat the everloving shit out of her opponent Its a guy from Second Wing and it takes almost no time for her to get him into a headlock cutting off his air supply Its a move shes tried her best to drill into me over the last couple of weeks She makes it look so easy I say to Dain as he stands at my side his elbow brushing mine Hes going to try to kill you What I glance up then follow his line of sight two mats over Dains glaring daggers at Xaden across the mat a look of sheer boredom on his face as Rhiannon squeezes the neck of the Second Wing firstyear tighter Your opponent Dain says softly I overheard him and a few friends They think youre a liability to the wing thanks to that Barlowe kid His gaze shifts to Oren whos sizing me up like a damned plaything hes planning on breaking But theres a greenish twinge to his complexion that makes me grin Im going to be fine I recite because thats my fucking mantra Im stripped down to the dragonscale vest thats starting to feel like a second skin and my fighting leathers All four of my daggers are sheathed and if my plan goes correctly Ill have one more to add to my collection soon The Second Wing firstyear passes out and Rhiannon rises victorious as we clap Then she leans over her opponent and removes the dagger at his side Looks like this is mine now Enjoy your nap She pats him on the head which makes me laugh Not sure why youre laughing Sorrengail a sneering voice calls out from behind me I turn around and see Jack standing with his feet apart against the woodplanked wall about ten feet away wearing a smile that can only be described as evil Fuck off Barlowe I gift him the middle finger I honestly hope you win todays challenge His eyes dance with a sadistic glee that makes me queasy It would be a shame for someone else to kill you before I get the chance But I wouldnt be surprised Violets are such delicatefragile things you know Delicate my ass Hed probably think twice about plotting your murder if you threw a few daggers at his head I unsheathe both daggers from my ribs and flick them in his direction in one smooth movement They land right where I intendedone nearly nicking his ear and the other an inch beneath his balls Fear widens his eyes I shamelessly grin and wiggle my fingers in a wave Violet Dain hisses as Jack maneuvers around my blades stepping away from the wall Youll pay for that Jack points at me and stalks off but the rise and fall of his shoulders is a little choppy I watch his back retreat then retrieve my daggers sheathing them at my ribs before returning to Dains side What the hell was that he seethes I told you to lay low when it comes to him and you He shakes his head at me You just piss him off even more Laying low wasnt getting me anywhere I say with a shrug as Rhiannons opponent is carried off the mat He needs to realize Im not a liability And Ill be harder to kill than he thinks Theres no ignoring the prickle at my scalp and I let my gaze shift to meet Xadens My heart does that damn stuttering thing again as if hed sent shadows straight through my ribs to squeeze the organ He lifts his scarred brow and I swear theres a hint of a smile on his lips as he leaves walking over to observe the Fourth Wing cadets at the next mat Badass Rhiannon says as she moves to my other side I thought Jack was going to shit himself I smother a smile Stop encouraging her Dain chastises Sorrengail Professor Emetterio glances at his notebook and raises one bushy black brow before continuing Seifert Swallowing back the panic that threatens to creep up my throat I step onto the mat opposite Oren whos definitely looking green now Right on time Ive prepared the best I can wrapping my ankles and my knees just in case he goes for the legs Dont take this personally he says as we start to circle both our hands raised But youll only be a hazard to your wing He charges at me but his footwork is sluggish and I spin away landing a punch to his kidney before bouncing back on my heels and palming a dagger Im no more a hazard than you are I accuse His chest heaves once and sweat dots his forehead but he shakes it off blinking rapidly as he reaches for his own knife My sister is a healer Ive heard your bones snap like twigs Why dont you come find out I force a smile and wait for him to charge again because thats what he does Ive had three sessions to watch him from a few mats over Hes a bull all power and no grace His entire body rolls like hes going to vomit and he covers his mouth with his empty hand breathing deeply before standing straight again I should attack but instead I wait And then he charges his blade held high in a striking position My heart pounds as I wait the torturous heartbeats it takes for him to reach me my brain somehow convincing my body to hold my ground until the last possible second He swings his knife downward and I dodge to the left nicking his side with my blade in the process then turn and deliver a kick to his back sending him sprawling Now He falls to the mat and I take immediate advantage digging a knee into his spine just like Imogen had with me and putting my blade to his throat Yield Who needs strength when you have speed and steel No he shouts but his body undulates under mine and he retches bringing up everything hes eaten since breakfast and splattering it across the mat to the side of us So fucking gross Oh my gods Rhiannon calls out disgust dripping from her tone Yield I demand again but hes heaving in earnest now and I have to pull my knife away so I dont accidentally slit his throat He yields Professor Emetterio declares his face contorted in revulsion I sheathe my blade and climb off him dodging the puddles of sick Then I take the dagger Oren dropped a few feet back as he continues to vomit The knife is heavier and longer than my others but its mine now and I earned it I sheathe it in an empty place at my left thigh You won Rhiannon says clasping me in a hug as I walk off the mat Hes sick I say with a shrug Ill take being lucky over being good any day Rhiannon counters I have to find someone to get this cleaned up Dain says his own complexion turning peaked I won Timing is the hardest thing about my plan I win the next week when a stocky girl from First Wing cant concentrate long enough to throw a decent punch thanks to a few leighorrel mushrooms and their hallucinogenic properties that somehow wind up in her lunch She gets in a good kick to my knee but its nothing a few days in a wrap wont heal I win the week after that when a tall guy from Third Wing stumbles because his large feet temporarily lose all feeling courtesy of the zihna root that grows on one outcropping near the ravine My timing is off a little though and he lands a few good punches to my face leaving me with a split lip and a bruise that colors my cheek for the next eleven days but at least he doesnt break my jaw I win again the next week when a buxom cadets vision turns blurry midmatch on account of the tarsilla leaves that found their way into her tea Shes fast tossing me to the mat and delivering some overwhelmingly painful kicks to my abdomen that leave colorful contusions and one distinct boot print on my ribs I almost broke down and went to see Nolon after that one but I gritted my teeth and wrapped my ribs determined not to give the others a reason to weed me out like Jack or any marked ones wanted I earn my fifth dagger this one with a pretty ruby in the hilt the last challenge in August when I take a particularly sweaty guy with a gap between his front teeth to the mat The bark of the carmine tree that finds its way into his waterskin makes him sluggish and ill The effects are a little too similar to the fonilee berries and its just a shame that the entire Third Squad Claw Section of Third Wing is suffering the same stomach upset Must be something viral at least thats what I say when he finally yields to my headlock after dislocating my thumb and nearly breaking my nose Come early September theres a spring in my step as I walk onto the mat Ive taken down five opponents without killing any of them something a quarter of our year cant say after almost twenty more names have been added to the death roll the last month for the firstyears alone I roll my sore shoulders and wait for my opponent But Rayma Corrie from Third Wing doesnt step forward this week like shes supposed to Sorry Violet Professor Emetterio says scratching his short black beard You were supposed to challenge Rayma but shes been taken to the healers because she cant seem to walk in a straight line Peels of the walwyn fruit will do that when ingested rawsay like when theyre mixed into the icing of your morning pastry Thatsshittoo bad I wince You served it to her too early Should I just I start already backing up to get off the mat Im happy to step in That voice That tone That prickle of ice along my scalp Oh no Hell no No No No You sure Professor Emetterio asks glancing over his shoulder Absolutely My stomach hits the floor And Xaden walks onto the mat I will not die today Violet Sorrengails personal addendum to the Book of Brennan CHAPTER NINE Im so completely screwed Xaden steps forwardall sixfooteverything of himdressed in midnight fighting leathers and a tightfitted shortsleeve shirt that only seems to make the shimmering dark rebellion relics on his skin seem like an even bigger warning which I know is ridiculous but somehow true My heartbeat kicks up to a full gallop as if my body knows the truth my mind hasnt quite accepted yet Im about to have my ass kickedor worse You are all in for a treat Professor Emetterio says clapping his hands Xadens one of the best fighters we have Watch and learn Of course you are I mutter my stomach twisting like Im the one whos been snacking on walwyn fruit peels A corner of Xadens mouth rises in a smirk and the gold flecks in his eyes seem to dance The sadistic ass is enjoying this My knees ankles and wrist are wrapped the white cloth protecting my healing thumb a startling contrast against my black leathers A little out of her league dont you think Dain argues from the side of the mat tension radiating from every word Relax Aetos Xaden looks over my shoulder his gaze hardening toward where I know Dain is standing where he always stands when Im on the mat The look Xaden gives him makes me realize hes been taking it easy on me in the glaring department Shell be in one piece when Im finished teaching her I hardly think its fair Dains voice rises No one asked you to think squad leader Xaden fires back as he moves to the side discarding every weapon on his bodyand theres a lot of themand handing them to Imogen The bitter illogical taste of jealousy fills my mouth but theres no time to examine that particular oddity not when therere only seconds before hes in front of me again You dont think youll need those I ask palming my own blades His chest is massive with wide shoulders and heavily muscled arms alongside A target this big should be easy to hit Nope Not when you brought enough for the both of us A wicked smile curves his mouth as he stretches out his hand and curls his fingers in a comehither motion Lets go My heart beats faster than the wings of a hummingbird as I take a fighting stance and wait for him to strike This mat is only twenty feet in either direction and yet my entire world narrows to its confines and the danger within Hes not in my squad He can kill me without punishment I fling a dagger straight at his ridiculously wellsculpted chest He fucking catches it and clucks his tongue Already seen that move Holy shit is he fast I have to be faster Its the single advantage I havethats my only thought as I move forward in a swipeandkick combo Rhiannons drilled into me over the past six weeks He artfully dodges my blade and then captures my leg The earth spins and I slam onto my back the sudden impact driving the air from my lungs But he doesnt go for the kill Instead he drops the dagger hes caught and kicks it off the mat and a second later when air squeaks into my lungs I lunge up with the next blade going for his thigh He blocks my strike with his forearm then grips my wrist with his opposite hand and plucks the knife out of my hand leaning down so his face is only inches from mine Going for blood today are we Violence he whispers Metal hits the mat again and he kicks it past my head and out of my reach Hes not taking my daggers to use against me hes disarming me just to prove he can My blood boils My name is Violet I seethe I think my version fits you better He releases my wrist and stands offering me a hand Were not done yet My chest heaves still recovering from the way hes knocked the wind out of me and I take the offering He tugs me to my feet then twists my arm behind my back and yanks me against his hard chest pinning our joined hands before I have a chance to get my balance Damn it I snap Theres a tug at my thigh and another of my daggers is pressed to my throat as his chest rests against the back of my head His forearm is locked across my ribs and he might as well be a statue for all the give there is in his frame Theres no use slamming my head backhes so tall that Id only annoy him Dont trust a single person who faces you on this mat he warns in a hiss his breath warm against the shell of my ear and even though were surrounded by people I realize hes quiet for a reason This lesson is just for me Even someone who owes me a favor I counter my voice just as low My shoulder starts to protest the unnatural angle but I dont move I wont give him the satisfaction He drops the third dagger hes taken from me and kicks it forwardto where Dain stands the other two already in his hand Theres murder in his eyes as he glares at Xaden Im the one who decides when to grant that favor Not you Xaden releases my hand and steps back I whirl punching for his throat and he knocks my hand aside Good he says with a smile deflecting my next blow without so much as a hitch to his breath Going for the throat is your best option as long as its exposed Fury makes me kick out again in the same pattern muscle memory taking over and he captures that leg again this time snatching the dagger sheathed there and dropping it to the mat before he lets me go cocking a disappointed eyebrow at me I expect you to learn from your mistakes He kicks it away I only have five left all sheathed at my ribs Gripping one and putting my hands up defensively I begin to circle him and to my absolute annoyance he doesnt even bother facing me He just stands there in the center of the mat his boots planted and his arms loose as I move around him You going to prance or are you going to strike Fuck him I punch forward but he dips and my knife sails over his shoulder missing him by six inches My stomach drops as he grips my arm yanking me forward and flipping me around the side of his body Im airborne for a heartbeat before I smack into the mat my ribs taking the impact He cranks my arm into a submission hold and whitehot pain shoots down the limb as I cry out dropping the dagger but hes not done No his knee is in my ribs and though he holds my arm captive with one hand the other plucks a dagger from its sheath and flings it toward Dains feet before taking another and holding it to the tender area where my jaw meets my neck Then he leans closer Taking out your enemy before the battle is really smart Ill give that to you he whispers his warm breath brushing the shell of my ear Oh gods He knows what Ive been doing The pain in my arm is nothing compared to the nausea churning in my stomach at the thought of what he might do with that knowledge Problem is if you arent testing yourself in herehe scrapes the dagger down my neck but theres no warm trickle of blood so I know he hasnt cut methen youre not going to get any better Youd rather I die no doubt I fire back the side of my face pressed into the mat This isnt just painful its humiliating And be denied the pleasure of your company he mocks I fucking hate you The words are past my lips before I can shut my mouth That doesnt make you special The pressure releases from my chest and arm as he gets on his feet kicking both daggers toward Dain Two more I only have two more and now my indignation and anger far outweigh my fear Ignoring Xadens outstretched hand I gain my feet and his lips curve into an approving smile She can be taught Shes a quick learner I retort That remains to be seen He backs up two steps putting a little space between us before crooking his fingers at me again Youve made your damn point I snap loud enough that I hear Imogen gasp Trust me Ive barely gotten started He folds his arms and leans back on his heels clearly waiting for me to move I dont think I just act going low and kicking out the backs of his knees He goes down like a tree the sound more than satisfying and I pounce trying for a headlock Doesnt matter how big someone isthey still need air Catching his throat in the crook of my elbow I squeeze Instead of going for my arms he twists grabbing ahold of the backs of my thighs so I lose my leverage and our bodies careen into a roll He comes out on top Of course he does His forearm rests against my throat not cutting off air but definitely capable of it and his hips have mine pinned my legs useless on either side of his as he lies heavily between my thighs Hes unmovable Everything around us fades as my world narrows to the arrogant glint in his gaze Hes all I can see all I can feel And I cant let him win I slip one of my last daggers free and go for his shoulder He seizes my wrist and pins it above my head Shit Shit SHIT Heat rushes up my neck and flames lick my cheeks as he lowers his face so his lips are only inches away from mine I can make out every speck of gold in his onyx eyes every bump and ridge of his scar Beautiful Fucking Asshole My breath catches and my body warms the traitorous bitch You are not attracted to toxic men I remind myself and yet here I am getting all attracted I have been since the first second I saw him if I feel like being honest He pushes his fingers into my fist forcing it open then sends the blade skittering across the mat before letting go of my wrist Get your dagger he orders What My eyes fly wide He has me defenseless and in the kill position already Get Your Dagger he repeats taking my hand in his and retrieving the last blade I have His fingers curl over mine clasping the hilt Fire races along my skin at the feel of his fingers lacing with mine Toxic Dangerous Wants to kill you Nope doesnt matter My pulse still skitters like a teenager Youre tiny He says it like an insult Well aware My eyes narrow So stop going for bigger moves that expose you He drags the tip of the dagger down his side A rib shot would have worked just fine Then he guides our hands around his back making himself vulnerable Kidneys are a good fit from this angle too I swallow refusing to think of other things that are a good fit at this angle He leads our hands to his waist his gaze never leaving mine Chances are if your opponent is in armor its weak here Those are three easy places you could have struck before your opponent would have had time to stop you Theyre also fatal wounds and Ive avoided those at all costs Do you hear me I nod Good Because you cant poison every enemy you come across he whispers and I blanche Youre not going to have time to offer tea to some Braevi gryphon rider when they come at you How did you know I finally ask My muscles lock including my thighs which just happen to still be bracketing his hips His eyes darken Oh Violence youre good but Ive known better poison masters The trick is to not make it quite so obvious My lips part and I bite back a retort that I was careful not to be obvious I think shes been taught enough for the day Dain barks reminding me that were far from alone No were a damned spectacle He always that overprotective Xaden grumbles pressing up from the mat a few inches He cares about me I glare at him Hes holding you back Dont worry Your little poisoning secret is safe with me Xaden arches a brow as if to remind me that Im the keeper of one of his secrets too Then he guides our hands back to my ribs and slides the rubyhilted blade back into its sheath The move is unnervinglyhot Youre not going to disarm me I challenge as he releases his grip and pushes up more removing his weight from my body My ribs expand as I take my first full breath Nope Defenseless women have never been my type Were done for today He stands then walks away without another word taking his weapons from Imogen as I roll to my knees Every part of my body aches but I manage to stand Theres pure relief in Dains eyes when I reach his side to retrieve the daggers Xaden took from me You all right I nod my fingers trembling as I rearm myself Hes had every chance and every reason to kill me and now hes let me walk away twice What kind of game is he playing Aetos Xaden calls out from across the mat Dains head snaps up and his jaw locks She could use a little less protection and a little more instruction Xaden stares Dain down until he nods Professor Emetterio calls the next challenge Im just surprised he let you live Dain says later that night in his room as his thumbs dig into the muscle between my neck and shoulder It hurts so deliciously it was well worth the pain of sneaking up here I hardly think hed command respect by snapping my neck on the mat His blankets are soft against my belly and chest as I lay on his bed bare from the waist up except for the constricting band around my breasts and ribs Besides thats not his way Dains hands pause on my skin Because you know what his way is The guilt of keeping Xadens secret makes my stomach drop He told me he didnt see a reason to kill me himself when the parapet would do it I answer truthfully And lets face it hes had plenty of chances to take me out if he really wanted Hmm Dain hums in that thoughtful tone of his continuing to work out my stiff and aching muscles as he leans over from the side of his bed Rhiannon drilled me for another two hours after dinner and I was barely able to move by the end of it Guess I wasnt the only one Xaden scared this afternoon Do you think he could be plotting against Navarre and still have bonded Sgaeyl I ask my cheek against his blanket I did at first His hands move down my spine pressing into the knots that made lifting my arms almost impossible that last half hour of training tonight But then I bonded Cath and I realized that dragons would do anything to protect the Vale and their sacred hatching grounds Theres no way any dragon would have bonded Riorson or any of the separatists if they werent honest about protecting Navarre But would a dragon even know if you were lying I turn my head so I can see his face Yeah He grins Cath would know because hes in my head Its impossible to hide something like that from your dragon Is he always in your head I know its against the rules to askalmost everything about bonds are offlimits for discussion given how secretive dragons are but its Dain Yeah he answers his smile softening I can block him out if I need to and theyll teach you that after Threshing His expression falls What is it I sit up sliding one of his pillows across my chest and leaning back against the headboard I talked to Colonel Markham this evening He walks over and pulls his chair out from his desk and takes a seat then rests his head in his hands Did something happen Fear races down my spine Is it Miras wing No Dains head snaps up and theres so much misery in his eyes that I swing my feet off the bed Its nothing like that I told himthat I think Riorson wants to kill you I blink sitting fully back onto the bed Oh Well thats not really news is it Everyone whos read a history of the rebellion can put two and two together Dain Yeah well I told him about Barlowe too and Seifert He rubs his hand over his hair Dont think I didnt notice the way Seifert shoved you into the wall before formation this morning He lifts his brows at me Hes just pissed that I took his dagger at that first challenge I squeeze the pillow tighter And Rhiannon told me you found crushed flowers on your bed last week He stares me down I shrug They were just dead flowers They were mutilated violets His mouth tightens and I go to him resting my hands on his head Its not like they came with a death note or anything I tease stroking his soft brown hair He looks up at me the mage lights making his eyes a little brighter above his trim beard Theyre threats I shrug Every cadet gets threatened Every cadet doesnt have to wrap their knees every day he fires back The injured ones do My brow furrows annoyance taking root in my chest Why would you tell Markham about it anyway Hes a scribe and theres nothing he would do even if he could He said hed still take you Dain blurts his hands flying to my hips holding me in place when I try to step away I asked him if hed allow you into the Scribe Quadrant for your own safety and he said yes Theyd put you with the firstyears Its not like youd have to wait until next Conscription Day or anything You what I twist breaking my hold and back away from my best friend I saw a way to get you out of danger and I took it He stands You went behind my back because you think Im not cutting it The truth of the words tightens around my chest like a vise cutting off my air instead of holding me together leaving me weak and breathless Dain knows me better than anyone and if he still thinks I cant do this after Ive made it this far Tears well in my eyes but I refuse to let them fall Instead I tuck my chin and grab my dragonscale vest pull it over my head then wrench the laces together at the small of my back and tie them Dain sighs I never said I dont think you can cut it Violet You say it every day I snap You say it when you walk me from formation to class which I know makes you late for flight line You say it when you yell at your wingleader when he takes me to the mat He had no right to Hes my wingleader I shrug my tunic over my head He has the right to do whatever he wantsincluding execute me And thats why you need to get the hell out of here Dain laces his fingers behind his neck and begins to pace Ive been watching Vi Hes just toying with you like a cat plays with a mouse before the kill Ive held my own so far My satchel is heavy with books as I settle it over my shoulder Ive won every challenge Except today when he wiped the floor with you time and again He grasps my shoulders Or did you miss the part where he took every weapon so you knew exactly how easy it is to defeat you I raise my chin and glare at him I was there and Ive survived almost two months in this place which is more than I can say for a fourth of my year Do you know what happens at Threshing he asks his tone dropping Are you calling me ignorant Rage bubbles in my veins Its not just about bonding he continues They throw every firstyear into the training grounds the ones youve never been to and then the second and thirdyears are supposed to watch as you decide which dragons to approach and which to run from I know how it works My jaw clenches Yeah well while the riders are watching the firstyears are taking out their vendettas and eliminating anyliabilities to the wing Im not a damned liability My chest tightens again because deep down I know on the physical level that I am Not to me he whispers a hand rising to cradle my cheek But they dont know you the way I do Vi And while the firstyears like Barlowe and Seifert are hunting you well have to watch Ill have to watch Violet The break in his voice takes the anger right out of me We are not allowed to help you To save you Dain And when they gather the bodies for the roll no ones going to document how that cadet died Youre just as likely to fall under Barlowes knife as a dragons talon I breathe through the jolt of fear Markham says that hell put you through the first year without telling your mother By the time she finds out youll already be inducted as a scribe Theres nothing she can do after that He lifts his other hand so hes holding my face between both palms tipping it up toward his Please If you wont do it for yourself then do it for me My heart stutters and I sway his reasoning tugging me toward exactly what hes suggesting But youve made it this far a part of me whispers I cant lose you Violet he whispers resting his forehead against mine I justcant I squeeze my eyes shut This is my way out and yet I dont want to take it Just promise me youll think about it he begs We still have four weeks until Threshing Justthink about it The hope in his tone and the tender way he holds me cuts through my defenses Ill think about it Dont underestimate the challenge of the Gauntlet Mira Its designed to test your balance strength and agility The times dont matter for shit only that you make it to the top Reach for the ropes when you have to Coming in last is better than coming in dead Page fortysix the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TEN I look up and up and up fear coiling in my stomach like a snake ready to strike Well thats Rhiannon swallows her head tilted just as far back as mine as we stare at the menacing obstacle course thats carved into the front of a ridgeline so steep it might as well be a cliff The zigzagging death trap of a trail rises above us climbing in five distinct switchbacks of 180degree turns each increasing in difficulty on the way to the top of the bluff that divides the citadel from the flight field and the Vale Amazing Aurelie sighs Rhiannon and I turn both staring at her like she must have hit her head You think that hellscape looks amazing Rhiannon asks Ive been waiting years for this Aurelie grins her normally serious black eyes dancing in the morning sun as she rubs her hands together shifting from one toned leg to the other in glee My dadhe was a rider until he retired last yearused to set up obstacle courses like this all the time so we could practice and Chase my brother said its the best part of being here before Threshing Its a real adrenaline rush Hes with the Southern Wing right I ask focusing on the obstacle course running up the side of a fucking cliff It looks more like a death trap than an adrenaline rush but sure we can go with that Positive thinking for the win right Yep Pretty much desk duty for all the action they see near the Krovlan border She shrugs and points about twothirds up the course He said to watch out for those giant posts jutting from the side of the cliff They spin and you can get crushed between them if youre not fast enough Oh good I was wondering when it might get difficult Rhiannon mutters Thanks Aurelie I locate the series of nearly touching threefootwide logs that jut out from the rocky terrain like a set of round steps rising from the ground to the switchback above it and nod Go fast Got it You could have included that tidbit Brennan The obstacle course is the embodiment of my worst nightmare For the first time since Dain begged me to leave last week I consider Markhams offer There are no death courses in the Scribe Quadrant thats for certain But youve already made it this far Ahh there she is the little voice thats been riding my shoulder lately daring to give me hope that I might actually survive Presentation Still not sure why they call it the Gauntlet Ridoc says from my right blowing into his cupped hands to ward off the morning chill The sun hasnt touched this little crevice but its shining above the last quarter of the course To ensure dragons keep coming to Threshing by weeding out the weaklings Tynan sneers from Ridocs other side folding his arms over his chest as he casts a pointed look at me I shoot him a glare and then shake it off Hes been pissy ever since Rhiannon handed his ass to him on the mat at assessment Knock it the fuck off Ridoc snaps earning the entire squads attention My eyebrows lift Ive never seen Ridoc lose his temper or use anything but humor to defuse a situation before Whats your problem Tynan shoves a strand of thick dark hair from his eyes and pivots like hes going to stare some intimidation into Ridoc but it doesnt really work out seeing as Ridoc is twice as wide and half a foot taller My problem You think because you made friends with Barlowe and Siefert that you have the right to be a dick to your own squadmate Ridoc challenges Exactly Squadmate Tynan gestures toward the obstacle course Our times arent just ranked individually Ridoc Were scored as a squad too which is how the order for Presentation is decided Do you really think any dragon wants to bond a cadet who walks in after every other squad in the processional Fine he has a point Its a shitty one but its there Theyre not timing us for Presentation today asshole Ridoc takes a step forward Stop Sawyer shuffles between the two shoving Tynans chest hard enough to make him stagger back into the girl behind him Take it from someone who made it through Presentation last year your time doesnt mean anything The last cadet to walk in last year bonded just fine and some of the cadets in the first squad onto the field were passed over Little bitter about that arent you Tynan smirks Sawyer ignores the barb Besides its not called the Gauntlet because it weeds out cadets Its called the Gauntlet because this is the cliff that guards the Vale Professor Emetterio says walking up behind our squad his shaved head glinting in the growing sunlight Plus actual gauntletsarmored gloves made of metalare slippery as hell and the name stuck about twenty years ago He cocks a brow at Tynan and Sawyer Are you two done arguing Because all nine of you have exactly an hour to get to the top before its another squads chance to practice and from what Ive seen of your agility on the mat youre going to need every second Theres a grumble of assent in our little group As you know handtohand challenges are on hold for the next two and a half weeks before Presentation so you can focus here Professor Emetterio flips a page on the little notebook he carries Sawyer youre going to show them how its done since you already have the lay of the land Then Pryor Trina Tynan Rhiannon Ridoc Violet Aurelie and Luca A smile curves the harsh line of his mouth as he finishes calling out every name in our squad and we file into order Youre the only squad to remain intact since Parapet Thats incredible Your squad leader must be very proud Wait here for a second He walks past us waving at someone high up on the cliff No doubt that someone has a watch Aetos is especially proud of Sorrengail Tynan gifts me with a mocking sneer once our instructor is out of hearing range I see red Look if you want to talk shit about me thats one thing but leave Dain out of it Tynan Sawyer warns shaking his head Like it doesnt bother any of you that our squad leader is fucking one of us Tynan throws out his hands Im not I start indignation getting the best of me before I can take a deep breath Honestly its none of your godsdamned business who Im sleeping with Tynan Though if Im going to get accused cant I have some of the perks If I know Dain hes hung up on the whole fraternizationisdiscouragedwithinthechainofcommand thing like this asshole But surely Dain would actually make a move if he really wanted to right It is if it means you get preferential treatment Luca adds in For fucks sake Rhiannon mumbles rubbing the bridge of her nose Luca Tynan shut up Theyre not sleeping together Theyve been friends since they were kids or do you not know enough about our own leadership to know his dad is her moms aide Tynans eyes widen like hes actually surprised Really Really I shake my head and study the course Shit Imsorry Barlowe said And thats your first mistake Ridoc interjects Listening to that sadistic ass is going to get you killed And youre lucky Aetos isnt here True Dain would more than take exception to Tynans assumptions and probably assign him cleanup duty for a month Good thing hes on the flight field this time of day Xaden would just beat the shit out of him I blink shoving that comparison and any other thought of Xaden Riorson far out of my head Here we go Professor Emetterio walks to the head of our line Youll get your time at the top of the course if you make it but remember youll still have nine practice sessions before we rank you for Presentation in two and a half weeks which will determine if the dragons find you worthy at Threshing Wouldnt it make more sense to let firstyears start practicing this thing right after Parapet Rhiannon asks You know to give us a little more time so we dont die No Professor Emetterio replies The timing is part of the challenge Any words of wisdom Sawyer Sawyer blows out a slow breath his gaze following the treacherous course There are ropes every six feet that run from the top of the sheer cliffside to the bottom he says So if you start to fall reach out and grab a rope Itll cost you thirty seconds but death costs you more Awesome I mean theres a perfectly good set of steps over there Ridoc points to the steep staircase carved into the cliff beside the wide switchbacks of the Gauntlet Stairs are for reaching the flight field on the top of the ridgeline after Presentation Professor Emetterio says then lifts his hands toward the course and flicks his wrist pointing at various obstacles The fifteenfoot log at the start of the uphill climb begins to spin The pillars on the third ascent shake The giant wheel at the first switchback starts its counterclockwise rotation and those little posts Aurelie mentioned They all twist in opposite directions Every one of the five ascents on this course is designed to mimic the challenges youll face in battle Professor Emetterio turns to look at us his face just as stern as it is during our usual combat training From the balance you must keep on the back of your dragon to the strength youll need to hold your seat during maneuvers tohe gestures upward toward the last obstacle that looks like a ninetydegree ramp from this anglethe stamina youll need to fight on the ground then still be able to mount your dragon at a seconds notice The posts knock a chunk of granite loose and the rock tumbles down the course smacking every obstacle in its path until it crashes twenty feet in front of us If there was ever a metaphor for my life wellthats it Whoa Trina whispers her brown eyes wide as she stares at the pulverized rock Im the smallest of our squad but Trina is the quietest the most reserved I can count on both hands the number of times shes spoken to me since Parapet If she didnt have friends in First Wing Id worry but she doesnt have to open up to us to survive the quadrant You all right I ask her in a whisper She swallows and nods one of her auburn ringlet curls bouncing against her forehead What if we cant make it up Luca asks from my right securing her long hair in a loose braid her usual haughtiness not so inyourface today Whats the alternative route Theres no alternative If you dont make it you cant get to Presentation can you Take your position Sawyer Professor Emetterio orders and Sawyer moves to the beginning of the course After he makes it past the final obstacle so everyone can learn from this cadet completing the course the rest of you will start every sixty seconds Andgo Sawyer is off like a shot He easily runs the fifteen feet across the single log spinning parallel with the cliff face and then the raised pillars but it takes him three rotations inside the wheel before he jumps through the lone opening but other than that I dont see a single misstep in the first ascent Not One He turns and rushes toward a series of giant hanging balls that makes up the second ascent jumping and hugging one after another His feet back on the ground he turns again and heads up the third ascent which is divided into two sections The first part has giant metal rods hanging parallel to the cliff wall and he easily swings arm over arm using his bodys weight and momentum to swing the bar forward and reach the next bar hanging half a foot higher than the previous as he climbs the side of the cliff From the last bar he jumps onto a series of shaking pillars that make up the second half of this ascent before finally leaping back onto the gravel path By the time he reaches the fourth ascent the spinning logs Aurelies brother warned us about Sawyers made it all look like childs play and I start to feel a bubble of hope that maybe the course isnt as difficult as it looks from the ground But then he faces a giant chimney formation rising high above him at a twentydegree angle and pauses You got this Rhiannon yells from my side As though he heard he sprints toward the leaning chimney and flings himself upward grabbing onto the sides by forming an X with his body then starts hopping up the conduit until he reaches the end and drops down in front of the final obstacle a massive ramp that reaches up to the top of the cliffs edge at a nearly vertical climb My breath catches in my throat as Sawyer sprints toward the ramp using his speed and momentum to carry him twothirds of the way up the ramp Just before he starts to fall he reaches up with one arm and grasps the lip of the ramp and hauls himself over the edge Rhiannon and I scream and cheer for him He made it In an almost flawless approach Perfect technique Professor Emetterio calls out Thats exactly what you should all be doing Perfect and yet he was still passed over at Threshing Luca snarks Guess the dragons have some sense of taste Give it a rest Luca Rhi says How could someone as smart and athletic as Sawyer not bond And if he didnt what the hell kind of hope is there for the rest of us Im too short for the ramp I whisper to Rhi She glances over at me and then back to the obstacle Youre wicked fast If you get your speed up I bet the momentum will take you to the top Pryorthe shy cadet from the Krovlan border regionstruggles on the swinging steel rods in the third ascent due to some rather predictable hesitation on his part but he makes it just as Trina nearly falls at the shaking pillars reaching for a rope I can only make out the flash of red from her hair when she starts the rotating stair steps but I hear her scream all the way to my toes as that particular rope sways near the ground You can do it Sawyer shouts down from the top They go in opposite directions Aurelie calls up Tynan start Professor Emetterio orders watching his pocket watch and not the course My heart thuds in my ears when Trina makes it past the steps and the drumming doesnt let up as Rhiannon is called to start She passes the first ascent with the grace Ive come to expect from her before coming to a halt Tynan hangs from the second of five buoy balls on the second ascent right where the ground drops out If he falls hes got a minuscule chance of hitting the single spinning log from the first ascent and overwhelming odds of dropping thirty feet to the ground below You have to keep moving Tynan I shout though its doubtful he can hear me from here He might be a gullible ass but hes still my squadmate He shrieks his arms wrapped around the swinging ball Its impossible for him to reach his hands completely aroundthats the point and hes slipping Hes going to screw her time Aurelie says blowing out a bored sigh Good thing this is only practice then Ridoc says then bellows up at Tynan Whats the matter Tynan Scared of heights Whos the liability now Stop I elbow Ridoc in the side Hes not quite as lean now The last seven weeks have put some muscle on him Just because hes a dick doesnt mean you have to be But hes giving me so much material to work with Ridoc replies a corner of his mouth lifting into a smirk as he backs away heading toward the starting position Swing to the next one Trina suggests from the top of the course I cant Tynans shriek could break glass as it echoes down the mountain and it makes my chest tighten Ridoc start Professor Emetterio commands Ridoc charges over the log Rhi I shout up The rope is between the first and second She nods down at me then jumps for the first buoy ball clasping it up top near where the chains hold it to the iron rail above and swinging her weight around the side Its an utterly inspired approach one that might just work for me Gravel crunches beneath my boots as I move to the starting position Oh look it is possible for my heart to beat faster The damned thing practically flutters as I wipe my clammy palms on my leather pants Rhiannon gets the rope into Tynans hand but instead of using it to swing to the next ball he climbsdown My jaw practically unhinges as he descends Definitely didnt see that one coming Violet begin Emetterio orders Be with me Zihnal I havent spent nearly enough time at temple for the god of luck to care much about what happens to me right now but its worth a shot I bolt up the first part of the ascent coming to the spinning log within seconds My stomach feels like its being stirred by this balance beam from hell Its just balance You can balance I mumble and start across Quick feet Quick feet Quick feet I repeat all the way across jumping off the end to land on the first of four granite columns each one higher than the last There are about three feet between them but I manage to leap from one pillar to the next without skidding off the ends And this is the easy part A knot of fear works its way up my throat I jump into the rotating wheel and run leaping over the only opening as it flies by once then watching it come around a second time Timing This one is all about timing The opportunity comes and I seize it racing through the opening and turning back onto the gravel path of the second ascent The buoy balls are just ahead but Im going to fall on my ass if I dont calm down and get my palms to stop sweating Feathertail dragons are the breed we know the least about I recite in my mind needing every ounce of my lung capacity as I spring from the edge of the path onto the first ball grasping it up top like Rhiannon did The immediate strain on my shoulders makes me tense every muscle to keep the joints from dislocating Stay calm Stay calm Throwing my weight I force the ball to rotate swinging me toward the next one This is because feathertails reportedly abhor violence and are not suitable for bonding I repeat motions grasping from one ball to the next keeping my eyes on the chains and nothing else Though this scholar can not be certain as one has never left the Vale within my lifetime I continue reciting from memory as I reach the fifth and final ball With one last swing I throw myself sideways releasing the ball and landing on the shoulderwide gravel path without rolling an ankle Its all momentum for the next ascent Green dragons I mutter under my breath known for their keen intellect descend from the honorable Uaineloidsig line and continue to be the most rational of dragonkind making them the perfect siege weapons especially in the case of clubtails I finish as I line my body up with the first metal rod and get ready to sprint forward Are youstudying Aurelie calls up from where she leaps onto the first ball below Calms me down I shoot back in quick explanation Theres no time to be embarrassed herethat can wait for later There are three iron rails in front of me each lined up like a battering ram toward the next The Scribe Quadrant is looking pretty good right now I grumble under my breath then launch myself toward the first At least the texture gives me something to keep hold of as I work my way hand over hand The ache in my shoulders grows into a throbbing pain when I reach the end of the first rail swinging my feet to work up the momentum for the next The first clang of iron as the rails meet makes my fingers slip and I gasp as terror claws its way out of my stomach Orange dragons coming in various shades of apricot to carrot are the mostI throw myself to the next railunpredictable of dragonkind and therefore always a risk I move across the rail with the same handoverhand motion ignoring the outright protests of my shoulders Descending from the Fhaicorain line My right hand loses purchase and my weight swings me into the face of the steep mountainside my cheek slamming into the rock A highpitched ringing erupts in my ears and my vision darkens at the edges Violet Rhiannon shouts from the top Next to you The rope is next to you Aurelie calls up Iron scrapes my fingertips as my left hand slips but I spot the rope and take hold bracing my feet on the knot beneath me and clinging tight until the ringing fades in my head I have to swing over or climb down Ive survived seven weeks in this damned quadrant and this course isnt going to beat me today Pushing off the edge I swing out for the rail and make it immediately starting the hand over hand to get me to the next one and then the next until I finally let go landing on the first shaking iron pillar My brain is rattled as the thing shudders violently and I leap to the next barely gaining a foothold before jumping to the gravel path at the end of the ascent Aurelie is right behind me landing with a grin This is the best You clearly need to see the healers You must have hit your head if you think this is fun My breaths are choppy gasps but I cant help but smile at her obvious joy Just run straight across this one she says as we reach the twisting staircase posts jutting straight from the side of the cliff face Each threefootwide timber rotates from its base in one of the steepest sections of the course I quickly calculate if you fall off one of the posts youd probably drop at least thirty or forty feet onto the rocky terrain below I swallow down the terror trying to crawl up my throat and focus on the possibility my agility and lightness will give me an edge on this particular obstacle She continues Trust me If you pause itll roll you right off I nod and bounce on my feet dredging up whatever courage I have left Then I run My feet are quick making contact with each post only long enough to push off for the next and within a few heartbeats Im on the other side Yes I shout throwing my fist up in celebration as I get out of the way for Aurelie Go Violet she shouts Here I come Her footwork is more agile than mine as she springs from spinning post to post A roar sounds from overhead and I jerk my gaze up just in time to see the underbelly of a Green Daggertail as it flies directly over us headed back to the Vale Im never going to get used to that Aurelie cries out and my head snaps toward hers just in time to see her wobble and slip on the fifth post The air freezes in my lungs as she careens forward her belly hitting the nexttolast spinning log as if in slow motion Aurelie I scream lunging for her my fingertips skimming the seventh post Our eyes meet shock and terror filling her wide black eyes as the post rolls her away from me and she falls Halfway down the cliff The sun burns my eyes as we stand in morning formation Calvin Atwater Captain Fitzgibbons reads his voice solemn like always First Squad Claw Section Fourth Wing He sits two rows behind me in Battle Brief He sat Theres nothing special about this morning Our first trial on the Gauntlet has made the roll longer but its just another list on just another dayexcept its not The exceptional cruelty of this ritual has never hit me this hard before Its not like the first day anymore I know more than half of the names as theyre called My vision blurs Newland Jahvon he continues Second Squad Flame Section Fourth Wing He had breakfast duty with me We have to be in the twenties by now How can this be all there is We say their names once and then go on as if they never existed Rhiannon shifts her weight at my side and she abruptly sniffles the motion jerking her shoulders once Aurelie Donans A single tear escapes and I bat it away ripping open one of the scabs along my cheek A trickle of blood follows as the next name is called but I let that one stain me Youre sure about this Dain asks the next night two worried lines between his brows as he clasps my shoulders If her parents arent coming to bury her body then I should be the one to handle her things Im the last person she saw I explain rolling my shoulders to adjust the weight of Aurelies pack Every Basgiath parent has the same option when their cadet is killed They can retrieve the body and personal effects for burial or burning or the school will put their body under a stone and burn their effects themselves Aurelies parents have chosen door number two And you dont want me to go with you he asks palming my neck I shake my head I know where the burn pit is He mutters a curse I should have been there You couldnt have done anything Dain I say softly covering his hand with mine so our fingers lightly lace None of us could have She didnt even have time to reach for the rope I whisper Ive replayed that moment over and over in my head coming to the same conclusion each time I never got the chance to ask you if you made it all the way up he says I shake my head I got caught at the chimney formation and had to use a rope to get back down Im too short to span the distance but Im not thinking about that tonight Ill figure something out before the official timed Gauntlet on Presentation day Ill have to They dont allow cadets to climb back down on the final day You either complete the Gauntletor you fall to your death All right Let me know if you need me He lets me go I nod and make every excuse to get out of the dormitory hallway The weight of Aurelies pack is staggering She was strong enough to carry so much over the parapet and yet she fell And Im somehow still standing I cant shake the feeling that Im carrying her with me as I climb the stairs of the academic towers turret past the Battle Brief room and up to the stone roof going by a few other cadets on their way down The burn pit is nothing more than an extrawide iron barrel whose only purpose is to incinerate and the flames burn bright against the night sky as I stumble out onto the roof my lungs straining for oxygen A couple of months ago I couldnt have carried a pack this heavy Theres no one else up here as I slip the bag from my shoulder Im so sorry I whisper my fingers digging into the wide strap of the pack as I fling it up and over the metal edge of the bin The flames catch and whoosh as it becomes more fuel for the fire just another tribute to Malek the god of death Instead of walking back down the stairs I make my way to the edge of the turret Its a cloudy night but I can make out the shadows of three dragons as they approach from the west and even see the ridge where the Gauntlet lays waiting to claim its next victim It wont be me But why Because Ill conquer it Or because Ill give in to Dains request and hide in the Scribe Quadrant My entire being repels against the second option which makes me question everything as I stand here letting minutes tick by before the bells sound for curfew I climb back down the stairs without a solid answer as to why I walk through the courtyard empty but for a couple who cant decide if theyd rather kiss or walk near the dais and I avert my gaze heading for the alcove where Dain and I first sat after Parapet Its almost been two months and Im still here Still waking every morning to the sunrise Doesnt that mean something Isnt there a chance no matter how small that I might just be enough to make it through Threshing That I might just belong here The door that leads to the tunnel we took to cross the ridgeline to the Gauntlet this morning opens along the courtyard wall just left of the academic building and my brow furrows Who would be returning this late Sitting back against the wall I let the darkness conceal me as Xaden Garrick and BodhiXadens cousinpass under a mage light headed in my direction Three dragons They were outdoing what There were no training ops that I know of tonight not that Im privy to everything thirdyears do There has to be something more we can do Bodhi argues looking to Xaden his voice low as they pass by me their boots crunching on the gravel Were doing everything we can Garrick hisses My scalp prickles and Xaden stops midstep ten feet away the set of his shoulders rigid Shit He knows Im here Instead of the usual fear that spikes in his presence only anger rises in my chest If he wants to kill me then fine Im over waiting for it to happen Over walking through the halls in fear Whats wrong Garrick asks immediately looking over his shoulder in the opposite direction toward the couple who definitely decided making out is more important than getting into the dorms by curfew Go on Ill meet you inside Xaden says You sure Bodhis forehead puckers and his gaze sweeps over the courtyard Go Xaden orders standing completely still until the other two walk into the barracks turning left toward the stairwell that will take them to the second and thirdyear floors Only when theyre gone does he turn and face the exact spot where Im sitting I know you know Im here I force myself to stand and move toward him so he doesnt think Im hiding or worsescared of him And please dont prattle on about commanding the dark Im not in the mood tonight No questions about where Ive been He folds his arms across his chest and studies me in the moonlight His scar looks even more menacing in this light but I cant seem to find the energy to be scared I honestly dont care I shrug the movement making the throb in my shoulders intensify Awesome just in time to practice on the Gauntlet tomorrow He cocks his head to the side You really dont do you Nope Its not like Im not out after curfew myself A heavy sigh blows through my lips What are you doing out after curfew firstyear Debating running away I retort How about you Feel like sharing I ask mockingly knowing hes not about to answer me The same Sarcastic ass Look are you going to kill me or not The anticipation is starting to annoy the fuck out of me I lift a hand to my shoulder and roll it pressing in on the sore muscles but it doesnt help the ache Havent decided yet he answers like Ive just inquired about his dinner preferences but his gaze narrows on my cheek Well could you I mutter It would definitely help me make my plans for the week Markham or Emetterio Scribe or rider Am I affecting your schedule Violence Theres a definite smirk on those lips I just need to know what my chances are here My hands curl into fists The ass has the nerve to smile Thats the oddest way Ive ever been hit on Not my chances with you you conceited prick Fuck this Fuck all of this I move past him but he catches my wrist his grip light but his hold firm His fingertips on my pulse make it skitter Chances at what he asks tugging me just close enough that my shoulder brushes his biceps Nothing He wouldnt understand Hes a damned wingleader which means hes excelled at everything in the quadrant even somehow managing to get past his own last name Chances at what he repeats Do not make me ask three times His ominous tone is at odds with his gentle grasp and shit does he have to smell so good Like mint and leather and something I cant quite identify something that borders between citrus and floral At living through all of this I cant make it up the damned Gauntlet I halfheartedly tug at my wrist but he doesnt let go I see Hes so infuriatingly calm and I cant even get a grip on one of my emotions No you dont Youre probably celebrating because Ill fall to my death and you wont have to go to the trouble of killing me Killing you wouldnt be any trouble Violence Its leaving you alive that seems to cause the majority of my trouble My gaze swings up to clash with his but his face is unreadable cloaked in shadow go figure Sorry to be a hassle Sarcasm drips from my voice You know the problem with this place I tug my arm back again but he holds fast Besides you touching things that dont belong to you My eyes narrow on him Im sure youre going to tell me My stomach flutters as his thumb brushes my pulse and he releases my wrist I answer before I can think better of it Hope Hope He tips his head closer to mine as if he wasnt sure he heard me right Hope I nod Someone like you would never get it but I knew coming here was a death sentence It didnt matter that Ive been trained my entire life to enter the Scribe Quadrant when General Sorrengail gives an order you cant exactly ignore it Gods why am I running off at the mouth to this man Whats the worst hell do Kill you Sure you can He shrugs You just might not like the consequences I roll my eyes and to my utter embarrassment instead of pulling away now that Im free I lean in just a little like I can siphon off some of his strength He certainly has enough to spare I knew what the odds were and I came anyway concentrating on that tiny percentage of a chance that I would live And then I make it almost two months and I get I shake my head clenching my jaw Hopeful The word tastes sour Ah And then you lose a squadmate and you cant quite get up the chimney and you give up Im starting to see Its not a flattering picture but if you want to run off to the Scribe Quadrant I gasp fear punching a hole in my stomach How do you know about that If he knowsif he tells Dain is in danger A wicked smile curves Xadens perfect lips I know everything that goes on here Darkness swirls around us Shadows remember They hear everything see everything conceal everything The rest of the world disappears He could do anything to me in here and no one would be the wiser My mother would definitely reward you if you told her about Dains plan I say softly Shed definitely reward you for telling her about my littlewhat did you call it Club Im not going to tell her The words sound defensive I know Its why youre still alive He holds my gaze locked with his Heres the thing Sorrengail Hope is a fickle dangerous thing It steals your focus and aims it toward the possibilities instead of keeping it where it belongson the probabilities So Im supposed to what Not hope that I live Just plan for death Youre supposed to focus on the things that can kill you so you find ways to not die He shakes his head I can barely count the number of people in this quadrant who want you dead either as revenge against your mother or because youre just really good at pissing people off but youre still here defying the odds Shadows wrap around me and I swear I feel a caress along the side of my wounded cheek Its been rather surprising to watch actually Happy to be your entertainment Im going to bed Spinning on my heel I head toward the entrance to the barracks but hes right behind me close enough that the door would slam in his face if he wasnt so unnaturally fast at catching it Maybe if you stopped sulking in your selfpity youd see that you have everything you need to scale the Gauntlet he calls after me his voice echoing down the hallway My selfwhat I turn around my jaw dropping People die he says slowly his jaw ticking before he drags in a deep breath Its going to happen over and over again Its the nature of what happens here What makes you a rider is what you do after people die You want to know why youre still alive Because youre the scale I currently judge myself against every night Every day I let you live I get to convince myself that theres still a part of me thats a decent person So if you want to quit then please spare me the temptation and fucking quit But if you want to do something then do it Im too short to span the distance I hiss uncaring that anyone could hear us The right way isnt the only way Figure it out Then he turns and walks away Fuck Him It is a grave offense against Malek to keep the belongings of a dead loved one They belong in the beyond with the god of death and the departed In the absence of a proper temple any fire will do He who does not burn for Malek will be burned by Malek Major Rorilees Guide to Appeasing the Gods Second Edition CHAPTER ELEVEN The next practice sessions of the Gauntlet are no more successful than my first but at least we dont lose another squadmate Tynan has quit running his mouth since he cant seem to make it up fully either The buoy balls are his downfall The chimney is mine By the ninthand nexttolastsession Im ready to set the entire obstacle course on fire The section of the course thats my downfall is meant to simulate the strength and agility it takes to mount a dragon and its becoming clear that my size is going to fuck me Maybe you can climb up onto my shoulders and then Rhiannon shakes her head as we study the crevice thats become my nemesis Then Im still stuck halfway up I answer wiping the sweat from my forehead Doesnt matter You cant touch another cadet on the route Sawyer folds his arms beside me the tip of his nose now bright red from the high sun Are you here to squash hopes and dreams or do you have a suggestion Rhiannon retorts Because Presentation is tomorrow so if youve got any bright ideas now is the time If Im going to run to the Scribe Quadrant then tonight is the night My heart clenches against the thought Its the logical choice The safe choice There are only two thoughts stopping me One theres no guarantee my mother wont find out Just because Markham would keep quiet doesnt mean the instructors there will But most importantly if I go if I hideIll never know if Im good enough to make it here And while I might not survive if I stay Im not sure I can live with myself if I leave Doria Merrill Captain Fitzgibbons says from the dais Every one of his features is crystal clear not only because the sun is behind the shade of the clouds but because Im closer Our formation gets tighter with every cadet who falls According to Brennan and statistics today will be one of the deadliest for firstyears Its Presentation Day and in order to get to the flight field well have to climb the Gauntlet first Everything about the Riders Quadrant is designed to weed out the weak and today is no exception Kamryn Dyre Captain Fitzgibbons continues to read from the roll I flinch His seat was across from mine in Dragonkind Arvel Pelipa Imogen and Quinnboth secondyearssuck in a breath ahead of me Firstyears arent the only ones at risk were just the most likely to die Michel Iverem Captain Fitzgibbons closes the roll We commend their souls to Malek And with that final word formation breaks Second and thirdyears unless youre on Gauntlet duty head to class Firstyears its time to show us what youve got Dain forces a smile and skips right over me as he looks at our squad Good luck today Imogen tucks an errant strand of pink hair behind her ear and aims a sicklysweet smile right at me Hopefully you wont fallshort See you later I reply lifting my chin She stares at me with complete loathing for a second then walks off with Quinn and Cianna our executive officer her shoulderlength blond curls bouncing Best of luck Heatonthe thickest thirdyear in our squad with red flames cut and dyed into their hairtaps their heart right over two of their patches and offers us all a genuine but flatlipped smile before heading to class As I stare at their retreating back I wonder what the circular patch on their upper right arm with water and floating spheres means I know the triangular patch to the left of that one with the longsword means theyre not to be messed with on the mat Since Dain told me about the patch denoting his top secret signet Ive been paying close attention to the patches other cadets have sewn into their uniforms Most wear them like badges of honor but I recognize them for what they really areintelligence that I might one day need to defeat them I didnt realize Heaton actually knew how to speak Two lines appear between Ridocs brows Maybe they figure they should at least say hi before were potentially roasted today Rhiannon says Back into formation Dain orders Are you going with us I ask He nods still not looking at me The eight of us fall into two lines of four the same as the other squads around us Awkward Rhiannon whispers from my side He seems kind of pissed at you I glance up over Trinas slim shoulders as the breeze whips at the braid Ive woven like a crown Its working a few of Trinas ringlet curls loose too He wants something I cant give him Her eyebrows rise I roll my eyes Not likethat I wouldnt care if it was like that she replies under her breath Hes hot He has that whole boynextdoorwhocanstillkickyourass vibe going for him I fight a smile because shes right He so does Were the biggest squad Ridoc notes behind us as the squads farthest leftfrom First Wingfile out through the western gate in the courtyard What are we down to Tynan asks Hundred and eighty Hundred and seventyone Dain answers Squads from Second Wing begin to move led by their wingleader which means Xaden is somewhere ahead of us My nerves are reserved for the obstacle course but I cant help but wonder which way his scales will tip today For a hundred dragons But what will we Trina asks nerves cutting off her words Stop letting fear leach into your voice Luca snaps from behind Rhiannon If the dragons think youre a coward youll be nothing but a name tomorrow She says Ridoc narrates inducing more fear Shut up Luca fires back You know its true Just portray confidence and Im sure youll be fine I lean forward so our squadmates behind us cant hear me as Third Wing begins to march for the gate Thanks Trina whispers in reply Dains narrowed gaze finally locks on mine but at least he doesnt call me a liar Theres enough accusation in his eyes that I might as well be tried and convicted of it though Nervous Rhi I ask knowing were about to be called next For you she asks Not at all Weve got this Oh I meant about the history test tomorrow I tease Theres nothing going on today to panic about Now that you mention it the whole Treaty of Arif might just be the death of me She grins Ahh the agreement between Navarre and Krovla for mutually shared airspace for both dragons and gryphons over a narrow strip of the Esben Mountains between Sumerton and Draithus I recall nodding Your memory is terrifying She shoots me a smile But my memory isnt going to get me up the Gauntlet Fourth Wing Xaden calls out from somewhere in the distance I dont even need to see to know that its him who gave the order and not his executive officer Move out We file off Flame Section then Claw and finally Tail Theres a bit of a bottleneck at the gate but then were through walking into the magelit dimness of the tunnel that we take every morning to reach the Gauntlet Shadows blanket the edges of the rocky floor along our path What are the limits of Xadens power anyway Could he use shadows to choke out every squad in here Would he need to rest or recharge after Does such a vast power come with any sort of checks or balances Dain falls back so he walks between Rhiannon and me Change your mind Its barely a whisper No I sound way more confident than I feel Change Your Mind His hand finds mine concealed by our tight formation as we descend through the passage Please I cant I shake my head Any more than you would leave Cath and run to the scribes yourself Thats different His hand squeezes mine and I can feel the tension in his fingers his arm Im a rider Well maybe I am too I whisper as light appears ahead I didnt believe it before not when I couldnt leave because my mother wouldnt let me but now I have a choice And I choose to stay Dont be He cuts himself off and drops my hand I dont want to bury you Vi Its inevitable that one of us will have to bury the other Its not macabre just fact You know what I mean The light grows into an archway thats ten feet high leading us to the base of the Gauntlet Please dont do this Dain begs not bothering to lower his voice this time as we emerge into the mottled sunlight The view is spectacular as always Were still high on the mountain thousands of feet above the valley and the greenery seems to stretch endlessly to the south with random clusters of squat trees among colorful slopes of wildflowers My gaze turns to the Gauntlet carved into the face of the cliff and I cant help but follow each obstacle higher and higher until Im staring at the top of the ridgeline that the maps Ive studied show leads into a box canyonthe flight field I bite my lip as I stare at the break in the tree line Normally only riders are allowed on the flight fieldexcept for Presentation I dont know if I can watch Dain says drawing my attention back to his strong face His perfectly trimmed beard brackets full lips drawn tight into a frown Then close your eyes I have a plana shitty one but its worth a try What changed between Parapet and now Dain asks again a wealth of emotions in his eyes that I cant begin to interpret Well except the fear That doesnt need any interpretation Me An hour later my feet fly over the spinning posts of the staircase and I jump to the safety of the gravel path Third ascent complete Two more to go And I havent touched a single rope I swear I can feel Dain staring from the bottom of the course where Tynan and Luca have yet to start their climb but I dont look down Theres no time for what he thinks will be one last look and I cant afford the delay of comforting him when there are still two obstacles ahead of me Which means theres one I havent even had the chance to practicethe nearly vertical ramp at the end You can do it Rhiannon yells from the top as I reach the chimney structure Or you can do us all a favor and fall another voice yells Jack no doubt At least its only been our squad at practice sessions but every firstyear can watch now either from the base of the course or the edges of the cliff above I look up at the hollow column Im supposed to climb then dart back a few feet along the path What are you doing Rhiannon shouts as I grab one of the ropes and drag it horizontally across the surface of the cliff sending pebbles into free fall Its heavy as hell and protests the stretch but I manage to get the bottom portion onto the chimney structure Pulling the rope as tight as it can go I plant one foot on the side of the shaft and give the rope a tug then send up a prayer to Zihnal that this is going to work Can she do that someone snaps Im doing it now Then I lift my other foot and begin to climb up the chimney using only the right side walking up stone and leveraging my weight with the rope hand over hand The line slips about halfway up as the rope scrapes over a large boulder but I quickly take up the slack and keep climbing My heart thunders in my ears but its my hands that are killing me It feels like flames are eating my palms and I grit my teeth so I dont cry out There it is The top The rope barely cuts the corner of the structure now and I use whats left of my upperbody strength to pull myself up scrambling to my hands and knees on the path Hell yes Ridoc yells hooting from the top Thats our girl Get up Rhiannon shouts One more My chest heaves and my lungs ache but I make it to my feet Im on the last ascent the final path to the flight field and standing in front of me is a ramp made of wood that juts out ten feet from the cliff wall then curves upward like the inside of a bowl the highest point level with the cliff top ten feet above The obstacle is meant to test a cadets ability to scale a dragons foreleg and reach its saddle And Im too short But Xadens words that the right way wasnt the only way have played over and over in my head all night long By the time the sun rose and chased away the darkness I had a plan I only hope I can actually pull it off I unsheathe my largest dagger from home and wipe away the sweat on my forehead with the back of my dirty palm Then I forget the agony in my hands the throbbing of my shoulders and the twinge in my knee from landing wrong after the pillars I block out all the pain lock it behind a wall like Ive done my entire life and focus on the ramp as though my life depends on making it Theres no rope here Theres only one way Im getting over this Sheer fucking will And so I charge using my speed to my advantage Theres a drumlike sound as my feet beat against the ramp and the incline sharpens Just because I havent personally conquered this obstacle doesnt mean I havent watched my squadmates take it over and over again I throw my body forward and momentum carries me upward running up the side of the ramp I wait until I feel the precious shift the moment gravity reclaims my body almost two feet from the top and I swing my arm up and slam my dagger into the slick soft wood of the rampand use it to fling myself the last foot upward A primal scream rips from my throat as my shoulder cries in protest just as my fingers graze the lip of the edge I throw my elbow over the top to gain more leverage and pull myself up and over using the handle of my dagger as a final step before lurching onto the top of the cliff Not done yet On my stomach I turn to face the ramp then reach over the side and yank my dagger free sheathing it at my ribs before I stagger to my feet I made it Relief sucks the adrenaline straight out of my body Rhiannons arms sweep around me taking my weight as I gasp for air Ridoc hugs my back squeezing me like Im the filling of a sandwich as he hollers in happiness Id protest but right now theyre all thats keeping me upright She cant do that someone shouts Yeah well she just did Ridoc tosses over his shoulder loosening his grip on me My knees shake but they hold as I suck in breath after breath You made it Rhiannon takes my face in her hands tears filling her brown eyes You made it Luck I draw in another breath and beg my galloping heart to slow And Adrenaline Cheating I turn toward the voice Its Amber Mavis the strawberryblond wingleader from Third Wing who was Dains close friend last year and theres nothing but fury on her face as she charges toward Xaden whos only a couple of feet away with the roll recording times with a stopwatch and looking rather bored with it all Back the hell up Mavis Garrick threatens the sun flashing off the two swords the curlyhaired section leader keeps strapped to his back as he puts his body between Amber and Xaden The cheater clearly used foreign materials not once but twice Amber yells Its not to be tolerated We live by the rules or we die by them No wonder she and Dain are so closetheyre both in love with the Codex I dont take kindly to calling anyone in my section a cheater Garrick warns his massive shoulders blocking her from view as he turns And my wingleader will handle any rulebreaking in his own wing He moves to the side and Im met with Ambers glaring blue eyes Sorrengail Xaden asks arching an eyebrow in obvious challenge a pen poised over the book I notice not for the first time that other than his Fourth Wing and wingleader emblems he doesnt wear the patches others are so fond of displaying I expect the thirtysecond penalty for using the rope I answer my breaths steadying And the knife Ambers gaze narrows Shes disqualified When Xaden doesnt answer she turns that glare on him Surely shes out You cant tolerate lawlessness within your own wing Riorson But Xadens gaze never leaves mine as he silently waits for me to respond A rider may only bring to the quadrant the items they can carry I start Are you quoting the Codex to me Amber shouts and they shall not be separated from those items no matter what they may be I continue For once carried across the parapet they are considered part of their person Article Three Section Six Addendum B Her blue eyes flare wide as I glance at her That addendum was written to make thievery an executional offense Correct I nod looking between her and the onyx eyes that see straight through me But in doing so it gave any item carried across the parapet the status of being a part of the rider I unsheathe the chipped and battered blade with a sharp bite of pain in my palms This isnt a challenge blade Its one I carried across and therefore considered part of myself His eyes flare and I dont miss the hint of a smirk on that infuriatingly decadent mouth of his It should be against the Codex to look that good and be so ruthless The right way isnt the only way I use his own words against him Xaden holds my gaze She has you Amber On a technicality She still has you He turns slightly and delivers a look that I never want directed at me You think like a scribe she barks at me Its intended as an insult but I just nod I know She marches off and I sheathe the dagger again letting my hands fall to my sides and closing my eyes as relief shucks the weight from my shoulders I did it I passed another test Sorrengail Xaden says and my eyes fly open Youre leaking His gaze drops pointedly to my hands Where blood is dripping from my fingertips Pain erupts pushing past my mental dam like a raging river at the sight of the mess Ive made of my palms Ive shredded them Do something about it he orders I nod and back away joining my squad Rhiannon helps me cut off the sleeves of my shirt to bandage my hands and I cheer our last two squadmates up the cliff We all make it Presentation Day is unlike any other The air is ripe with possibilities and possibly the stench of sulfur from a dragon who has been offended Never look a red in the eye Never back down from a green If you show trepidation to a brownwell just dont Colonel Kaoris Field Guide to Dragonkind CHAPTER TWELVE There are 169 of us by the time the morning is done and even with my penalty for the rope weve placed eleventh out of the thirtysix squads for Presentationthe pissinducing parade of cadets before this years dragons willing to bond Anxiety seizes my legs at the thought of walking so close to dragons determined to weed out the weak before Threshing and I suddenly wish wed placed last The fastest up the Gauntlet was Liam Mairi of course earning him the Gauntlet patch Pretty sure that guy doesnt know how to take second place but I wasnt the slowest and thats good enough for me The box canyon that makes up the training field is spectacular in the afternoon sun with miles of autumncolored meadows and peaks rising on three sides of us as we wait at the narrowest part the entrance to the valley At the end I can make out the line of the waterfall that might be just a trickle of a creek now but will rush at runoff season The leaves of the trees are all turning gold as though someone has brought in a paintbrush with only one color and streaked it across the landscape And then there are the dragons Averaging twentyfive feet tall theyre in a formation of their own lined up several feet back from the pathclose enough to pass judgment on us as we walk by Lets go Second Squad youre up next Garrick says beckoning us with a wave that makes the rebellion relic on his bared forearm gleam Dain and the other squad leaders stayed behind Im not sure if hell be thrilled I made it up the Gauntlet or disappointed that I bent the rules But Ive never felt more thrilled Into formation Garrick orders his tone all business which doesnt surprise me given that his leadership style is more mission first niceties last Go figure he seems to be so close to Xaden Unlike Xaden though the right side of his uniform has a neat line of patches proclaiming him Flames section leader as well as more than five patches advertising his skill with a multitude of weapons We comply and Rhiannon and I end up near the back this time Theres a sound like rushing wind in the distance that stops as quickly as it starts and I know someone else has been found lacking Garricks hazel eyes skim over us Hopefully Aetos has done his job so you know that its a straight walk down the meadow Id recommend staying at least seven feet apart In case one of us gets torched Ridoc mutters from ahead Correct Ridoc Cluster if you want just know if a dragon finds disfavor with one of you its likely to burn the whole lot to weed one out Garrick warns holding our gazes for a beat Also remember youre not here to approach them and if you do you wont be making it back to the dormitory tonight Can I ask a question Luca says from the front row Garrick nods but the ticking of his jaw says hes annoyed I cant blame him Luca annoys the shit out of me too Its her constant need to tear everyone down that makes most of us keep our distance Third Squad Tail Section of Fourth Wing already went through and I talked to some of the cadets Thats not a question He lifts his brows Yep hes annoyed Right Its just that they said theres a feathertail Her voice pitches upward A ffeathertail Tynan sputters from directly in front of me Who the hell would ever want to bond a feathertail I roll my eyes and Rhiannon shakes her head Professor Kaori never told us there would be a feathertail Sawyer says I know because I memorized every single dragon he showed us All hundred of them Well guess theres a hundred and one now Garrick replies looking at us as if were children hed like to be rid of before glancing back over his shoulder at the entrance to the valley Relax Feathertails dont bond I cant even remember the last time one has been seen outside the Vale Its probably just curious Youre up Stay on the path You walk up you wait for the entire squad you walk back down It really doesnt get any easier than this from here on out kids so if you cant follow those simple instructions then you deserve whatever happens in there He turns and heads over to a path before the canyon wall where the dragons are perched We follow breaking away from the crowd of firstyears The breeze bites at my bare shoulders from where we ripped my sleeves for bandages but we got the blood flow stopped at my hands Theyre all yours Garrick says to the quadrants senior wingleader a woman Ive seen a few times in Battle Brief murmuring to Xaden Her uniform still has her signature spikes on the shoulders but this time theyre gold and look sharp as helllike she wanted to throw in a little extra badass today She nods and dismisses him Single file We all shuffle into a line Rhiannon is at my back and Tynan just ahead of me which means Ill be treated to his commentary the whole time no doubt Awesome Talk the senior wingleader says folding her arms across her chest Nice day for a Presentation Ridoc jokes Not to me The senior wingleader narrows her gaze on Ridoc then motions to the line of cadets before her Talk to your nearby squadmates while youre on the path as it will help the dragons get a sense of who you are and how well you play with others Theres a correlation between bonded cadets and level of chatter And now I want to switch places Feel free to look at the dragons especially if theyre showing off their tails but I would abstain from eye contact if you value your life If you come across a scorch mark just make sure nothings currently on fire before continuing along She pauses long enough for that bit of advice to sink in then adds See you after your stroll With a sweep of her hand the senior wingleader steps to the side revealing the dirt path that leads through the center of the valley and up ahead sitting so perfectly still that they might be gargoyles are the hundred and one dragons who have decided to bond this year The line starts and we give one another the suggested seven feet before following Im hyperaware of every step as I walk down the path The trail is hard beneath my boots and theres a definite lingering odor of sulfur We pass a trio of red dragons first Their talons are almost half my size I cant even see their tails Tynan shouts from in front of me How are we supposed to know what breed they are I keep my eyes locked at the level of their massive muscled shoulders as we walk by Were not supposed to know what breed they are I respond Fuck that he says over his shoulder I need to figure out which one Im going to approach during Threshing Pretty sure this little walk is so they can decide I retort Hopefully one of them will decide you dont get to make it to Threshing Rhiannon says her voice quiet so it barely reaches me I laugh as we approach a set of browns both slightly smaller than my mothers Aimsir but not by much Theyre a little bigger than I thought they would be Rhiannon says her voice rising Not that I didnt see the ones at Parapet but I look over my shoulder to see her wide gaze flickering between the path and the dragons Shes nervous So do you know if youre having a niece or nephew I ask continuing to walk forward past a handful of oranges What she answers Ive heard some of the healers can make pretty good guesses once a woman is further along in her pregnancy Oh No she says No clue Though Im kind of hoping shell have a girl I guess Ill find out once we finish the year and can write our families Thats a bullshit rule I say over my shoulder lowering my gaze immediately when I accidentally make eye contact with one of the oranges Breathe normally Swallow the fear Fear and weakness will get me killed and since Im already bleeding the odds arent exactly in my favor here You dont think it encourages loyalty to the wing Rhiannon asks I think Im just as loyal to my sister whether Ive had a letter from her or not I counter There are bonds that cant be broken Id be loyal to your sister too Tynan says turning around and grinning as he walks backward Shes one hell of a rider and that ass I saw her right before Parapet and damn Violet Shes hot We pass by another set of reds then a single brown and a pair of greens Turn around I make the spinning motion with my finger Mira would eat you for breakfast Tynan Im just wondering how one of you got all the good traits and the other looks like she got the leftovers His gaze skims down my body Fullbodyshudder gross Youre an asshole I flip him the middle finger Just saying maybe Ill write a letter of my own once we get privileges He turns and continues walking A nephew would be good Rhiannon says like the conversation was never interrupted Boys arent too bad My brother was awesome but he and Dain are my only experience with growing up around little boys We pass more dragons and my breathing starts to settle The smell of sulfur disappears or maybe Ive just grown accustomed to it Theyre close enough to torch us the half dozen singe marks testify to that but I cant hear them breathing or feel it either Though I think Dain was probably a little more ruleabiding than most kids He likes order and pretty much detests anything that doesnt fit neatly into his plan Hes probably going to give me shit about how I got up the Gauntlet just like Amber Mavis did We pass the halfway mark and continue Is the way the dragons stare at us scary as hell Absolutely but they want to be here the same as we do so at least I hope theyll be judicious with their firepower Why didnt you tell me about the rope plan Or the dagger Rhiannon asks hurt pitching her tone You can trust me you know I didnt think of it until yesterday I answer taking the time to look over my shoulder so I can see her And if it didnt work I didnt want you to be an accomplice You have a real future here and I refuse to bring you down with me if I didnt make it I dont need you to protect me I know But its just what friends do Rhi I shrug as we walk by a trio of browns the soft crunch of our boots on the dark gravel path the only sound for a few minutes You keeping any other secrets up there Rhiannon eventually asks Guilt settles in my stomach when I think of Xaden and his meeting with the other marked ones I think its impossible to know everything there is to know about someone I feel like shit but keep from lying at least She snorts a laugh If that wasnt skirting the question How about this Promise me that if you need help youll let me give it to you A smile spreads across my face despite the terrifying greens were walking by How about this I toss over my shoulder I promise that if I need help youre capable of giving Ill ask but onlyI hold up my forefingerif you promise the same Deal She smiles wide You guys done bonding back there Tynan sneers Because were almost to the end of the line if you havent noticed He pauses in the middle of the path his gaze swinging right And I still cant figure out which one Im going to choose With arrogance like that Im sure any dragon would feel lucky to share your mind for the rest of your life I pity whatever dragonif anychooses him The rest of the squad is gathered ahead of us facing our direction at the end of the path but all their attention is focused to the right We pass the last brown dragon and I inhale sharply What the hell Tynan stares Keep walking I order but my gaze is transfixed Standing at the end of the line is a small golden dragon Sunlight reflects off its scales and horns as it stands to its full height flicking a feathered tail around the side of its body The feathertail My jaw drops as I take in the sharp teeth and quick darting movements of its head as it studies us At its full height its probably only a few feet taller than I am like a perfect miniature of the brown next to it I walk straight into Tynans back and startle Weve reached the end of the path where the rest of the squad has been waiting Get off me Sorrengail Tynan hisses and shoves me back Who the hell would bond that thing My chest tightens They can hear you I remind him Its fucking yellow Luca points right at the dragon disgust curling her lip So not only is it obviously too small to carry a rider in battle but its not even powerful enough to be a real color Maybe its a mistake Sawyer says quietly Maybe its a baby orange Its full grown Rhiannon argues Theres no way the other dragons allow a baby to bond No human alive has ever seen a baby Its a mistake all right Tynan looks at the golden one and scoffs You should totally bond it Sorrengail Youre both freakishly weak Its a match made in heaven It looks powerful enough to burn you to death I counter heat flushing my cheeks He called me weak and not just in front of our squad but in front of them Sawyer lunges between us grabbing Tynans collar Dont ever say that about a squadmate especially not in front of unbonded dragons Let him gohes just saying what were all thinking Luca mutters I turn slowly to stare at her my mouth slightly agape Is this what happens to us the second were out of hearing range of any superior cadet We turn on one another What She gestures to my hair Half your hair is silver and yourepetite she finishes with a fake smile Golden andsmall You match Trina puts her hand on Sawyers arm Dont make a mistake in front of them We dont know what theyll do she whispers And now were grouped up I shuffle backward a little as Sawyer drops Tynans collar Someone should kill it before it bonds Tynan sputters and for the first time in my life I actually want to kick someone while theyre downand keep kicking until they stay down Its just going to get its rider killed and its not like we get a choice if it wants to bond us Youre just picking up on that now are you Ridoc shakes his head We should go back Pryor says his gaze darting around the group I meanif you think we should We dont have to of course For once in your life Tynan says pushing past Pryor to start down the path make a damn decision Pryor We take off one by one leaving the suggested space between us Rhiannon goes before me this time and Ridoc follows behind with Luca bringing up the rear Theyre pretty incredible arent they Ridoc says and the wonder in his voice makes me smile They are I agree Theyre honestly a little underwhelming after seeing that blue at Parapet Lucas voice carries all the way to Rhiannon who turns around with an incredulous look Like this isnt stressful enough without you insulting them Rhi asks I need to defuse this quickly I mean it could be worse We could be walking past a line of wyvern right Oh please Violet do give us one of your nervousbabble story times Luca says sarcastically Let me guess Wyvern are some elite squad of gryphon riders created because of something we did at a battle only you can manage to remember with your scribe brain You dont know what a wyvern is Rhi asks then begins walking again Didnt your parents tell you bedtime stories Luca Do enlighten me Luca drawls I roll my eyes continuing along the path Theyre folklore I say over my shoulder Kind of like dragons but bigger with two feet instead of four a mane of razorsharp feathers streaking down their necks and a taste for humans Unlike dragons who think were a little gamey My mom used to love telling my sister Raegan and me that wed be plucked right off the front porch by one if we talked back and their eerieeyed venin riders would take us prisoner if we took treats we werent allowed to have Rhi says flashing a grin at me and I cant help but notice that her step is lighter Mine is too I notice each dragon as we pass but my heartbeat steadies My dad used to read to me those fables every night I tell her And I seriously asked him one time if Mom was going to turn into a venin because she could channel Rhiannon chuckles as we walk by a set of glaring reds Did he tell you people supposedly only turn into venin if they channel directly from the source He did but it was after my mom had a really long night while we were stationed near the eastern border and her eyes were bloodshot red so I freaked out and started shrieking I cant help but smile at the memory She took my book of fables away for a month because the outpost guards all came running and I was hiding behind my brother who couldnt stop laughing and wellit was a mess I keep my eyes front and center as a large orange sniffs the air when I pass Rhiannons shoulders shake with laughter I wish wed had a book like that I seriously think Mom just altered the stories to scare us whenever we stepped out of line That sounds like some bordervillage nonsense Luca scoffs Venin Wyvern Anyone with a modicum of education knows that our wards stop all magic that isnt channeled directly from dragons Theyre stories Luca Rhi says over her shoulder and I cant help but notice how much ground weve covered Pryor you can walk a little faster if you want up there Maybe we should slow down and take our time Pryor suggests from ahead of Rhiannon rubbing his palms along the sides of his uniform Or I guess we can go faster if we want to get out of here A red steps out of line putting one claw forward toward us and my stomach drops to the ground from the weight of the dread filling my entire body No no no I whisper freezing in place but its too late The red opens its mouth exposing sharp glistening fangs and fire erupts along the sides of its tongue streaming through the air and into the path ahead of Rhiannon She yells in shock Heat blasts the front of my face Then its over The scent of sulfur and burned grassburnedsomething fills my lungs and I see a charred patch of ground in front of Rhiannon that hadnt been there before Are you all right Rhi I call forward She nods but the movement is hurried and jerky Pryor is Hes Pryors dead My mouth waters like Im going to vomit but I breathe in through my nose and out through my mouth until the feeling passes Keep walking Sawyer shouts from farther down the path Its all right Rhi You just have to She just has to what Walk over his corpse Is there a corpse Fires out Rhiannon says over her shoulder I nod because theres nothing I can say to reassure her Holy shit are we insignificant She walks forward and I follow maneuvering around the pile of ash that used to be Pryor Oh my gods the smell Luca complains Could you please have some level of decency I snap turning around to level a glare at her but Ridocs face makes me pause His eyes are as wide as saucers and his mouth hangs open Violet Its a whisper and I wonder briefly if I heard him as much as I saw the word forming on his lips Vi A warm huff of steam blows against the back of my neck My heart thunders the beat increasing erratically as I take what might be my last breath and turn toward the line of dragons The golden eyes of not one but two greens meet mine consuming my field of vision Oh Fuck To approach a green dragon lower your eyes in supplication and wait for their approval Thats what I read right I drop my gaze as one chuffs another breath at me Its hot and appallingly wet but Im not dead yet so thats a plus The one on the right chortles deep in its throat Wait is that the sound of approval Im looking for Shit I wish Id asked Mira Mira Shes going to be devastated when she reads the rolls I lift my head and suck in a sharp breath Theyre even closer The one on the left nudges my hands with its giant nose but I somehow stand my ground rocking back on my heels to keep from falling over Greens are the most reasonable I cut my hands climbing the obstacle course I lift my palms like they can see through the black fabric binding my wounds The one on the right sets its nose right at my breasts and chuffs again What The Hell It inhales making that noise in its throat and the other shoves its nose into my ribs making me raise my arms just in case they feel like taking a little nibble Violet Rhiannon whispershouts Im all right I call back then wince hoping I didnt just seal my fate by screaming in their ears Another chuff Another chortle like theyre talking to each other as they sniff me The one under my arm moves its nostrils to my back and sniffs again Realization hits and I choke out a tight surreal laugh You smell Teine dont you I ask quietly They both draw back just far enough for me to look them in their golden eyes but they keep their jaws shut giving me the courage to keep talking Im Miras sister Violet Slowly lowering my arms I run my hands over my snotcovered vest and the armor carefully sewn into it She collected Teines scales after he shed them last year and had them shrunk down so she could sew them into the vest to help keep me safe The one on the right blinks The one on the left sticks its nose in again sniffing loudly The scales have saved me a few times I whisper But no one else knows theyre in there Just Mira and Teine They both blink at me and I lower my gaze bowing my head because it feels like the thing to do Professor Kaori taught us every way to approach a dragon and exactly zero ways to disengage one Step by step they retreat until I see them take up their places in line in my peripherals and I finally raise my head Taking several deep breaths I try to lock my muscles to keep from trembling Violet Rhiannon is only a few feet away a look of terror in her eyes She must have been right behind their heads Im fine I force a smile and nod I have dragonscale armor under the vest I whisper They smell my sisters dragon If she wants trust there it is Please dont tell anyone I wont she whispers Youre all right Other than having a few years of my life shaved off I laugh The sound is shaky bordering on hysteria Lets get out of here She swallows her gaze darting toward the line of dragons Good idea She turns and walks back to her place and once theres fifteen feet between us I follow I think I just shat myself Ridoc says and my laughter only pitches higher as we move through the field Honestly I thought they were going to eat you Luca remarks Me too I admit I wouldnt have blamed them she continues Youre insufferable Ridoc calls back I focus on the path and keep walking What Shes obviously our weakest link after Pryor and I dont blame them for snuffing him out she argues He could never make a decision and no one wants someone like that as their rider A blast of heat singes my back and I halt Dont be Ridoc Dont be Guess the dragons think shes insufferable too Ridoc mutters Our squad is down to six firstyears There is nothing quite as humbling or as aweinspiring as witnessing Threshingfor those who live through it anyway Colonel Kaoris Field Guide to Dragonkind CHAPTER THIRTEEN October first is always Threshing Monday Wednesday or Sunday it doesnt matter where it falls on any given year On the first of October the firstyear cadets of the Riders Quadrant enter the bowlshaped forested valley to the southwest of the citadel and pray they come out alive I will not die today I didnt bother eating this morning and I pity Ridoc whos currently heaving up the contents of his stomach against a tree to my right A sword is strapped to Rhiannons back the hilt jostling against her spine as she bounces stretching her arms across her chest one at a time Remember to listen here Professor Kaori says from in front of the 147 of us here tapping his chest If a dragon has already selected you theyll be calling He thumps his chest again So pay attention to not just your surroundings but your feelings and go with them He grimaces And if your feelings are telling you to go in the other directionlisten to that too Which one are you going for Rhiannon asks quietly I dont know I shake my head but cant ditch the feeling of absolute failure in my chest At this point Mira knew she wanted to seek out Teine You memorized the cards right she asks lifting her brows So you know whats out there Yes I just dont feel connected to any of them Which is better than feeling connected to a dragon another rider has their eye on I have no desire to fight to the death today Dain tried talking me into a brown Dain lost his vote when he tried talking you into leaving she counters Theres a lot of truth to that Ive only talked to him once in the past two days since Presentation and he tried to get me to run within the first five minutes Weve only seen professors this morning but I know the second and thirdyear riders are scattered throughout this valley in order to observe What about you She grins Im thinking about that green The one closest to me when they got all up close and personal with you Well it didnt eat you so thats a promising start I smile despite the fear racing through my veins I think so too She links her arm with mine and I focus back on what Professor Kaori is telling us If you go in groups youre more likely to be incinerated than bonded Professor Kaori argues with someone near the center of the valley The scribes have run the statistics Youre better off on your own And what if we arent chosen by dinner a man with a short beard to my left asks Looking past him I catch Jack Barlowe running a finger across his neck at me So original Then Oren and Tynan flank his sides So much for squad loyalty Its everyone for themselves today If youre not chosen by nightfall theres a problem Professor Kaori responds his thick mustache turned down at the ends Youll be brought out by a professor or senior leadership so dont give up and think weve forgotten about you He checks his pocket watch Remember to spread out and use every foot of this valley to your advantage Its nine which means they should be flying in any minute now The only other words I have for you are good luck He nods sweeping his gaze over the crowd of us with such intensity that I know hell be able to recreate this moment in a projection Then he leaves marching up the hill to our right and disappearing into the trees My mind whirls Its time Ill either leave this forest as a rideror likely never leave Be careful Rhiannon pulls me into a hug her braids swinging over my shoulder as she tightens her arms around me You too I squeeze her back and am immediately swept into another pair of arms Dont die Ridoc orders Thats our only goal as whats left of our squad separates each heading in our own direction like weve been flung apart by centrifugal motion at the mercy of a spinning wheel Guessing by the position of the sun its been at least a couple of hours since the dragons flew overhead landing in the valley in a succession that sounded like thunder and making the earth shake Ive come across two greens a brown four oranges and My heart stumbles and my feet freeze to the forest floor as a red steps into my field of vision its head just under the canopy of enormous trees This is not my dragon Im not sure how I know but I do I hold my breath trying not to make a sound as its head sweeps right then left and my gaze plummets to the ground as I bow my head For the last hour or so Ive seen dragons launch into the air with a cadetnow a rideron their back but Ive also seen more than a couple of plumes of smoke and I have no desire to be one of those The dragon huffs a breath then continues along its path its clubtail flicking upward and catching one of the lowerhanging branches The limb falls to the ground with a monstrous crash and only after the footsteps recede do I finally raise my head Ive now come across every color of dragon and none of them has spoken to me or given me the sense of connection were reportedly supposed to feel My stomach sinks What if Im one of the cadets whos destined to never become a rider One whos thrown back time and again to restart first year until eventually something puts me on the death roll Has this all been for nothing The thought is too heavy to carry Maybe if I could just see the valley then Id get a feeling like Professor Kaori was talking about I spot the nearest climbable tree and get to work scaling branch after branch Pain radiates from my hands but I dont let it distract me The bark catching the wraps that still cover my palms Now thats an annoyance that makes me pause every few feet and pull the cloth free of the bark Pretty sure the higher branches arent going to support my weight so I stop about threequarters to the top and survey the immediate area There are a few greens in plain sight to my left standing out against the fall foliage Oddly enough this is the one time of year when oranges browns and reds have the highest chance of blending in I watch the trees for movement and spot a couple more directly south but theres no pull no aching need to head in that direction which probably means those arent mine either Relief hits me embarrassingly hard when I count at least half a dozen firstyears wandering aimlessly I shouldnt be so happy that they havent found their dragons either but at least Im not the only one which gives me hope Theres a clearing to the north and my eyes narrow as a flash like a mirror catches the sun Or like a golden dragon Guess the little feathertail is still out here appeasing its curiosity But Im apparently not going to find my dragon up a tree so I climb down carefully and as quietly as possible My feet hit the ground just before voices approach and I tuck myself against the trunk to hide from being seen Were not supposed to be in groups Im telling you I think I saw it headed this way Its a cocky voice I immediately recognize as Tynan Youd better be right because if we just hiked all the way the fuck over here just to find nothing Im going to run you through My stomach twists Its Jack No one elses voice has that physical effect on me not even Xadens You sure we shouldnt be spending our time looking for our own dragons instead of hunting the freak down Recognition tickles the edges of my mind but I lean out from my hiding place just to be sure Yep its Oren I dart back behind the cover of the tree as the trio passes each strapped with a deadly sword There are nine daggers tucked against my body in various places so its not like Im unarmed but I feel tragically disadvantaged by my inability to wield a sword effectively Theyre just too damned heavy Waitwhat did they say they were doing Hunting Its not like our dragons are going to bond other riders Jack snaps Theyll wait for us This has to be done That scrawny one is going to get someone killed We have to take it out Nausea swirls in my stomach and my fingernails bite into my palms Theyre going to try and kill the little golden one If we get caught were fucked Oren comments Thats an understatement I cant imagine dragons would take kindly to killing one of their own but they seem to be focused on culling the weak from the herd in our species so its not a stretch to imagine they do the same with their own Then youd better shut your mouth so no one hears us Tynan counters his voice rising in that mocking tone that makes me want to punch him in the face Its for the best Jack argues his tone dropping Its unrideable a certified freak and you know feathertails are useless in combat They refuse to fight His voice fades as they walk farther away headed north Toward the clearing Shit I mutter under my breath even though the assholes are out of hearing range by now No one knows anything about feathertails so I dont know where Jack is getting his information but I dont have time to focus on his assumptions right now I have no way of contacting Professor Kaori and there hasnt even been a hint that the senior riders are watching us so I cant count on them to stop this madness either The golden dragon should be able to breathe fire but what if it cant Theres a chance they wont find it but Shit I cant even convince myself of that one Theyre headed the right way and that dragon is pretty much a shiny beacon Theyll find it My shoulders sag and I sigh at the sky blowing out a frustrated breath I cant just stand here and do nothing You can get there first and warn it Solid plan and way better than option two where Id be forced to take on three armed men with at least a combined two hundred pounds on me I keep my footsteps silent and race across the forest floor at a slightly different angle than Jacks little posse thankful I grew up playing hideandseek with Dain in the woods This is one area of expertise I can confidently claim Theyve got a head start on me and the clearing is closer than I realized so I kick up my speed my gaze darting between the leafcovered path Ive chosen and where I thinkscratch that where I know they are toward the left I can make out their lumbering shapes in the distance I hear a pop and the ground falls out from under me then rushes for my face My hands fly out to brace myself a second before I slam into the forest floor I bite into my lower lip to keep from crying out as my ankle screams Popping isnt good Its never good Glancing back I curse at the fallen branch hidden by fall foliage thats just wrecked my ankle Shit Block the pain Block it But theres no mental trick to keep the shooting agony from turning my stomach as I drag myself to my knees and rise carefully keeping my weight on my left ankle Theres nothing to do but limp the final dozen feet to the clearing gritting my teeth the whole way The tinge of satisfaction that I beat Jack here is almost enough to make me smile The meadow is big enough for ten dragons ringed by several large trees but the golden one stands alone in the center like its trying to get a suntan Its just as beautiful as I remember but unless it can breathe fire its a sitting duck You have to get out of here I hiss from the cover of the trees knowing it should be able to hear me Theyre going to kill you if you dont leave Its head pivots toward me then tilts at an angle that makes my own neck hurt Yes I whisper loudly You Goldie It blinks its golden eyes and swishes its tail You have to be fucking kidding me Go Run Fly I shoo at it then remember its a godsdamned dragon capable of shredding me with its claws alone and drop my hands This is not going well Its going the opposite of well The trees rustle from the south and Jack steps into the clearing his sword swaying in his right hand A step later hes flanked by Oren and Tynan both their weapons drawn Shit I mutter my chest tightening This is now officially going horribly The golden dragons head snaps in their direction a low growl rumbling in its chest Well make it painless Jack promises like that makes the murder acceptable Scorch them I whispershout my heart pounding as they draw closer But the dragon doesnt and somehow Im certain in the marrow of my bones that it cant Other than its teeth its defenseless against three trained warriors Its going to die just because its smaller weaker than the other dragonsjust like me My throat closes The dragon backs up its growl growing louder as it bares its teeth Stomach pitching I have that Parapet feeling againwhatever I do next has overwhelming odds of ending my life And yet Im still going to do it because this is wrong You cant do this I take the first step into the shinhigh grass and Jacks attention swings my way My ankle has a heartbeat of its own and agony streaks up my spine chattering my teeth as I force my weight onto my ruined joint so they wont see me limping They cant know Im hurt or theyll just attack faster One at a time I stand a chance of holding them off long enough for the dragon to escape but together Dont think about it Oh look Jack grins pointing his sword my way We can take out both the weakest links at the same time He looks at his friends and laughs pausing their advance Each step hurts worse than the last but I make it to the center of the clearing putting myself between Jacks group and the golden dragon Been waiting a long time for this Sorrengail He walks forward slowly If you can fly now would be a good time I shout over my shoulder at the small dragon drawing two daggers from the sheaths at my ribs The dragon chuffs So helpful You cant kill a dragon I try reasoning shaking my head at the trio fear lacing my veins with adrenaline Sure we can Jack shrugs but Oren looks a little uncertain so I pin my gaze on him as they spread out slightly about a dozen feet away setting up the perfect formation for an attack You cant I say directly to Oren It goes against everything we believe in He flinches Jack doesnt Letting something so weak so incapable of fighting live is against our beliefs Jack shouts and I know hes not just talking about the dragon Youre going to have to get through me then My heart thunders against my ribs as I raise my daggers flipping one to pinch the tip so Im ready to throw and measuring the twenty or so feet separating me from my attackers I dont really consider that a problem Jack snarls They all lift their swords and I draw a deep breath readying myself to fight This isnt the mat There are no instructors No yielding Nothing to stop them slaughtering meslaughtering us I would strongly recommend you rethink your actions a voicehis voicedemands from across the field to my right My scalp prickles as each of our heads swivel in his direction Xaden is leaning against the tree his arms folded across his chest and behind him watching with narrowed golden eyes her fangs exposed is Sgaeyl his terrifying navyblue daggertail In the six centuries of recorded history of dragon and rider there have been hundreds of known cases where a dragon simply can not emotionally recover from the loss of their bonded rider This happens when the bond is particularly strong and in three documented cases has even caused the untimely death of the dragon Navarre an Unedited History by Colonel Lewis Markham CHAPTER FOURTEEN Xaden For the first time the sight of him fills my chest with hope He wont let this happen He might hate me but hes a wingleader He cant just watch them kill a dragon But I know the rules probably better than anyone else in this quadrant He has to Bile rises in my throat and I tilt my chin to quell the burning What Xaden wants which is always debatable doesnt matter here He can only observe not interfere Im going to have an audience for my death Fantastic So much for hope And if we dont want to rethink our actions Jack shouts Xaden looks toward me and I swear I can see his jaw clench even from this far away Hope is a fickle dangerous thing It steals your focus and aims it toward the possibilities instead of keeping it where it belongson the probabilities Xadens words come back to me with alarming clarity and I rip my gaze from his and concentrate on the three probabilities in front of me Theres nothing you can do right Wingleader Jack bellows Guess he knows the rules too Its not me you should worry about today Xaden responds and Sgaeyl tilts her head nothing but menace in her eyes when I glance over You really going to do this I ask Tynan Attack a squadmate Squads dont mean shit today he seethes menace curling his lips into a sinister smile So I guess thats a no on the flying I toss over my shoulder again and the golden dragon chuffs low in its throat in response Great Well if you can back me up with those claws Id really appreciate it It chuffs twice and I spare a glance down at its claws Or should I saypaws Oh fucking hell You dont have any claws I turn back to the three men just as Jack roars a battle cry and sprints toward me I dont hesitate I whip my blade across the rapidly closing space between us and the dagger finds its mark in the shoulder of his sword arm His sword falls as he hits his knees crying out this time in pain Good But Oren and Tynan have charged at the same time and theyre almost on me I fling my second dagger at Tynan and catch him in the thigh slowing but not stopping him Oren swings for my neck and I duck unsheathing another blade and slicing him along the ribs just like I did during our challenge My ankle isnt going to let me kick or even land a decent punch so its up to my blades He recovers quickly and pivots with the sword catching me at my stomach in a clean slice that would eviscerate me if not for Miras armor Instead the blade skims the scales sliding right off me What the hell Orens eyes fly wide Shes destroyed my shoulder Jack cries stumbling to his feet and distracting the others I cant move it He clutches the joint and I grin Thats the thing about having weak joints I say palming another blade You know exactly where to strike Kill her Jack orders still clutching his shoulder as he backs away a few steps then turns and runs in the opposite direction disappearing into the tree line in no time Fucking coward Tynan jabs with his sword and I spin away whitehot pain stealing my sight for a heartbeat before I swipe backward plunging my dagger into his side then pivoting shoving my elbow up into Orens chin as he attacks rattling his head You fucking bitch Tynan screams pressing his palm against his oozing side Such an originalI take advantage of Orens dazed expression and slice open his hipinsult The move costs me and a scream rips from my throat as Tynans sword cuts into my upper right arm along the direction of the bone The armor keeps it from penetrating my ribs but I know Ill have a hell of a bruise tomorrow as I wrench myself away blood flowing freely as I peel myself off the sword Behind you Xaden shouts I pivot to see Orens sword held high ready to separate my head from my shoulders but the golden dragon snaps its jaw and Oren stumbles to the side with terrorfilled eyes as if hes just now realized that it has teeth I sidestep and knock the handle of my blade against the base of his skull He crumples unconscious and I dont wait to see him fall before turning back toward Tynan who has his bloodied sword ready You cant interfere Tynan shouts at Xaden but I dont dare look away from my opponent long enough to see how the wingleader reacts No but I can narrate Xaden retorts Hes obviously on my side here which confuses the hell out of me since more than anything Im certain he wants me dead But maybe its not my life hes protecting but the golden dragons I chance a quick glance Yeah Sgaeyl looks pissed Her head undulates in a serpentine motiona clear sign of agitationand those narrowed golden eyes of hers are focused on Tynan who is now trying to circle me like were on the mat but I wont let him get between me and the little golden dragon Your arm is shot Sorrengail Tynan hisses his face pale and sweaty Im used to functioning in pain asshole Are you I raise the dagger in my right hand just to prove that I can despite the blood that runs down my arm and drips from the tip of my blade saturating the wrap across my palm My gaze drops meaningfully to his side I know exactly where I sliced into you If you dont get to a healer soon youll bleed out internally Rage contorts his features and he moves to strike I try to flick my knife at him but it slips from my bloodsoaked hand and lands with a thud in the grass several feet away And I know my bravado wont be enough to save me now My arm is shot My leg is shot But at least I made Jack Barlowe run away before I died As a last thought thats not a bad one Just as Tynan reaches up to twohand his sword preparing for a killing blow I catch a glimpse of movement to my right Its Xaden And rules be damned he steps forward as though he intends to stop Tynan from killing me I barely have a moment to register surprise that Xaden would ever save me for any reason when a gust of wind slams into my back and I stumble forward onto my destroyed ankle flinging my arms out to keep my balance and grimacing at the shooting pain Tynans mouth hangs open and he staggers backward his head tilting so far back its nearly perpendicular to his torso Shade envelops us both as he continues to back away Chest heaving my lungs desperate for air I chance a look over my shoulder to see why Tynans retreating And my heart lurches into my throat Standing with the golden one tucked under an enormous scarred black wing is the biggest dragon Ive ever seen in my lifethe unbonded black dragon Professor Kaori showed us in class I dont even come close to reaching its ankle A growl resonates through its chest vibrating the ground around me as it lowers its gigantic head baring dripping teeth Fear ripples through every cell in my body as its hot breath blows over me Step aside Silver One a deep gruff definitely male voice orders I blink Wait What Did he just speak to me Yes You Move Theres zero room for argument in his tone and I limp to the side nearly stumbling over Orens unconscious body as Tynan breaks into a screaming run fleeing for the trees The black dragons eyes narrow to glare at Tynan and he opens his mouth wide a second before fire shoots across the field blasting heat against the side of my face and incinerating everything in its pathincluding Tynan Flames crackle at the edges of the blackened path and I turn slowly to face the dragon wondering if Im about to be next His giant golden eyes study me but I hold my ground tilting my chin upward You should end the enemy at your feet My eyebrows jerk upward His mouth didnt move He spoke to me buthis mouth didnt move Oh shit Because hes in my head I cant kill an unconscious man I shake my head though whether its in protest at his suggestion or a result of my confusion is up for debate He would kill you if given the same chance I glance down at Oren still unconscious in the grass beside my feet Its not like I can argue that astute assessment Well thats a statement on his character Not mine The dragon only blinks in response and I cant quite tell if thats a good thing or not Theres a flash of blue out of the corner of my eye then a whoosh of air as Xaden and Sgaeyl take off leaving me here with the giant black dragon and the little golden one Guess Xadens momentary concern for my life is over The dragons giant nostrils flare Youre bleeding Stop it My arm Its not that simple when youve been run through with a I shake my head again Am I seriously arguing with a dragon This is so fucking surreal You know what Thats a great idea I manage to cut off what remains of my right shirtsleeve and wrap it around the wound holding one end of the fabric with my teeth as I tie it tight to apply pressure and slow the bleeding There Better It will do He tilts his head at me Your hands are bound too Do you bleed often I try not to He scoffs Lets go Violet Sorrengail He lifts his head and the golden dragon peeks out from under his wing How do you know my name I gawk up at him And to think Id almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are He sighs the gust of his breath rattling the trees Get on my back Oh Shit Hes choosingme Get on your back I repeat like a fucking parrot Have you seen you Do you have any idea how huge you are Id need a damned ladder to get up there The look he gives me can only be described as annoyance One does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up Now get on The golden one moves out from under the shelter of the big ones wing Its tiny compared to the monstrosity before me and apparently completely defenseless with the exception of those teeth like a playful puppy I cant just leave it I say What if Oren wakes up or Jack comes back The black dragon chuffs The golden one bends down flexing its legs and then launches into the sky its golden wings catching the sun as it flies off skimming the tops of the trees So it can fly That would have been nice to know twenty minutes ago Get On the black dragon growls shaking the ground and trees at the edge of the field You dont want me I argue Im Im not going to tell you again Point taken Fear grasps my throat like a fist and I hobble over to his leg This isnt like climbing a tree There are no handholds no easy path just a series of hardasstone scales that dont exactly give me a foothold My ankle and arm arent doing me any favors either How the hell am I going to get up there I raise my left arm and suck in a breath before placing my hand on his front leg The scales are larger and thicker than my hand and surprisingly warm to the touch They layer into the next above them in an intricate pattern that leaves no space to grab hold You are a rider are you not That seems up for debate at the moment My heart thunders Is he going to cook me alive for being too slow A low frustrated grumble sounds in his chest and then he shocks me to the core as he stretches forward his front leg becoming a ramp Dragons never supplicate for anyone and yet here he is bowing to make it easier for me to climb on Its steep but manageable I dont hesitate crawling up his front leg on my hands and knees to balance my weight and spare my ankle but the strain on my arm has me gasping by the time I climb over his shoulder and reach his back dodging the pointed spikes that ripple down most of his neck like a mane Holy shit Im on the back of a dragon Sit I see the seatthe smooth scaly divot just in front of his wingsand sit bending my knees like Professor Kaori taught us Then I grab ahold of the thick ridges of scales we call the pommel where his neck meets his shoulders Everything about him is bigger than any model we practiced on My body isnt built to stay on any dragon let alone one of his size Theres no way Ill be able to stay seated This is about to be the first and last ride of my life My name is Tairneanach son of Murtcuideam and Fiaclanfuil descended from the cunning Dubhmadinn line He stands to his full height bringing me eye level with the canopy of trees around the clearing and I squeeze a little tighter with my thighs But Im not going to assume that youll be able to remember that once we reach the field so Tairn will do until I inevitably have to remind you I inhale swiftly but theres no time to process his namehis historybefore he bends slightly and launches us into the sky It feels like I imagine a stone does after being flung from a catapult except it takes every ounce of strength I have to stay on this particular stone Holy shit The ground falls away as we soar Tairns enormous wings beating the air into submission and pitching upward My body lifts off his back and I dig in with my hands trying to keep anchored but the wind the angle its all too much and my grip falters My hands slip Fuck Scrambling for purchase my hands rake down Tairns back as I skid past his wings rapidly approaching the sharp scales of his morningstar tail No no NO He banks left and whatever hope I had of getting a handhold tumbles right off with me Im in free fall Just because you survive Threshing doesnt mean youll survive the ride to the flight field Being chosen isnt the only test and if you cant hold your seat then youll fly straight into the ground Page fifty the Book of Brennan CHAPTER FIFTEEN Terror clogs my throat and stutters my heart Air rushes past me as I plummet toward the mountainous terrain beneath and the sun catches the scales of the golden one far beneath me Im going to die Thats the only possible outcome Vises clamp around my ribs and over my shoulders stopping my descent and my body jerks with whiplash as Im yanked upward again Youre making us look bad Stop it Im clasped in Tairns claws Hes actuallycaught me instead of finding me unworthy and letting me fall to my death Its not like its easy to stay on your back when youre doing acrobatics I shout up He glances down at me and I swear the ridge above his eye arches Simple flight is hardly acrobatics There is absolutely nothing simple about you I wrap my arms around the knuckles of his claws noting that his sharp talons are draped harmlessly around the sides of my body Hes huge but hes also careful as he flies us along the mountain Hes one of the deadliest dragons in Navarre Professor Kaoris lesson What else had he said The only unbonded black dragon hadnt agreed to bond this year He hadnt even been seen in the last five years His rider died in the Tyrrish rebellion Tairn swings me upward and then releases me sending me flying high above him and I flail My stomach drops at the height of his toss and then I fall for two heartbeats before Tairn rushes up catching me on his back between his wings Now get in the seat and actually hold on this time or no one is going to believe that Ive actually chosen you he growls I still cant believe youve chosen me I have half a mind to tell him that getting back to the seat isnt as easy as hes implying but he levels out and his wings catch the air in a gentle glide cutting the wind resistance Inch by inch I crawl up his back until I reach the seat and settle in again I hold on to his ridges so hard my hands cramp Youre going to have to strengthen your legs Didnt you practice Indignation ripples up my spine Of course I practiced Theres no need to shout I can hear you just fine The entire mountain can probably hear you Was everyones dragon a curmudgeon Or just mine My eyes widen I havea dragon And not just any dragon I have Tairneanach Grip harder with your knees I can barely feel you back there Im trying I push my knees in and the muscles of my thighs tremble as he banks left softer this time than last his angle not quite as steep as he changes course in a wide arc taking us back toward Basgiath Im justnot as strong as other riders I know exactly who and what you are Violet Sorrengail My legs shake until they lock the muscles freezing in place as though bands have been wrapped around them but theres no pain I glance over my shoulder and see his morningstar tail what feels like miles behind us Hes doing this Hes holding me in place Guilt settles in my stomach I should have focused more on strength training for my legs I should have spent more time preparing myself for this He shouldnt have to spend his energy on keeping his rider seated Im sorry I just didnt think Id make it this far A loud sigh resonates through my mind I didnt think I would either so we have that in common I sit higher in the seat and look out over the landscape wind ripping tears from the corners of my eyes No wonder most riders choose to wear goggles There are at least a dozen dragons in the air each putting their rider through a trial of dips and turns Reds oranges greens browns the sky is speckled with color My heart lurches as I see a rider fall from the back of a Red Swordtail and unlike Tairn the dragon doesnt dip to catch the firstyear I look away before the body hits the ground Its not anyone you know Thats what I tell myself Rhiannon Ridoc Trina Sawyer Theyre all probably safely bonded and already waiting at the field Were going to have to put on a show Awesome The idea is anything but You will not fall I will not allow it The bands around my legs extend to my hands and I feel the pulse of invisible energy You will trust me Not a question An order Lets get it over with I cant move my legs my fingers my hands so theres nothing I can do but sit back and hope I enjoy whatever hell hes about to put me through His wings give a mighty beat and we lurch upward in what feels like a ninetydegree climb leaving my stomach back at the lower altitude He crests the top of the snowdusted peaks and we hang there for a breath of a second before he twists diving back down at the same terrifying angle Its the most horrifying and yet exhilarating moment of my life Until he twists again sending us into a spiral My body is wrenched this way and that as he completes turn after turn pulling us out of the dive only to bank so hard I swear the land becomes the sky then repeats it all until my face splits into a grin There is nothing like this I think we made our point He pulls us level then banks right starting up the valley that leads to the box canyon of the training fields The sun is close to setting behind the peaks but theres plenty of light to see the golden dragon up ahead hovering as though its waiting Maybe it didnt choose a rider but it will live to decide again next year and thats all that matters Or maybe it will see that we humans arent so great after all Why did you choose me I have to know because as soon as we land there are going to be questions Because you saved her Tairns head inclines toward the golden as we approach and she follows after us Our speed slows But I shake my head Dragons value strength and cunning andferocity in their riders None of which defines me Please do tell me more about what I should value Sarcasm drips from his tone as we pass over the Gauntlet and crest the narrow entrance to the training fields I suck in a sharp breath at the sight of so many dragons There are hundreds gathered along the rocky edges of the mountain slopes behind the bleachers that were erected overnight Spectators And at the bottom of the valley in the same field Id walked only a couple of days before are two lines of dragons facing each other They are divided between those still in the quadrant who chose in years past and those who chose today Tairn tells me We are the seventyfirst bond to enter the fields Mom will be here on the dais in front of the bleachers and maybe Ill get more than a cursory glance but her attention will mostly be on the seventy or so newly bonded pairs A ferocious roar of celebration goes up among the dragons as we fly in every head swinging our way and I know its in deference to Tairn So is the parting of the dragons at the very center of the field making room for Tairn to land He releases the bands holding me in my seat then hovers over the grass for a few wing beats and I see the golden dragon flying furiously to catch up How ironic Tairn is the most celebrated dragon in the Vale and Im the most unlikely rider in the quadrant You are the smartest of your year The most cunning I gulp at the compliment brushing it off I was trained as a scribe not a rider You defended the smallest with ferocity And strength of courage is more important than physical strength Since you apparently need to know before we land My throat tightens from his words emotion forming a knot I have to swallow past Oh Shit I hadnt spoken those words Id thought them He can read my thoughts See Smartest of your year So much for privacy Youll never be alone again That sounds more like a threat than a comfort I think Of course I knew that dragons maintain a mental bond with their riders but the extent of it is more than a little daunting Tairn scoffs in reply The golden dragon reaches us her wings beating twice as fast as Tairns and we land in the dead center of the field The impact jars me slightly but I sit up tall in the seat and even let go of the pommel ridges See I can hang on just fine when youre not moving Tairn tucks his wings up and looks over his shoulder at me with an expression thats the closest thing to a dragon rolling his eyes that Ive ever seen You need to dismount before I rethink my selection then tell the rollkeeper I know what to do I pull in a shaky breath I just didnt think Id be alive to do it Surveying both options for dismount I move right to shelter my ankle as long as possible There are no healers allowed in the flight field only riders but hopefully someone thought to pack a medical kit because Im going to need stitches and a splint I scoot over the scales of Tairns shoulder and before I can lament the distance Im about to have to jump on the wreckage of my ankle Tairn shifts slightly angling his front leg Theres a sound from the slopes that reminds me of mutteringif dragons mutter They do and they are Ignore it Again theres no room for argument in his tone Thanks I whisper then slide down on my butt like hes a bumpy piece of lethal playground equipment taking the brunt of the impact with my left leg when I hit the ground Thats one way to do it I cant stop the smile on my face or the joy that stings my eyes at the sight of other firstyears standing in front of their dragons Im alive and Im no longer a cadet Im a rider The first step hurts like hell but I pivot toward the golden one who is tucked in tight next to Tairn surveying me with bright eyes as she flicks her feathertail Im glad you made it Glad isnt even the right word Thrilled relieved grateful But maybe you should fly off the next time someone suggests you save yourself eh She blinks Maybe I was saving you Her voice is higher sweeter in my mind My lips part and the muscles in my face go slack with shock Didnt anyone tell you that youre not supposed to speak to humans who arent your rider Dont go getting yourself in trouble Goldie I whisper From what I hear dragons are pretty strict about breaking that rule She simply sits tucking her wings in and tilts her head at me in that shouldbeimpossible angle that almost makes me laugh Holy hell the rider of the red dragon to my right exclaims and I turn toward him Hes a firstyear from Claw Section Fourth Wing but I dont remember his name Is that He openly stares with fearwide eyes at Tairn Yeah I say smiling wider He is My ankle throbs aches and generally feels like its going to come apart at any second as I limp across the wide field heading for the small formation directly ahead of me Behind me wind sporadically gusts as more dragons land and their riders dismount to have their names recorded but its softer and softer as the line spreads farther down the field Dusk falls and a series of mage lights illuminates the crowd in the bleachers and on the dais In the very center right above where the redhead from Parapet is recording roll sits my mother dressed in all her military finery medals and all lest anyone forget exactly who she is Though there is an assortment of generals on the dais each representing their wing theres only one more highly decorated than Lilith Sorrengail And Melgren the commanding general of all Navarrian forces has his beady eyes on Tairn in open assessment His focus flicks toward me and I suppress a shudder Theres nothing but cold calculation in those eyes Mom rises as I approach the rollkeeper at the base of the dais whos recording bonded pairs before motioning the next rider forward to maintain secrecy of a dragons full name Professor Kaori jumps off the sixfoot platform to my left and stares openmouthed at Tairn his gaze sweeping over the massive black dragon memorizing every single detail Is that really Commandant Panchek starts hovering at the edge of the dais with more than a dozen other uniformed highranking officers all gaping Dont say it Mom hisses her eyes on Tairn not me Not until she does Because only a rider and the rollkeeper know a dragons full name and shes not certain Im really his Thats exactly what shes implying Like Id be able to hijack Tairn Anger simmers in my veins overtaking the pain coursing through my body as I move forward in the line so theres only one other rider ahead of me Mom forced me into the Riders Quadrant She didnt care if I lived or died as I crossed the parapet The only thing she cares about now is how my flaws might mar her sterling reputation or how my bonding might further her own agenda And now shes staring at my dragon without even bothering to look down and see if Im all right Fuck Her Its everything I expected and yet still so disappointing The rider ahead finishes moving out of the way and the rollkeeper looks up glancing wideeyed at Tairn before lowering her shocked gaze to mine and beckoning me forward Violet Sorrengail she says as she writes in the Book of Riders Nice to see that you made it She offers me a quick shaky smile For the record please tell me the name of the dragon who chose you I lift my chin Tairneanach Pronunciation could use some work Tairns voice rumbles through my head Hey at least I remembered I think back in his general direction wondering if hell hear me across the field At least I didnt let you fall to your death He sounds utterly bored but he definitely heard me The woman grins shaking her head as she writes down his name I cant believe he bonded Violet hes a legend I open my mouth to agree Andarnaurram The sweet high voice of the golden fills my mind Andarna for short I feel the blood rush from my face and the edges of my vision sway as I pivot on my good ankle staring back across the field at where the golden dragonAndarnanow stands between Tairns front legs Excuse me Violet are you all right the redhead asks and everyone around me above me leans in Tell her the golden insists Tairn What am I supposed to I think at him Tell the rollkeeper her name Tairn echoes Violet the rollkeeper repeats Do you need a mender I turn back to the woman and clear my throat And Andarnaurram I whisper Her eyes fly wide Both dragons she squawks I nod And all hell breaks loose Though this officer considers himself to be an expert on all matters dragonkind there is a great deal we dont know about the way dragons govern themselves There is a clear hierarchy among the most powerful and deference is paid to elders but I have not been able to discern how it is they make laws for themselves or at what point a dragon decided to bond only one rider rather than go for better odds with two Colonel Kaoris Field Guide to Dragonkind CHAPTER SIXTEEN Absolutely not one general shouts loud enough that I can hear her all the way from the little medical station thats been set up at the end of the bleachers for riders Its nothing but a row of a dozen tables and some flownin supplies to tide us over until we can get to the Healer Quadrant but at least the pain medication is taking effect Two dragons I havetwo dragons The generals have been screaming at each other for the last half hour long enough for a chill to settle in the night air and for an instructor Ive never met to sew up both sides of my arm Lucky for me Tynan mostly sliced through muscle but didnt sever it Unlucky for me Jack is getting his shoulder examined about a dozen feet away He strutted over from the back of an Orange Scorpiontail to record his bond with the rollkeeper whod kept doing her job regardless of the generals arguing on the dais behind her Jack hasnt quit staring at Tairn across the field How is that Professor Kaori asks quietly tightening the straps around my splinted ankle There are about a million other questions in his slashing dark eyes but he keeps them to himself Hurts like hell The swelling made it nearly impossible to get my boot back on without loosening every single lace to its widest position but at least I didnt have to crawl across the field like a girl from Second Wing who had broken her leg during dismount Shes seven tables back crying softly as the rider field medics try to set her leg Youll be focused on strengthening your bonds and riding in the next couple of months so as long as you dont have trouble mounting or dismountinghis head tilts as he ties off the straps of my splintwhich after what I saw I dont think you willthis sprain should heal before your next round of challenges Two lines deepen between his brow Or I can call Nolon No I shake my head Ill heal If youre sure He obviously isnt Every eye in this valley is on me and my dragondragons I correct myself I cant afford to appear weak He frowns but nods Do you know who made it out of my squad I ask fear knotting my throat Please let Rhiannon be alive And Trina And Ridoc And Sawyer All of them I havent seen Trina or Tynan Professor Kaori answers slowly like hes trying to soften a blow It doesnt Tynan wont be coming I whisper guilt gnawing at my stomach That is not your kill to take credit for Tairn mentally growls I see Professor Kaori murmurs What the hell do you mean you think it needs surgery Jack bellows from my left I mean it looks like the weapon severed a couple of ligaments but well have to get you to the healers to be sure the other instructor says his voice infinitely patient as he secures Jacks sling I look Jack straight in those evil eyes and smile Im done being scared of him He ran back in that meadow Rage mottles his cheeks in the mage light and he swings his feet over the end of his table and charges toward me You I what I slip off the end of my table and leave my hands loose by the sheaths at my thighs Professor Kaoris eyebrows jump as he glances between us You he murmurs Me I answer keeping my focus on Jack But Professor Kaori moves between us throwing his palm out at Jack I wouldnt get any closer to her Hiding behind our instructors now Sorrengail Jacks uninjured fist curls I didnt hide out there and Im not hiding here I raise my chin Im not the one who ran She doesnt need to hide behind me when shes bonded to the most powerful dragon of your year Professor Kaori warns Jack whose eyes narrow on me Your orange is a good choice Barlowe Baide right Hes had four other riders before you Jack nods Professor Kaori looks back over his shoulder at the line of dragons As aggressive as Baide might be from the way Tairns looking at you hell have no problem scorching your bones into the earth if you take another step toward his rider Jack stares at me in disbelief You Me The throbbing in my ankle is down to a manageable dull ache even standing on it He shakes his head and the look in his eyes transforms from shock to envy to fear as he pivots toward the professor I dont know what she told you about what happened out there Nothing The instructor folds his arms across his chest Is there something I need to know Jack pales going white as a sheet in the mage light as another injured firstyear hobbles over blood streaming from his thigh and torso Everyone who needs to know already knows I lock eyes with Jack Guess were done for the night Kaori says as a line of dragons flies in only visible by their silhouettes in the darkness The senior riders are back You two should return to your dragons Jack huffs and marches off across the field I glance at the generals still gathered in heated discussion on the dais Professor Kaori has anyone ever bonded two dragons If anyone knows its the professor of Dragonkind He turns with me to face the arguing leadership You would be the first Not sure why theyre fighting about it though The decision wont be up to them It wont Wind gusts as dozens of dragons land on the opposite side of the firstyears rows of mage lights hanging between them Nothing about who dragons choose is up to humans Kaori assures me We only like to maintain the illusion that were in control Something tells me theyve just been waiting for the others to make it back before they meet The leadership My brow furrows Kaori shakes his head The dragons The dragons are going to meet Thank you for tending to my ankle Id better get back over there I offer him a tentative smile and head across the dimly lit field to Tairn and Andarna feeling the weight of every stare in the valley as I stop and stand between the two dragons You two are causing a ruckus you know I look at Andarna then glance up at Tairn before turning around to face the field like the other firstyears Theyre not going to let us do this Oh shit what if they make me choose My stomach plummets Its up to the Empyrean to decide Tairn says but theres an edge of tension in his tone Dont leave the field This might take a while What might My question dies on my tongue as the biggest dragon Ive ever seen even larger than Tairn stalks toward us from the opening to the valley Each dragon it passes walks into the center of the field and follows after gathering dozens as it walks Is that Codagh Tairn answers General Melgrens dragon I make out the patchy holes in his battlescarred wings as he comes closer his golden gaze focused on Tairn in a way that makes me nauseous He growls low in his throat turning those sinister eyes on me Tairn rumbles his own growl stepping forward so Im between his massive claws Theres zero doubt Im the subject of both disgruntled snarls Yep Were talking about you Andarna says as the line passes by and she joins Stay close to the wingleader until we return Tairn orders Surely he meant to say squad leader You heard what I said Or not I glance around and spot Xaden standing across the field his arms crossed and legs spread as he stares at Tairn The riders are eerily silent as the dragons empty the meadow taking flight in a steady stream near the end and landing halfway up the southernmost peak in a shadowy grouping I can barely define in the moonlight The second the last of the dragons flies off chaos erupts Firstyears swarm the center of the field where I happen to be standing shouting in exuberance and searching for their friends My eyes scan the crowd hoping for some glimpse of Rhi I shout spotting Rhiannon in the mob and limping her way Violet She crushes me into a hug pulling away when I wince at the fresh pain in my arm What happened Tynans sword I barely get the answer out of my mouth before Im snatched off my feet by Ridoc who spins me around my feet flying out in front of me Look who rode in on the baddest motherfucker around Put her down Rhiannon chides Shes bleeding Oh shit sorry Ridoc says and my feet find the ground Its fine Theres fresh blood on the bandage but I dont think Ive torn my stitches And painkillers are awesome Are you all right Who did you guys bond The Green Daggertail Rhiannon grins Feirge And it was justeasy She sighs I saw her and just knew Aotrom Ridoc says with pride Brown Swordtail Sliseag Sawyer throws his arms around Rhiannons and Ridocs shoulders Red Swordtail We all cheer and Im swept into his hug next Out of all of us Im happiest for him for all hes had to endure to get here Trina I ask as he lets me go One by one they shake their heads looking to the others for answers An impossible heaviness settles in my heart and I search for any other reason I meantheres a possibility shes just unbonded right Sawyer shakes his head sorrow slackening his shoulders I saw her fall from the back of an Orange Clubtail My heart sinks Tynan Ridoc asks his gaze jumping between us Tairn killed him I say softly In his defense Tynan had already run me through once I gesture to the wound on my arm And he was trying to He tried what Im spun around by the shoulders and yanked against a chest Dain My arms wind around his back and hold fast as I breathe deeply Damn it Violet Justdamn He squeezes me tight then pushes me to arms length Youre hurt Im fine I assure him but that doesnt quell the worry in his eyes Im not sure anything ever will But were all thats left of our squads firstyears Dains gaze rises to look at the others and he nods Four out of nine Thatshis jaw ticks onceto be expected The dragons are currently holding a meeting of the Empyreantheir leadership Stay here until they return he says to the others before looking down at me You come with me Its probably my mother beckoning me through him Surely shell want to see me with everything thats going on I glance across the field but its not Mom I find watching me but Xaden his expression unreadable When Dain takes my hand and tugs I turn away from Xaden following Dain to the opposite edge of the field where were hidden in shadow Guess its not about Mom What the actual fuck happened out there Because Ive got Cath telling me that not only did Tairn choose you but so did the small oneAdarn His fingers lace with mine panic swirling in his brown eyes Andarna I correct him a smile playing on my lips at the thought of the small golden dragon Theyre going to make you choose His expression hardens and the certainty there makes me recoil Im not choosing I shake my head disengaging our hands No human has ever chosen and Im not about to be the first And who the hell is Dain to tell me that You are He rips his hand over his hair and his composure slips You have to trust me You do trust me right Of course I do Then you have to choose Andarna He nods as if his decree equals a decision made The gold one is the safest choice of the two Why because Tairn isTairn Does Dain think Im too weak for a dragon as strong as Tairn My mouth opens then shuts like a fish out of water as I search for any reply that isnt fuck off Theres no way in hell Im rejecting Tairn But my heart wont let me reject Andarna either Are they going to make me choose I think in their direction Theres no response and where Ive felt anextension in my mind of who I am stretching my mental boundaries since Tairn first spoke to me in that field theres nothing now Im cut off Dont panic Im not choosing I repeat softer this time What if I cant have either of them What if theyve broken some sacred rule and now well all be punished You are And it has to be Andarna He grips my shoulders and leans in an edge of urgency in his tone I know shes too small to bear a rider That hasnt been tested I say defensively even though I know its true The physics just dont match up And it doesnt matter It will mean that you wont be able to ride with a wing but theyll probably make you a permanent instructor here like Kaori Thats because his signet power makes him indispensable as a teacher not because his dragon cant fly I argue And even he had the requisite four years with a combat wing before he was put behind a desk Dain looks away and I can almost see the gears in his mind turning as he calculateswhat My risk My choice My freedom Even if you take Andarna into combat theres only a chance youll be killed You take Tairn and Xaden will get you killed You think Melgren is terrifying Ive been here for a year longer than you have Vi At least you know what youre getting when it comes to Melgren Xaden isnt only twice as ruthless but hes dangerously unpredictable I blink Wait What are you saying Theyre a mated pair Tairn and Sgaeyl The strongest bonded pair in centuries My mind whirs Mated pairs cant be separated for long or their health diminishes so theyre always stationed together Always Which meansoh gods Justtell me how it happened He must see me fumbling because his voice softens So I do I tell him about Jack and his band of murderous friends hunting Andarna I tell him about falling and the field and Xaden watching Xadenshockingly protecting me with his warning when Oren was at my back He had the perfect opportunity to end me without it tipping his scales and he chose to help What the hell am I supposed to do with that Xaden was there Dain says quietly but the gentleness leaches from his voice Yes I nod But he left after Tairn showed up Xaden was there when you defended Andarna and then Tairn justshowed up he asks slowly Yes Thats what I just said Was the timeline confusing him What are you getting at Dont you see what happened What Xadens done His grip tightens Thank gods for the dragonscale armor or I might have bruises tomorrow Please do tell me what it is you think Ive done A shape emerges from the shadows and my pulse quickens as Xaden steps into the moonlight darkness falling off him like a discarded veil Heat rushes through every vein wakes every nerve ending I hate the reaction of my body to the sight of him but I cant deny it His appeal is so fucking inconvenient You manipulated Threshing Dains hands drop from my shoulders and he turns to face our wingleader the set of his shoulders rigid as he puts himself between us Oh shit thats a huge allegation to hurl Dain thats Paranoid I sidestep Dains back If Xaden was going to kill me he wouldnt have waited this long to do it Hes had every possible opportunity and yet Im still standing here Bonded To his dragons mate Xadens not going to kill me The realization makes my chest tighten makes me reexamine everything that happened in that field makes my sense of gravity shift beneath my feet Is that an official accusation Xaden looks at Dain like a hindrance an annoyance Did you step in Dain demands Did I what Xaden arches a dark brow and levels a look on Dain that would make a lesser person wither Did I see her outnumbered and already wounded Did I think her bravery was as admirable as it was fucking reckless He turns that stare on me and I feel the impact all the way to my toes And I would do it again I raise my chin Wellthefuckaware Xaden roars losing his temper for the first time since I met him on Parapet I pull in a quick breath and Xaden does the same as if hes just as shocked by his outburst as I am Did I see her fight off three bigger cadets His glare pivots to Dain Because the answer to all of those is yes But youre asking the wrong question Aetos What you should be asking is if Sgaeyl saw it too Dain swallows and looks away obviously rethinking his position His mate told him I whisper Sgaeyl called for Tairn Shes never been a fan of bullies Xaden says to me But dont mistake it as an act of kindness toward you Shes fond of the little dragon Unfortunately Tairn chose you all on his own Fuck Dain mutters My thought exactly Xaden shakes his head at Dain Sorrengail is the last person on the Continent Id ever want to be chained to me I didnt do this Ouch It takes all the willpower in my body not to reach for my chest and make sure he didnt just rip my heart out from behind my ribs which makes absolutely zero sense since I feel the same way about him Hes the son of the Great Betrayer His father was directly responsible for Brennans death And even if I had Xaden moves toward Dain towering over him Would you really level that accusation knowing it would have been what saved the woman you call your best friend My gaze flies to Dain and a silent damning moment passes Its a simple question and yet I find myself holding my breath for his answer What do I really mean to him There arerules Dain tilts his chin to look Xaden in the eyes And out of curiosity would you have lets say bent those rules to save your precious little Violet in that field His voice ices over as he studies Dains expression with rapt fascination Xaden had taken a step Right before Tairn landed hed movedtoward me Dains jaw flexes and I see the war in his eyes Thats unfair to ask him I move to Dains side as the sound of whipping wings interrupts the night The dragons are flying back Theyve made their decision Im ordering you to answer squad leader Xaden doesnt even spare me a glance Dain swallows his eyes slamming shut No I wouldnt have My heart hits the ground Ive always known deep down that Dain valued rule and order more than relationships more than me but to have it so cruelly displayed cuts deeper than Tynans sword Xaden scoffs Dain immediately jerks his head toward mine It would have killed me to watch something happen to you Vi but the rules Its all right I force out touching his shoulder but it isnt The dragons are returning Xaden says as the first of them lands on the illuminated field Get back to formation squad leader Dain rips his gaze from mine and walks away blending into the crowd of hurried riders and their dragons Why would you do that to him I hurl at Xaden then shake my head I dont care why Forget it I mutter then march off heading back toward the spot where Tairn told me to wait Because you put too much faith in him Xaden answers anyway catching up to me without even lengthening his stride And knowing who to trust is the only thing that will keep you alivekeep us alivenot only in the quadrant but after graduation There is no us I say dodging a rider as she races past Dragons land left and right the ground trembling with the force of the riots movement Ive never seen so many dragons at flight in the same moment Oh I think youll find thats no longer the case Xaden murmurs next to me gripping my elbow and yanking me out of the path of another rider running from the other direction Yesterday he would have let me run headfirst into him Hell he might have even pushed me Tairns bonds are so powerful both to mate and rider because hes so powerful Losing his last rider nearly killed him which in turn nearly killed Sgaeyl Mated pairs lives are Interdependent I know that We move forward until were dead center in the line of riders If I wasnt so aggravated by Xadens callous attitude toward Dain I would take the time to admire just how spectacular it is to see hundreds of dragons land all around us Or maybe Id question how the man next to me manages to consume all the air in the massive field Each time a dragon chooses a rider that bond is stronger than the last which means that if you die Violence it sets off a chain of events that potentially ends with me dying too His expression is immovable marble but the anger in his eyes leaves me breathless Its purerage So yeah unfortunately for everyone involved theres now an us if the Empyrean lets Tairns choice stand Oh Gods Im tethered to Xaden Riorson And now that Tairn is in play that other cadets know hes willing to bond He sighs annoyance rippling over his features his strong jaw working as he looks away Thats why Tairn told me to stay with you I whisper as the consequences of todays actions settle in my churning stomach Because of the unbonded There are at least three dozen of them standing on the opposite side of the field watching us with avarice in their eyesincluding Oren Seifert The unbonded are going to try to kill you in hopes theyll get Tairn to bond them Xaden shakes his head at Garrick as he approaches and the section leader glances between us his mouth set in a firm line before retreating across the field Tairn is one of the strongest dragons on the Continent and the vast power he channels is about to be yours The next few months the unbonded will try to kill a newly paired rider while the bond is weak while they still have a chance of that dragon changing its mind and picking them so theyre not set back a full year And for Tairn Theyll do just about anything He sighs again like its his new fulltime job There are fortyone unbonded riders for which you are now target number one He holds up a single finger And Tairn thinks youll play bodyguard I snort Little does he know just how much you dislike me He knows exactly how much I value my own life Xaden retorts glancing down my body Youre freakishly calm for someone who just heard shes about to be hunted Its a typical Wednesday for me I shrug ignoring the way his gaze heats my skin And honestly being hunted by fortyone people is a lot less intimidating than constantly watching dark corners for you A breeze hits my back as Andarna lands behind me followed by a gust of wind and shuddering ground when its Tairn Without another word Xaden rips his gaze from mine and walks away cutting a slightly diagonal path across the field to where Sgaeyl overshadows the other wingleaders dragons Tell me its going to be all right I murmur toward Andarna and Tairn It is how it should be Tairn answers his voice gruff and bored at the same time You didnt answer before Fine it sounds a little accusatory Humans cant know whats said within the Empyrean Andarna answers Its a rule So every rider was blocked not just me The thought is oddly comforting Also the whole Empyrean is a new term for me today Kaori must be in heaven tonight with all the dragon politics coming to light What did they decide I glance at my mother but shes looking everywhere but my direction General Melgren moves toward the front of the dais his uniform dripping in medals Dains right in one waythe top general in our kingdom is terrifying Hes never had an issue using infantry for fodder and his cruelty when it comes to overseeing the interrogationand executionof prisoners is wellknown at least at my familys dining room table His enormous nightmare of a dragon takes up the entire space beside the dais and a hush falls over the crowd as Melgren angles his hands in front of his face Codagh has relayed that the dragons have spoken regarding the Sorrengail girl Lesser magic allows his voice to magically amplify over the field for all to hear Woman I mentally correct him my stomach knotting While tradition has shown us that there is one rider for every dragon there has never been a case of two dragons selecting the same rider and therefore there is no dragon law against it he declares While we riders may not feel as though this isequitablehis tone implies that hes one of themdragons make their own laws Both Tairn and He looks over his shoulder and his aide rushes forward to whisper in his ear Andarna have chosen Violet Sorrengail and so their choice stands The crowd murmurs but my shoulders sag in acute relief I dont have to make an impossible choice As it should be Tairn grumbles Humans have no say in the laws of dragons Mom steps forward and makes the same gesture with her hands to project her voice but I cant concentrate on what shes saying as she closes out the formal portion of the Threshing ceremony promising the unbonded riders another chance next year If they dont manage to kill one of us while our bonds are weak in the next few months and try to bond our dragons themselves I belong to Tairn and Andarnaand in some really fuckedup wayXaden My scalp prickles and I glance across the field at him As if sensing my gaze he looks over and holds up a single finger Target number one Welcome to a family that knows no boundaries no limits and no end my mother finishes and a cheer resounds around the field Riders step forward I look left and right in confusion but so does every other rider Five steps or so Tairn says I take them Dragons it is our honor as always Mom calls out Now we celebrate Heat blasts my back and I hiss in pain as riders on both sides of me cry out My back feels like its on fucking fire and yet everyone across the field is cheering raucously some of them racing our way Other riders are caught up in embraces Youll like it Tairn promises Its unique The pain fades to a dull ache and I glance over my shoulder Theres a solid blacksomething peeking out from the vest Ill like what Violet Dain reaches me his smile wide as he cups my face You kept both of them I guess I did My lips curve Its allsurreal all too much for one day Wheres your He lets go and circles me Can I unlace this Just the top he asks tugging at the raised neck of the back of my vest I nod A few pushes and pulls later the crisp October air nips at the base of my neck Holy shit You have to see this Tell the boy to move Tairn orders Tairn says you should move Dain steps out of the way Suddenly my vision isnt mine Im looking at my own back throughAndarnas eyes A back that has a glistening black relic of a dragon midflight stretching from shoulder to shoulder and in the center the silhouette of a shimmering golden one Its beautiful I whisper Im marked by their magic as a rider now as their rider We know Andarna answers I blink and my vision is mine again and Dains hands lace up my corset quickly then are on my face tipping it up toward his You have to know that I would do anything to save you Violet to keep you safe he blurts panic in his eyes What Riorson said He shakes his head I know I say reassuringly nodding even as something cracks in my heart You always want me safe Hed do anything Except break the rules You have to know how I feel about you His thumb strokes over my cheek his eyes searching for something and then his mouth is on mine His lips are soft but the kiss is firm and delight races up my spine After years Dain is finally kissing me The thrill is gone in less than a heartbeat Theres no heat No energy No sharp slice of lust Disappointment sours the moment but not for Dain Hes all smiles as he pulls away It was over in an instant It was everything Ive ever wantedexcept Shit I dont want it anymore It is therefore only natural that the more powerful the dragon the more powerful the signet its rider manifests One should beware of a strong rider who bonds a smaller dragon but even warier of the unbonded cadet who will stop at nothing to seize a chance to bond Major Afendras Guide to the Riders Quadrant Unauthorized Edition CHAPTER SEVENTEEN After sleeping in the crowded barracks for the last two months its weird and oddly decadent to have my own room Ill never take the luxury of privacy for granted again I close my door behind me as I limp into the hallway Rhiannons door across the small hall from mine opens and I see Sawyers tall lean frame come out He runs his fingers through his hair and when he sees me his eyebrows rise and he freezeshis cheeks almost as red as his freckles Good morning I grin Violet He forces an awkward smile and walks off headed toward the main hallway of the firstyear dormitory A couple from Second Wing holds hands as they come out of the room next to Rhiannons and I offer them a smile as I lean back against my door and wait testing my ankle by rolling it Its sore just like every time I sprain it but the brace and my boot hold it in place well enough to keep my weight on it If I were anywhere else I would call for crutches but that would just put another target on my back and according to Xaden I already have a big enough one as it is Rhiannon walks out of her room and smiles as soon as she sees me No more breakfast duty I was told last night that all the less desirable duties were being handed off to the unbonded so our energy can be redirected for flight lessons Which means Ill have to find another way to weaken my opponents before challenges Xadens right I cant always count on taking every enemy down with poison but Im not going to ignore the only advantage I have here either One more reason for the unbonded to hate us Rhiannon mutters So Sawyer huh Rhi We start down our hallway passing a few other rooms before meeting up with the main corridor that leads to the rotunda Have to say the firstyear rooms arent as spacious as the secondyears but at least we both got ones with windows A grin curves her lips I felt like celebrating She darts a quick sideeye at me And why have I not heard of you celebrating We melt into the crowd moving toward the gathering hall Havent found anyone I want to celebrate with Really Because I heard that you and a certain squad leader had a moment last night My gaze whips toward hers and I nearly stumble over my feet Come on Vi The entire quadrant was out there and you dont think someone saw you She rolls her eyes Youre not going to get a lecture from me Who gives a shit if its frowned upon to be in a relationship with a superior officer Theres no regulation and its not like any of us is guaranteed to live through the day Solid points I admit But its I shake my head searching for the right words Its not like that with us Id always hoped it would be but when he kissed methere was nothing there Like Nothing Its impossible to keep the disappointment out of my voice Well thats shitty to hear She hooks her arm through mine Im sorry Me too I sigh A door opens farther down the hall and Liam Mairi walks out with his arm wrapped around the waist of another firstyear who bonded a Brown Clubtail Looks like everyone was celebrating last night except me Good morning ladies Ridoc forces his way through the crowd and slings an arm around each of our shoulders as we enter the rotunda Or should I say riders I like the sound of riders Rhiannon replies shooting a smile in his direction It has a certain ring to it Ridoc agrees Its definitely better than dead Wheres your relic I ask Ridoc as we pass through the columns of carved dragons and take the steps into commons Right here His arm falls off my shoulders and he shoves the sleeve of his tunic up to reveal the brown mark of a dragon silhouette on his upper arm You Cant see it Its on my back That will keep you safer if youre ever separated from that massive dragon of yours His eyes dance I swear I thought I was going to shit myself when I saw him on the field What about yours Rhi Somewhere youll never see she responds You wound me He slaps his hand over his heart I highly doubt that she retorts but theres a smile on her face We move through commons and into the gathering hall then make our way through the line for breakfast Its odd to be on this side of it and I startle at the sight of the guy behind the counter Its Oren He glares at me with a hatred that trickles like ice down my spine I skip his station opting for fresh fruit that I know cant be tampered with just in case he decides to take my approach to conflict and poison me Asshole Ridoc mutters behind me I still cant believe they tried to kill you I can I shrug taking my chances with a mug of apple juice Im the weakest link right Unfortunately for me that means people are bound to try and take me out for the good of the wing We head toward the Fourth Wing section and find a table with three extra seats Mind if we Ridoc starts Absolutely Its yours A couple of guys from Tail Section scurry off the bench Sorry Sorrengail the other says over his shoulder as they find another table leaving this one empty What the hell Well that was really fucking weird Rhiannon rounds the other side of the table and I follow putting our backs to the wall as we step over the bench and sit setting our trays in front of us Im half tempted to give my underarms a whiff to see if I smell Even weirder Ridoc remarks gesturing across the hall toward First Wing Following his line of sight my eyebrows lift Jack Barlowe is being squeezed out of his table Hes forced to stand as others take his seat What the hell is going on Rhiannon bites into a pear and chews Jack moves to another tablewhose occupants wont make room for himand then finds a place two tables down How the mighty have fallen Ridoc notes watching the same show I am but theres no satisfaction in watching Jack struggle Feral dogs bite harder when theyre cornered Hey Sorrengail the stocky girl from First Wing I beat in my second challenge says with a tight smile as she walks past our table Hi I wave awkwardly as she walks away then turn to whisper to Ridoc and Rhiannon She hasnt spoken to me since I took one of her daggers in that challenge Its because you bonded Tairn Imogen blows her pink hair out of her face and throws her leg over the bench across from us to sit pushing up the sleeves of her tunic and revealing her rebellion relic The morning after Threshing is always a clusterfuck Power balance shifts and you little Sorrengail are now about to be the most powerful rider in the quadrant Anyone with common sense is going to be scared of you I blink my pulse elevating Is that whats going on I look around the hall and take note Social groups have split up and some of the cadets I would have considered threats are no longer sitting where they usually do Which is why youre now sitting with us Rhiannon arches a brow at the secondyear Because I can count on one hand the number of nice words youve said to any of us She holds up a fist with zero fingers raised Quinnthe tall secondyear in our squad who hasnt bothered to so much as look our way since Parapettakes a seat next to Imogen and Sawyer arrives sitting on Rhiannons other side Quinn tucks her blond curls behind her ears and brushes her bangs out of her eyes her round cheeks rising as she smiles at something Imogen says Have to admit the hooped piercings that line the shells of both her ears are pretty awesome and among her half dozen patches its the darkgreen onethe same color as her eyeswith two silhouettes thats most intriguing I should have studied up on what all the patches mean but according to what Ive heard they change every year Im personally a fan of the first ones weve been given I had to sew the flameshaped patch with the emblem for Fourth Wing and the centered reddish number two with great care being sure to only stitch the fabric of my corseted armor since its not like any needle is going to penetrate the scales My favorite patch though is the one beside the Flame Section one Were the squad to have the most surviving members since Parapet this years Iron Squad You werent interesting enough to sit with before Imogen responds then bites into a muffin I usually sit with my girlfriend in Claw Section Besides no use getting to know you when most of you die Quinn adds tucking her curls away again just to have them spring forward No offense None taken I start on my apple I nearly spit it out when Heaton and Emery the only thirdyears in our squad flank Imogen and Quinn on the bench across from us The only people were missing are Dain and Cianna who are eating with leadership as usual I thought Seifert would bond Heaton says to Emery across the table as though weve caught them middiscussion The normally red flames in their hair are green today Other than losing to Sorrengail he nailed every challenge He tried to kill Andarna Shit Maybe I should have kept that to myself Every head at the table turns toward me My guess would be that Tairn told the others I shrug But Barlowe bonded Ridoc questions Though from what Ive heard his Orange Scorpiontail is on the smaller side She is Quinn confirms Which is why hes struggling this morning Dont worryIm sure hell make up for his lack of social standing in other ways Rhiannon mutters her gaze narrowing on my tray You have to have some protein Vi You cant just survive on fruit Its the only food I can be sure isnt tampered with especially with Oren behind the counter I busy myself with peeling an orange Oh for fucks sake Imogen scrapes three pieces of sausage onto my plate Shes right Youre going to need all your strength to ride especially with a dragon as big as Tairn I stare at the sausage Imogen hates me just as much as Oren does Hell shes the one who broke my arm and ripped out my shoulder on assessment day You can trust her Tairn says and I startle dropping the orange She hates me Stop arguing with me and eat something Theres zero room for debate in his tone My gaze rises to meet Imogens and she tilts her head staring back in challenge I use my fork to cut the link then pop it into my mouth and chew focusing on the conversation at the table again Whats your signet Rhiannon asks Emery Air rushes down the table rattling the glasses Air manipulation Got it Thats epic Ridocs eyes widen How much air can you move None of your business He barely spares him a glance Sorrengail after class is out today youre mine Imogen says I swallow my current bite Im sorry Her pale green eyes lock on mine Meet me in the sparring gym Im already working with her on sparring Rhiannon starts Good We cant afford her to lose any challenges Imogen retorts But Im going to help you with weights We need to strengthen the muscles around your joints before challenges resume Thats the only way youll survive The hairs rise on the back of my neck And since when do you care about my survival This isnt a squad thing It cant be Not when she didnt give a shit before Since now she says gripping her fork in her fist but its the lightningfast glance toward the dais at the end of the hall that gives her away Her concern isnt coming from the goodness of her heart Something tells me its an order Squads are about to be condensed at morning formation Well be down to two in every section she continues Aetos kept the highest number of his firstyears alivehence the patchso hell be allowed to retain his squad but well probably gain a few when they strip the squads from those who werent as successful As discreetly as I can I look to my right past the other Fourth Wing tables and to the dais where Xaden sits with his executive officer and the section leaders including Garrick whose shoulders look like they should take up at least two seats Its Garrick who looks my way first his forehead lining with What is that Worry Then he looks away The only reason hed be remotely worriedhe knows He knows my fate is tethered to Xadens My gaze snaps to Xaden and my chest tightens So Freaking Beautiful Apparently my body doesnt care that hes as dangerous as they come in the quadrant because heat rushes through my veins flushing my skin Hes using a dagger to peel an apple removing the rind in one long curl and the blade continues its path as his eyes lift locking with mine My whole head tingles Gods is there any part of my body that doesnt physically react to the sight of him He glances toward Imogen and back to me and thats all it takes for me to know for certain Hes ordered her to help train me Xaden Riorson is now in the business of keeping his mortal enemy alive A few hours later after the squads are rearranged and the death roll is read all the firstyear riders in Fourth Wing stand in our newly issued flight leathers waiting in front of our dragons on the flight field The uniform is thicker than our usual one with a full jacket Ive buttoned over my dragonscale armor And unlike our regular uniforms whatever we choose them to be flight leathers bear no insignia besides our rank at our shoulder and any leadership designation No names No patches Nothing that could give us away if were separated from our dragons behind enemy lines Just a lot of sheaths for weapons I try not to think about possibly fighting in the war effort one day and focus on the organized chaos evolving on the flight field this morning I cant miss the way the other cadets look at Tairn or the wide berth the other dragons give him Honestly if I had those teeth bared at me Id back away too No you wouldnt because you didnt You stayed and defended Andarna His voice fills my head and I can tell from his tone there are places hed rather be Only because there was a lot going on at the moment I respond Andarna isnt coming this morning She has no need for flight lessons when she cant bear you Good point Though it would have been nice to see her Shes quieter in my head too not as meddlesome as Tairn I heard that Now pay attention I roll my eyes but focus on what Kaori is saying from the center of the field His hand is up using common lesser magic to project his voice so we can all hear God help us when Ridoc figures out how to do that I bite back a smile knowing hell find some way to annoy the shit out of every rider in the quadrant not just his squad and at only ninetytwo riders you are our smallest class to date My shoulders dip I thought a hundred and one were willing to bond plus you Willing doesnt mean they found worthy riders Tairn answers And yet two of you chose me With fortyone unbonded Thats quite the insult Youre worthy At least I think you are but you apparently dont pay attention in class He chuffs and a warm puff of steam blasts the back of my neck There are fortyone unbonded riders who would kill to be standing where you are Kaori continues And your dragons know that your bond is at its weakest point right now so if you fall if you fail theres a good chance your dragon might let you if it thinks the unbonded will be a better choice Comforting I mutter Tairn makes a noise that reminds me of a scoff Now were going to mount then follow a series of specific maneuvers your dragons already know Your orders are simple today Stay in your seat Kaori finishes Then he turns and breaks into a sprint racing the dozen feet toward his dragons foreleg and making the vertical climb to mount Just like the last obstacle on the Gauntlet I swallow wishing I hadnt eaten so much for breakfast and turn to face Tairn To my left and right other riders are doing the same mounting maneuver Theres no way I can pull that off normally let alone with my ankle still healing Tairn dips his shoulder and makes his leg into a ramp for me Defeat just about swallows me whole Ive bonded the biggestand certainly grumpiestdragon in the quadrant and yet he has to make accommodations for me Theyre accommodations for me Ive seen your memories Im not about to have you sticking daggers into my leg to climb up Now lets go I snort but make the ascent shaking my head as I navigate his spikes to find the seat My thighs ache from yesterday and I wince as I get into position gripping the pommel of scales Kaoris dragon launches into the sky Hold tight I feel the same bands of energy clamp around my legs and Tairn crouches a millisecond before he hurls us skyward The wind tears at my eyes as my stomach falls away and I risk holding on with one hand to lower my flight goggles Immediate relief We had to go second I ask Tairn as we fly out of the canyon and higher into the mountain range I get it now why I didnt see the dragons training often even though Ive basically grown up at Basgiath The only people around us are other riders Everyone is going to see when I slide right off I only agreed to follow Smachd because his rider is your instructor So youre an infront kind of guy Good to know Remind me to spend some time at temple so I can make multiple appeals to Dunne I keep my focus on Kaori watching for when the maneuvers will start The goddess of strength and war Tairn clearly scoffs this time What dragons dont think we need the gods on our side Shit its cold up here My gloved hands tighten on the pommel Dragons pay no heed to your puny gods Kaori banks right and Tairn follows suit leading us into a steep dive down the face of one of the peaks I clench with my legs but I know its Tairn keeping me in the seat He holds me there through another climb and even a nearspiral of a turn and I cant help but notice that hes taking everything Kaori is doing and making it harder You cant hold me here the entire time you know Watch me Unless youd rather be scraped off the glacier below like Gleanns rider back there I whip my head around to look but all I see is Tairns tail swinging his massive spikes blocking the view Dont look We already lost a rider My throat knots Gleann chose poorly He never bonds strongly anyway Oh My God If you keep holding me like this your energy will go into keeping me on instead of channeling when we need power for battle I argue Its a minuscule amount of my power How the hell am I supposed to be a rider if I cant stay on my damn dragon by myself Have it your way The bands fall away Thank yoooooh shit He banks left and my thighs slip My hands slide I skid right off his side my fingers fumbling for purchase and finding none Rushing air fills my ears as I plummet toward the glacier raw fear gripping my heart and squeezing like a vise The shape of a body below grows bigger and bigger Im yanked upward as Tairns claws catch me harnessing me just like he did during Threshing He climbs high then tosses me again but at least Im prepared for impact this time as his back rises to meet my falling bottom Theres a disgusted roar of something I dont understand in my head What the hell does that mean I scramble for the seat and get myself into position as he flies level The closest translation for humans is probably for fucks sake Now Are you going to stay in your seat this time He dips back into formation and I manage to stay on I have to be able to do this by myself We both need me to do this I argue Stubborn silver human Tairn mutters following Kaori into a dive I fall again And again And again Later that evening after dinner I make my way to the sparring gym Everything hurts from how many times I slid off Tairns back and Im pretty sure there are bruises under my arms from him catching me Im through the rotunda and crossing into the academic wing when I hear Dain calling my name jogging to catch up with me I wait for that familiar swell of happiness that we might have a minute alone but it doesnt come Instead theres a sea of awkwardness that I dont know how to navigate What the hell is wrong with me Dain is gorgeous and kind and a really really good man Hes honorable and my very best friend So why dont we have any chemistry Rhiannon said you were headed this way he says once he reaches my side concern knitting his brow Im going to work out I force a smile as we turn the corner where the gym is just ahead of us the large arched doors open You didnt get enough during flight today He touches my shoulder and stops so I do too pivoting to face him in the empty hallway I definitely fell enough today I check the bandage on my arm At least I didnt tear open my stitches His jaw works I honestly thought youd be all right once Tairn chose you And I will be I assure him my voice rising I just need to strengthen my muscles to stay seated through maneuvers and Tairn insists on making everything harder than what Kaori is doing For your own good Are you always around I snap back mentally Yes Get used to it I fight the urge to growl at the intrusive overbearing Still here Violet Dain asks Sorry Im not used to Tairn butting into my thoughts Its a good sign Means your bond is strengthening And honestly Im not sure why hes giving you a hard time with maneuvers Its not like theres any aerial threat out there besides gryphons and we all know one breath of fire means those birds are goners Tell him to ease up on you Tell him to mind his own business Illuhdo that I bite back a laugh Take it easy on him Hes my best friend Tairn snorts A sigh rips from Dains lips and he palms my face gently his gaze dropping to my lips for a heartbeat before he steps back Look About last night The part where you told me Xaden would get me killed if I bonded Tairn Or the part where you kissed me I fold my arms across my chest careful with my right The kiss he admits his voice lowering Itit never should have happened Relief courses through me Right I crack a smile Thank gods he feels the same way And it doesnt mean were not friends The best of friends he agrees but his eyes are heavy with a sadness I dont understand And its not that I dont want you What My eyebrows rise What are you saying Are our wires somehow crossed Im saying the same thing you are Two lines appear between his brows Its incredibly frowned upon to have a physical relationship with anyone in our chain of command Oh Yeah that definitely isnt what Im saying And you know how hard Ive worked to be a squad leader Im determined to be a wingleader next year and as much as you mean to me He shakes his head Oh This is all about politics for him Right I nod slowly I get it It shouldnt matter that the only reason he isnt pursuing me is rank and it honestly doesnt But it definitely makes me lose a little respect for him which is something I never expected And maybe next year if youre in a different wing or even after graduation he starts hope lighting up his eyes Sorrengail lets go I am not sitting around all night Imogen calls from the doorway her arms folded across her chest If our squad leader is done with you that is Dain rears back glancing between Imogen and me Shes training you She offered I shrug Squad loyalty and all that Blah blah Imogen offers a smile that doesnt reach her eyes Dont worry Ill take good care of her Bye Aetos I toss Dain a quick smile and walk away refusing to look over my shoulder to see if hes still there She quickly follows after me then leads me toward the corner on the left where glass meets stone and pushes open a door Ive never taken the time to notice before The room is lit with mage lights and full of a variety of wooden machinery with racks and ropes and pulleys benches with levers and bars attached to the wall And on the other side doing pushups on a mat is one of the firstyear Tyrs I saw in the woods that night Garrick crouched down next to her urging her on Dont worry Sorrengail Imogen coos in a saccharinesweet tone Theres only three of us in here Youre perfectly safe Garrick turns his gaze meeting mine even as he continues calling off reps for the other firstyear He nods once then goes back to his task Youre the only one I worry about I say as she leads me to a machine with a polished wooden seat and two cushioned squares that meet in front of it at knee height She laughs and I think its the first genuine sound Ive heard her make Fair point Since we cant work that ankle of yours or your arms until they heal were going to start with the most important muscles you have for staying on a dragon She glances down my body and sighs with obvious distaste Those weakass inner thighs Youre only doing this because Xaden is making you right I ask parking my ass in the seat of the machine with the cushioned wood between my knees as she makes adjustments Her eyes meet mine and narrow Rule number one Hes Riorson to you firstyear and you never get to question me about him Ever Thats two rules Im starting to think my first guess about them is right With that kind of fierce loyalty they have to be lovers I am not jealous Nope That pit of ugliness spreading inside my chest isnt jealousy It cant be She scoffs and pulls a lever that puts immediate tension on the wood and they rush outward separating my thighs Now get to work Push them back together Thirty reps There is nothing more sacred than the Archives Even temples can be rebuilt but books can not be rewritten Colonel Daxtons Guide to Excelling in the Scribe Quadrant CHAPTER EIGHTEEN The wooden library cart squeaks as I push it over the bridge that connects the Riders Quadrant to the Healer and then past the clinic doors into the heart of Basgiath Mage lights illuminate my way down the tunnels as I take a path so familiar that I could walk it with my eyes shut The scent of earth and stone fills my lungs the deeper I descend and the stab of longing thats hit me nearly every day for the past month since I was assigned to Archives duty isnt quite as sharp as it was yesterday and that wasnt as sharp as the day before I nod to the firstyear scribe at the entrance to the Archives and he jumps out of his seat hurrying to open the vaultlike door Good morning Cadet Sorrengail he says holding the entrance open so I can pass I missed you yesterday Good morning Cadet Pierson I offer him a smile as I push the cart through As quadrant chores go Ive scored my favorite I wasnt feeling well Id had dizzy spells all day no doubt from not drinking enough water but at least Id been able to rest The Archives smell like parchment bookbinding glue and ink They smell like home Rows of twentyfoothigh shelves run the length of the cavernous structure and I soak in the sight as I wait by the table nearest the entrance the place where I spent the majority of my hours these past five years Only scribes may pass any farther and I am a rider The thought brings a smile to my lips as a woman approaches in a cream tunic and hood a single rectangle of gold woven onto her shoulder A firstyear When she pulls the fabric from her head baring long brown hair and brings her gaze to meet mine I fullon grin I sign Jesinia Cadet Sorrengail she signs back Her bright eyes sparkle but she smothers her smile For just this second I abhor the rituals and customs of the scribes There would be nothing wrong with pulling my friend into a hug but shed be chastised for a loss of composure After all how could we know how earnest the scribes are about their work how dedicated they remain if they were to crack a smile Its really good to see you I sign and cant quit grinning I knew youd pass the test Only because I studied with you for the past year she signs back pressing her lips together so they dont curve upward Then her face falls I was horrified to hear about you being forced into the Riders Quadrant Are you all right Im fine I assure her then pause to search my memory for the correct sign for a dragon bond Im bonded and My feelings are complicated but I think about the way it felt to soar on Tairns back the gentle nudges from Andarna to keep going when I thought my muscles might give out during Imogens training sessions and my relationships with my friends and I cant deny the truth Im happy Her eyes widen Arent you constantly worried youre going to She glances left and right but theres no one near enough to see us You knowdie Sure I nod But oddly enough you kind of get used to that If you say so She looks skeptical Lets get you taken care of Are these all returns I nod and reach into the pocket of my pants for a small scroll of parchment and hand it to her before signing And a few requests from Professor Devera The rider in charge of our small library sends a list of requests and the returns every night and I fetch them before breakfast which is probably why my stomach is growling Burning all the extra calories from a combination of flight Rhiannons sparring lessons and Imogens torture sessions means I have an allnew capacity for food Anything else she asks after putting the scroll in a hidden pocket in her robes Maybe its being in the Archives but a stab of homesickness nearly bowls me over Any chance you guys have a copy of The Fables of the Barren Mira was right I had no business bringing the book of fables with me but it would be nice to spend an evening curled up with a familiar story Jesinias brow furrows Im not familiar with that text I blink Its not for academics or anything just a collection of folklore my dad shared with me A little on the dark side honestly but I love it I think for a moment Theres no sign for wyvern or venin so I spell them out Wyvern venin magic the battles of good and evilyou know the good stuff I grin If anyone understands my love of books its Jesinia Ive never heard of that one but Ill look for it while I pull these Thank you Id really appreciate it Now that Im going to be the one wielding magic I could use a few good folktales of what happens when humans defile the power channeled to them No doubt they were written as a parable to warn us of the dangers of bonding dragons but in Navarres sixhundredyear history of unification Ive never read of a single rider losing their soul to their powers The dragons keep us from that Jesinia nods and pushes the cart disappearing into the shelves It usually takes about fifteen minutes to gather the requests that come in from both professors and cadets in my quadrant but Im more than content to wait Scribes come and go some in groups as they train to become our kingdoms historians and I find myself staring at every hooded figure searching for a face I know I cant findsearching for my father Violet I turn to the left and see Professor Markham leading a squad of firstyear scribes Hello Professor Keeping my face emotionless around him is easier because I know hell expect it I didnt realize you had library chore duty He glances toward the spot in the shelves where Jesinia disappeared Are you being helped Jesinia I cringe I mean Cadet Neilwart is most helpful You know he says to the squad of five as they arc around me Cadet Sorrengail here was my prized student until the Riders Quadrant stole her away His gaze meets mine under his hood I had hopes she would return but alas she has bonded to not one but two dragons A girl to his right gasps then covers her mouth and mutters an apology Dont worry I felt the same way I tell her Perhaps you can explain something to Cadet Nasya over here who was just griping that theres not nearly enough fresh air in here Professor Markham turns his focus to a boy on his left This group is just starting their rotation in the Archives Nasya turns beet red under his cream hood Its part of the fire mitigation system I tell him Less air less risk of our history burning to the ground And the stuffy hoods Nasya lifts a brow at me Makes it harder for you to stand out against the tomes I explain A symbol that no one and nothing is more important than the documents and books in this very room My gaze darts around the chamber and a new pang of homesickness hits me Exactly Professor Markham levels a glare at Nasya Now if youll excuse us Cadet Sorrengail we have work to attend Ill see you tomorrow in Battle Brief Yes sir I step back giving the squad room to pass You are sad Andarna asks her voice soft Just visiting the Archives No need to worry I tell her Its hard to love a second home as much as the first I swallow Its easy when the second home is the right one And that is what the Riders Quadrant has become to methe right home The longing for the kind of peace and solitude I found only here cant match the adrenaline rush of flight Jesinia reappears with the cart laden down with the requested books and bits of mail for the professors of my quadrant She signs Im so sorry but I couldnt find that book I even searched the catalog for wyvernI think thats what you saidbut theres nothing I stare for a second Our Archives have either a copy or the original of almost every book in Navarre Only ultrarare or forbidden tomes are excluded When did folklore become either of those Though come to think of it I never came across anything like The Fables of the Barren on the shelves while I was studying to become a scribe Chimera Yes Kraken Sure But wyvern or the venin that create them None Bizarre Thats all right Thank you for looking I sign back You look different she signs then hands the cart over My eyes widen Not bad different justdifferent Your face is leaner and even your posture She shakes her head Ive been training I pause my hands hanging by my sides while I consider my answer Its hard but great too Im getting quicker on the mat The mat Her brow furrows For sparring Right I forget that you guys fight each other too Sympathy fills her eyes Im really all right I promise her leaving out the times Ive caught Oren gripping a dagger in my presence or the way Jack seethes in my direction How about you Is it everything you wanted Its everything and more So much more The responsibility we have not only to record history but to speed information from the front lines is more than I ever could have imagined and its so fulfilling She presses her lips together again Good Im happy for you And I mean it But I worry for you She sucks in a breath The uptick in attacks along the border Concern etches lines into her forehead I know We hear about them in Battle Brief Its always the same striking at faltering wards ransacking villages high in the mountains and more dead riders My heart breaks every time we get a report and a part of me shuts down with each attack that I have to analyze And Dain she asks as we head for the door Have you seen him My smile falters Thats a story for another day She sighs Ill try and be here around this time so I can see you Sounds wonderful I refrain from pulling her into a hug and walk through the door she opens By the time I return the cart to the library and make it through the lunch line our time is almost up which means Im busy shoveling food in my mouth as fast as I can while the members of our original squad chat around me The newbies two firstyears and two secondyears we took on when the third squad was dissolved are a table away Theyve refused to sit with anyone with a rebellion relic So fuck them It was the coolest thing ever Ridoc continues One second he was sparring against that thirdyear with the wicked broadsword skills and then Sawyer You could let him tell the story Rhiannon chides rolling her eyes No thank you Sawyer counters shaking his head staring at his fork with a hefty dose of fear Ridoc grins in all his glory telling the story And then the sword just twists in Sawyers hand curving toward the thirdyear even though Sawyer was way off the mark He grimaces in Sawyers direction Sorry man but you were If your sword hadnt decided to warp and go straight for that guys arm Youre a metallurgist Quinns eyebrows rise Really Holy crap Sawyer can manipulate metals I force down a little more turkey and openly stare at him As far as I know hes the first of us to display any form of power let alone a signet Sawyer nods Thats what Carr says Aetos dragged me straight to the professor when he saw it happen Im so jealous Ridoc grabs his chest I want my signet power to manifest You wouldnt be so excited if it meant you werent sure if your fork would stab into the roof of your mouth because you cant control it yet Sawyer shoves his tray away Good point Ridoc looks at his own tray Youll manifest when your dragon is ready to trust you with all that power Quinn says then finishes off her water Just hope your dragons trust you before about six months and She makes a sound like an explosion and mimics it with her hands Stop scaring the children Imogen says That hasnt happened inshe pauses to thinkdecades When we all stare at her she rolls her eyes Look the relic your dragons transferred onto you at Threshing is the conduit to let all that magic into your body If you dont manifest a signet and let it out then after a bunch of months bad things happen We all gawk The magic consumes you Quinn adds making the explosion sound again Relax its not like a hard deadline or something Its just an average Imogen shrugs Fuck me its always something around here Ridoc mutters Feeling a little luckier now Sawyer says staring at his fork Well get you some wooden utensils I tell Sawyer And you should probably avoid the armory or sparring withanything Sawyer scoffs Thats the truth At least Ill be safe during flight this afternoon Adding flight classes to our schedule has been essential since Threshing The wings rotate for access to the flight field and today is one of our lucky days of the week I feel a tingle in my scalp and know if I turn Ill find Xaden watching us Watching me But I dont give him the satisfaction of looking He hasnt said so much as a word to me since Threshing That doesnt mean Im aloneoh Im never alone Theres always an upperclassman somewhere near when Im walking the halls or headed to the gym at night And they all have rebellion relics I like it better when we have it in the morning Rhiannon says her face souring Its way worse after weve eaten breakfast and lunch Agreed I manage between mouthfuls Finish the turkey Imogen orders Ill see you tonight She and Quinn clear their trays taking them back to the window for scullery Is she any nicer when shes training you Rhiannon asks No But shes efficient I finish the turkey as the room begins to clear and we all make our way toward the scullery window Whats Professor Carr like I ask Sawyer then tuck my tray onto the stack The wielding professor is one of the only ones I havent met since I havent manifested a signet Fucking terrifying Sawyer answers I cant wait for the entire year to start wielding lessons so everyone can enjoy his particular brand of instruction We head out through commons and the rotunda and into the courtyard all buttoning up our coats November has hit hard with gusty winds and frosted grass in the morning and the first snow isnt far behind I knew it would work Jack Barlowe says ahead of us dragging someone under his arm and thumping her head affectionately Isnt that Caroline Ashton Rhiannon asks her mouth hanging open as Caroline heads toward the academic wing with Jack Yeah Ridoc tenses She bonded Gleann this morning Wasnt he already bonded Rhiannon watches them until they disappear into the wing His rider died on our first flight lesson I focus on the gate ahead that leads to the flight field So I guess the unbonded still have that shot theyre looking for Rhiannon mutters Yeah Sawyer nods his features tense They do You only fell about a dozen times that trip Tairn remarks as we land on the flight field I cant tell if thats a compliment or not I take deep breaths and try to calm my racing heart Take it as you wish I mentally roll my eyes and scoot out of the seat as he dips his shoulder so I can slide down his foreleg The move has become so practiced that I barely even notice that other riders are capable of leaping to the ground or descending the proper way Besides you could make it easier you know Oh I know Im not the one putting us into spirals with steep banks while Kaori is teaching plain dives My feet hit the ground of the field and I arch an eyebrow at Tairn Im training you for battle Hes teaching you parlor tricks He blinks a golden eye at me and looks away Do you think we can get Andarna to join us next week Even if its just to fly along I do all the checks Kaori has taught us looking for any debris that could have lodged between the long taloned toes of Tairns claws or between the rockhard scales of his underbelly Im not foolish enough to not know that I have something stuck in my flesh And I wouldnt ask Andarna to join us unless she requested it She cant keep up the speed and it would only draw unwanted attention I never get to see her I blatantly whine Im always stuck with your grumpy ass Im always here Andarna answers but theres no flicker of gold Shes most likely in the Vale as usual but at least shes protected there This grumpy ass just caught you a dozen times Silver One Eventually you could call me Violet you know I take the time to examine every row of his scales One of the biggest dangers to dragons are the smallest things they cant remove that penetrate between the scales causing infection I know he repeats And I could call you Violence like the wingleader You wouldnt dare I narrow my eyes as I move forward checking where his chest begins to rise And you know how much that ass annoys me Annoys you Tairn chuckles above me the sound like a chuffing cat Is that what you call it when your heart rate Dont even start with me A growl rumbles through Tairns chest above me and vibrates my very bones I pivot my hands hovering along my sheathed daggers as Dain approaches Its just Dain I walk out from between Tairns forelegs when Dain pauses a dozen feet away Anger does not suit him He growls again and a puff of steam hits the back of my neck Relax I say and glance back over my shoulder at him My eyebrows shoot up Tairns golden eyes are narrowed in a glare on Dain and his teeth are bared dripping saliva as another growl rumbles Youre a menace Stop it I say Tell him if he harms you Ill scorch the ground where he stands Oh for fucks sake Tairn I roll my eyes and walk to Dain whose jaw is locked but his eyes are wide with apprehension Tell him or Ill take it up with Cath Tairn says if you harm me hell burn you I say as dragons to the left and right launch skyward without their riders headed back to the Vale But not Tairn Nope hes still standing behind me like an overprotective dad Im not going to harm you Dain snaps Word for word Silver One I blow a breath out slowly Sorry he actually said if you harm me hell scorch the ground where you stand I turn and look over my shoulder Better Tairn blinks Dain keeps his eyes on me but I see it there the swirling anger Tairn warned me about I would rather die than harm you and you know it Happy now I ask Tairn Im hungry I think Ill partake in a flock of sheep He launches with great beats of his wings I need to talk to you Dains voice drops and he narrows his eyes Fine Walk me back I motion at Rhiannon to go on without me and she walks ahead with the others leaving Dain and me to bring up the rear We fall back at the edge of the field Why didnt you tell me you cant keep your fucking seat he shouts at me grabbing my elbow Im sorry I yank my arm out of his hold Tairn growls in my mind Ive got this I shout back at him All this time Ive been letting Kaori teach you thinking he must have everything under control After all if the rider of the strongest dragon in the quadrant couldnt keep her seat then surely wed all know He rips his hand over his hair Surely I would know if my best friend fell every fucking day that she flew Its not a secret Anger bubbles in my veins Everyone in our wing knows Im sorry if you havent been keeping tabs on your squad but trust me Dain Everyone knows And Im not going to stand here while you lecture me like Im a child I stalk off my strides eating up the ground as I follow my wing You didnt tell me he says anger in his voice giving way to hurt as he catches up more than matching my pace Theres not a problem I shake my head Tairn can keep me buckled in magically if he needs to Im the one asking him to loosen the restraints And Id think twice before you question him Hes more of the charfirstaskquestionslater type Its a huge problem because he cant channel His full powers I ask as we make it out of the field heading toward the steps that descend next to the Gauntlet I know that Why do you think Im up there asking him to loosen up Frustration is a living breathing thing inside me eating up all rational thought Youve been flying for a month and youre still falling His voice follows me down the staircase So is half the wing Dain Not a dozen times they arent he shoots back Hes on my heels as I pick up my pace toward the path that will lead back to the citadel the gravel crunching beneath my boots I just want to help you Vi How can I help I sigh at the plaintive tone in his voice I keep forgetting this is my best friend and hes having to watch me risk my life every day I dont know how Id feel if our roles were reversed Probably just as concerned So I try to lighten the mood and say You should have seen me a month ago when it was three dozen times Three dozen His voice rises on the last word I halt at the mouth of the tunnel and offer a smile It sounds worse than it is Dain I promise Will you at least tell me what part of flight you have trouble with At least let me help you You want a list of my flaws I roll my eyes My thighs are too weak but Im building muscle My hands cant grip the pommel but theyre getting stronger It took weeks for my biceps to heal so Im training that one too But you dont have to worry about me DainImogen is training me Because Riorson asked her to he guesses folding his arms across his chest Probably Why does it matter Because he doesnt have your best interest at heart He shakes his head looking more like a stranger than Ive ever seen him before First it was bending the rules to make it up the Gauntlet and yes Amber lit into me for an hour about how you acted dishonorably Dishonorably Fuck this And you just took her word for it Without asking me what happened Shes a wingleader Vi Im not about to question her integrity I proved myself with the Codex and Riorson accepted it Hes a wingleader too Fine You made it up Dont get me wrong I couldnt stand myself if something happened to you whether you were handling the trial the right or wrong way And then I thought youd be fine if you survived Threshing but even bonded to the strongest of them He shakes his head Go ahead Say it My hands curl into fists my nails biting into my palms Im terrified youre not going to make it to graduation Vi His shoulders slump You know exactly how I feel about you whether or not I can do anything about it and Im terrified Its that last line that does me in Laughter bubbles up through my throat and escapes His eyes widen This place cuts away the bullshit and the niceties revealing whoever you are at your core I repeat his words from this summer Isnt that what you said to me Is this who you really are at your core Someone so enamored with rules that he doesnt know when to bend or break them for someone he cares about Someone so focused on the least Im capable of doing he cant believe I can do so much more The warmth drains from his brown eyes Lets get one thing straight Dain I take a step closer but the distance between us only widens The reason well never be anything more than friends isnt because of your rules Its because you have no faith in me Even now when Ive survived against all odds and bonded not just one dragon but two you still think I wont make it So forgive me but youre about to be some of the bullshit that this place cuts away from me I move to the side and march past him through the tunnel forcing air through my lungs Other than the last year when he entered the Riders Quadrant I cant remember a time without Dain in my life But I cant take his constant pessimism about my future anymore Sunlight overpowers me for a second as I walk into the courtyard Classes are out for the afternoon and I see Xaden and Garrick leaned up against the wall of the academic building like gods surveying their domain Xaden arches a dark eyebrow as I pass by I flip him the middle finger Im not taking his shit today either Everything all right Rhiannon asks as I catch up to her and the guys Dain is an ass Make it stop someone screams rushing down the steps of the rotunda and holding his head Its a firstyear in Third Wing who sits two rows beneath me in Battle Brief and perpetually drops his quill For gods sake make it stop he shrieks stumbling into the courtyard My hands hover over my blades A shadow moves to my left and a glance tells me Xaden has moved casually putting himself just ahead of me The crowd hollows forming a circle around the firstyear as he screams clutching his head Jeremiah someone shouts coming forward You Jeremiah spins pointing his finger at the thirdyear You think Ive lost it His head tilts and his eyes flare How does he know He shouldnt know His tone shifts like the words arent his own Chills race down my spine dragging my stomach to the ground And you He spins again pointing at a secondyear in First Wing What the hell is wrong with him Why is he screaming He turns again focused on Dain Is Violet going to hate me forever Why cant she see that I just want to keep her alive How is he Hes reading my thoughts The impression is uncanny embarrassing and terrifying Oh gods I whisper my heart thundering so loud I can hear the pounding blood in my ears Forget the embarrassment Who cares if people know Dain is thinking about me Jeremiahs signet power is manifesting He can read mindsan inntinnsic His power is a death sentence Ridoc stumbles backward on my leftshoved asideand I dont need to look to know whose muscled arm now brushes my shoulder The scent of mint somehow steadies my heartbeat Jeremiah unsheathes his shortsword Make it stop Cant any of you see The thoughts wont stop His panic is palpable clogging my own throat Do something I beg Xaden glancing up at him His unwavering lethal focus is on Jeremiah but his body tenses at my plea poised ready to strike Start mentally reciting whatever bookish shit youve learned Im sorry I hiss up at him If you value your secrets clear your thoughts Now Xaden orders Oh Shit Nothing comes to mind and were clearly in imminent danger Um Many Navarrian defense posts exist beyond the safety of our wards Such posts are considered to be in a zone of imminent danger and should only be staffed by military personnel and never the civilians who usually accompany them And you Jeremiah turns his gaze locking on Garrick Damn it all to hell Hell know about The shadows around Jeremiahs feet snake up his legs in a heartbeat winding around his chest until they cover his mouth in bands of black I swallow the boulder in my throat A professor pushes through the crowd his shock of white hair bouncing with every step of his large frame Hes an inntinnsic someone shouts and that seems to be all thats necessary The professor grips Jeremiahs head with both hands and a crack echoes off the walls of the silent courtyard Xadens shadows melt away and Jeremiah falls to the ground his head at an unnatural macabre angle His neck is broken The professor bends down and lifts Jeremiahs body with surprising strength carrying him into the rotunda Xaden inhales sharply beside me then walks away with Garrick headed toward the academic wing Nice to see you too Maybe I dont want a signet power after all Ridoc murmurs That death is merciful compared to what will happen if you dont manifest one Dain says and I swear I start to feel my relics burn across my back even though my dragons havent started channeling And that Sawyer says from Rhiannons side was Professor Carr You always have to check your sources Dad tells me ruffling my hair as he stands beside me at the table in the Archives Remember that firsthand accounts are always more accurate but you have to look deeper Violet You have to see who is telling the story But what if I want to be a rider I ask with the voice of a muchyounger version of me Like Brennan and Mom WAKE A familiar consuming voice rumbles through the Archives A voice that doesnt belong here Youre not like them Violet Thats not your path Dad offers me an apologetic smile the usual kind that says he sympathizes but theres nothing he can do the kind he gives me when Mom makes a choice he doesnt agree with And its for the best Your mother has never understood that while riders may be the weapons of our kingdom its the scribes who have all the real power in this world Wake before you die The bookshelves in the Archives tremble and my heart jolts Now My eyes fly open and I gasp as the dream disintegrates Im not in the Archives Im in my room in the Riders Move Tairn bellows Fuck Shes awake Moonlight reflects off a sword slicing through the air above me Oh Shit I roll toward the opposite side of my bed but not fast enough and the blade slams into the side of my back with a force even my thick winter blankets cant diffuse Adrenaline camouflages the pain as the sword rebounds unable to split the dragon scales My knees slam into the hardwood floor and I thrust my hands beneath my pillow drawing back two daggers as I untangle from the covers and gain my feet How the hell did they get my door unlocked Blowing my unbound hair out of my face I meet the wide shocked eyes of an unbonded firstyear and hes not the only one There are seven cadets in my room Four are unbonded men Three are unbonded womenI gasp with recognitionmake that two as she runs for the door and slams it on the way out She opened the door Theres no other explanation The rest are all armed All determined to kill me All standing between my unlocked door and me My hands curl around the hilts of my daggers and my heart rate skyrockets Guess it wont do me much good to ask you to leave nicely Im going to have to fight my way out of here Get away from the wall Dont let them trap you Good point But theres not exactly a lot of places to go in this tiny room Damn it I told you her armor is impenetrable Oren hisses from the other side of the room blocking my exit Fucking asshole I should have killed you during Threshing I admit My door is closed but surely someone will hear if I sc A woman lunges for me scrambling across my bed and I dodge sliding along the icy pane of the window The window Its too high Youll fall to the ravine and I cant get there fast enough No window Got it Another woman throws her knife rending the fabric of my nightgowns sleeve as it lodges in the armoire but she missed any flesh I spin leaving the sleeve behind as it rips away and flick my dagger as I round the end of my bed It lands in her shoulder my favorite target and she goes down with a cry clutching her wound The rest of my weapons are stored near the door Shit Shit Shit No more throwing things Keep ahold of that weapon For someone who cant help Tairn has no problem dishing out opinions You have to go for her throat Oren shouts Ill do it myself I move my blade to my right hand and fend off one attack from the left slicing her down her forearm and then another to the right stabbing into a mans thigh I kick out with my heel and catch another in the gut as he attacks sending him careening back onto my bed his sword tumbling after him But now Im cornered between my desk and the armoire There are too many of them And they all rush at the same damn time My dagger is kicked out of my hand with appalling ease and my heart seizes as Oren grips my throat yanking me toward him I sweep out for his knees but my bare feet make no impact as he lifts me off the ground cutting off my air supply as I kick for purchase No No No I dig my hands into his arm my fingernails puncturing his skin as I claw drawing blood He might bear my scars after this but his grip doesnt ease as he crushes my throat Air Theres no air Hes almost there Tairn promises panic lacing his tone He who I cant breathe Cant think Finish her one of the men yells Hell only respect us if we finish her Theyre after Tairn Tairns roar of rage fills my head as Oren lowers my body flipping me around as he curls his arm so my back is against his chest At least my feet are on the ground but the edge of my vision goes dark my lungs fighting for oxygen that isnt there The greedy eyes of a bleeding firstyear stare back into mine Do it she demands Your dragon is mine Oren hisses in my ear and his hand falls away replaced by a blade Air rushes into my lungs as cold metal caresses my throat the oxygen flooding my blood and clearing my head enough to realize this is it I am going to die From one heartbeat to what will probably be my last an overwhelming sorrow seizes my chest and I cant help but wonder if I would have made it Would I have been strong enough to graduate Would I have become worthy of Tairn and Andarna Would I have finally made my mother proud The knife tip touches my skin My bedroom door flies open the wood splintering as it slams against the stone wall but I dont have a chance to turn to see who is standing there before a shriek pierces my vision Mine Andarna screams Skinprickling energy zings down my spine then rushes to my fingertips and toes and the next breath I take is in total complete silence Go Andarna demands I blink and realize the firstyear in front of me doesnt She isnt breathing Isnt moving No one is Everyone in this room is frozen in placeexcept me In response to the Great War dragons claimed the western lands and gryphons the central ones abandoning the Barrens and the memory of General Daramor who nearly destroyed the Continent with his army Our allies sailed home and we began a period of peace and prosperity as the provinces of Navarre united for the first time behind the safety of our wards under the protection of the first bonded riders Navarre an Unedited History by Colonel Lewis Markham CHAPTER NINETEEN What The Hell Its as if everyone in my room has turned to stone but I know that cant be true Orens body is warm behind me his skin malleable under my fingers as I shift my grip and shove his bloody forearm forcing the blade away from my neck A single drop of blood drips from the sharp tip splattering on the hardwood and theres a trickle of wetness down my throat Quick I cant hold it Andarna urges her voice thready Shes doing this I gulp heaving breaths through my battered windpipe and duck under Orens forearm freeing myself then sidestep quickly in the silence Complete unearthly silence The clock on my desk isnt ticking as I squeeze between Orens elbow and a giant guy who used to be from Second Wing No one breathes Their gazes are frozen To the left the woman I sliced open is hunched over clutching her forearm and the man I stabbed is leaned against the wall on the right staring in horror at his thigh I mark time in thunderous heartbeats as I stumble into the only open space in my room but my path to the nowopen door isnt clear Xaden fills the doorway like some kind of dark avenging angel the messenger of the queen of the gods Hes fully dressed his face a mask of veritable rage as shadows curl from the walls on either side of him hanging in midair For the first time since crossing the parapet Im so fucking relieved to see him that I could cry Andarna gasps in my mindand chaos resumes Nausea clenches my stomach Its about damned time Tairn rumbles Xadens gaze snaps to mine his onyx eyes flaring in shock for no longer than a millisecond before he strides forward his shadows streaming before him as he stands at my side He snaps his fingers and the room illuminates mage lights hovering above us Youre all fucking dead His voice is eerily calm and all the scarier for it Every head in the room turns Riorson Orens dagger clatters to the floor You think surrendering will save you Xadens lethally soft tone sends goose bumps up my arms It is against our code to attack another rider in their sleep But you know he never should have bonded her Oren puts his hands up his palms facing us You of all people have reason enough to want the weakling dead Were just correcting a mistake Dragons dont make mistakes Xadens shadows grab every assailant but Oren by the throat then constrict They struggle but it doesnt matter Their faces turn purple the shadows holding tight as they sag to their knees falling in an arc in front of me like lifeless puppets I cant find it in my heart to pity them Xaden prowls forward as though he has all the time in the world and holds out his palm as yet another tendril of darkness lifts my discarded dagger from the floor Let me explain Oren eyes the dagger and his hands tremble Ive heard everything I need to hear Xadens fingers curl around the hilt She should have killed you in the field but shes merciful Thats not a flaw I possess He slashes forward so quickly that I barely catch the move and Orens throat opens in a horizontal line blood streaming down his neck and chest in a torrent He grabs for his throat but its useless He bleeds out in seconds crumpling to the floor A crimson puddle grows around him Damn Xaden Garrick walks in sheathing his sword as his gaze rakes over the room No time for questioning His glance sweeps to me as if cataloging injuries catching on my throat No need for it Xaden counters as Bodhi enters doing the same quick assessment Garrick had The similarity between the cousins still gives me pause Bodhi has the same bronzed skin and strong brow line but his features arent as angular as Xadens and his eyes are a lighter shade of brown He looks like a softer more approachable version of his older cousin but my body doesnt heat at the sight of him the way it does around Xaden Or maybe Oren just strangled the common sense out of me An illogical laugh bubbles up through my lips and all three men look at me like Ive hit my head Let me guess Bodhi says rubbing the back of his neck Were on cleanup Call in help if you need it Xaden answers with a nod Bodies Im alive Im alive Im alive I repeat the mantra in my head as Xaden wipes the blood from my dagger on the back of Orens tunic Yes Youre alive Xaden steps over Orens body and two others retrieving my dagger from the fallen womans shoulder before reaching my armoire I dont even recognize her and yet she tried to kill me Garrick and Bodhi haul out the first bodies I didnt realize Id said that out loud The trembling starts in my knees and then nausea overpowers me Fuck I thought Id worked past this kind of reaction to adrenaline but here I am shaking like a leaf as Xaden sorts through my armoire like he hasnt just taken out half a dozen people As if this kind of slaughter is commonplace Its the shock he says whipping my cloak from its hook and retrieving a pair of boots Are you hurt His words are clipped and break whatever temporary block I had on the pain It comes flooding back in a throbbing wave that centers in my back So much for the adrenaline rush Every breath feels like Im shoving my lungs against broken glass so I keep them short and shallow But I manage to stay on my feet retreating until I feel the stone wall against my uninjured side letting it take my weight Come on Violence His cajoling words are at odds with his terse tone as he folds my cloak over his arm and brings my boots through the remaining bodies hes left on my floor Pull your shit together and tell me where youre hurt Hes killed six people without so much as a spot of blood on his midnightblack leathers My boots hit the ground next to my feet and my cloak lands on the little armchair in the corner I can barely breathe but can I risk admitting my current weakness to him His fingers are warm under my chin as he tilts my head up so our gazes collide Waitis that a hint of panic swirling in his Youre breathing like crap so Im guessing it has to do with My ribs I finish before he can guess Trying to mask the pain isnt going to work with him The one by the bed hit the side of my ribs with the sword but I think theyre just bruised There hadnt been that telltale snap that comes with broken bones Must have been a dull sword He cocks a dark eyebrow Unless it has something to do with why you sleep in your leather vest Trust him Tairn demands Its not that easy It has to be for now Its dragonscale I lift my right arm and pivot slightly so he can see the gaping hole in my nightdress Mira made it for me Its why Ive lived this long He glances between our bodies his mouth tensing before he nods once Ingenious though Id say there are multiple reasons for why youve made it this far Before I can argue that point his gaze shifts to my throat and narrows at what I imagine has to be the purple imprint of a hand I should have killed him slower Im fine Im not His focus snaps back to my eyes Never lie to me He says it with such ferocity bit out through gritted teeth that I cant help but nod in promise It hurts I admit Let me see I open and shut my mouth twice Is that a request or a demand Your pick as long as I get to see if that fucker broke your ribs His hands curl into fists Two other men walk in through the open door Garrick and Bodhi following closely after Theyre alldressed Fully clothed atI glance at the clocktwo am Take those two and well get the last ones Garrick orders and the others get to work carrying the last of the bodies out through the door I cant help but notice they all have rebellion relics shimmering up their arms but I keep the observation to myself Thank you Xaden says then flicks his hand and my door shuts with a soft click Now let me see your ribs Were wasting time I swallow then nod Better to know now if theyre broken anyway I turn my back on him but I can see his face in the fulllength mirror as I shrug out of the billowing sleeves of my nightdress holding the material above my breasts as it dips in the back to my waist Youll have to I know how to handle a corset His jaw flexes once and something that reminds me of raw hunger flitters across his expression before he locks it down drawing my hair over my shoulder with surprising gentleness His fingers skim my bare skin and I suppress a shiver locking my muscles so I dont arch into his touch What the hell is wrong with me Theres still blood on my floor and yet my breaths are tight for the entirely wrong reason as he makes quick work of the laces starting at the bottom He wasnt lying He absolutely knows his way around a corset How the hell do you get yourself into this thing every morning he asks clearing his throat as inch after inch of my back is exposed Im freakishly flexible Its part of the whole bonessnapping jointstearing thing I answer over my shoulder Our eyes meet and warmth flutters through my stomach The moment is gone as quickly as it came and he pulls my armor apart inspecting my right side Gentle fingers stroke over the abused ribs then prod carefully You have one hell of a bruise but I dont think theyre broken Thats what I thought Thank you for checking It should be awkward but somehow it isnt even as he laces me back up securing the ends Youll live Turn around I do tugging my nightdress back over my shoulders and he drops to his knees on the floor before me My eyes widen Xaden Riorson is kneeling before me his black hair at the perfect level for me to run my fingers through the thickness Its probably the only thing thats soft about him How many women have felt those strands between their fingers Why the hell do I care Youre going to have to walk through the pain and we have to do it fast He grabs a boot then taps my foot Can you lift it up I nod lifting my foot Then he robs me of every logical thought by putting on my boots and lacing them one at a time This is the same man who had no problems with my death just a few months ago and my brain cant seem to wrap itself around the different sides of him Lets go He wraps my cloak around my shoulders and buttons it at my collar like Im something precious Now I know Im in shock because Im anything but precious to Xaden Riorson His gaze drifts over my hair and he blinks once before tugging my hood up over the fading darktolight mass Then he grasps my hand and tugs me into the hallway His fingers are strong as they curl around mine his grip firm but not too tight Every other door is shut The attack wasnt even loud enough to rouse my neighbors Id be dead by now if Xaden hadnt shown up even if I had managed to get out of Orens hold But how did that happen Where are we going The hallways are dimly lit by blue mage lights the kind that signal its still night for those without windows Keep talking loud enough for others to hear and someone will stop us before we get anywhere Cant you just hide us in shadows or something Sure because a giant black cloud moving down the hallway isnt going to look more suspicious than a couple sneaking around He shoots me a look that keeps me from countering Point taken Not that were a couple Not that I wouldnt climb the man like a tree if presented with the right set of circumstances I cringe as we make it to the main hallway of the dormitory There will never ever be a right set of circumstances when it comes to him let alone right after hes executed half a dozen people But in my defense and in a sick twisted way his rescue was pretty damned hot even if he is hauling me down the hallway at an untenable speed Even if he only did it because my life is tied to his My chest screams for a break but theres none to be found as he leads me past the spiral staircase that leads up to the second and thirdyear dorms and into the rotunda Its going to take weeks for my ribs to fully heal Our boots against the marble floor are the only sounds as we pass into the academic wing Instead of turning left toward the sparring gym he takes us right down a set of stairs that I know leads to storage Halfway down the steps he pauses and I nearly run into the sword strapped to his back Then he gestures with his right hand keeping mine in his left Click Xaden pushes on the stones and a hidden door swings open Holy shit I whisper at the expansive tunnel revealed before us Hope youre not afraid of the dark He pulls me inside and suffocating darkness envelops us as the door closes This is fine This is absolutely fine But just in case you are Xaden says his voice at full volume as he snaps A mage light hovers above our head illuminating our surroundings Thanks The tunnel is supported by arches of stone and the floor is smooth as though its been traveled more than its entrance lets on It smells like earth but isnt dank and it goes on for what seems like an eternity He drops my hand and starts walking Keep up You could I wince Fuck my chest hurts Be a little more considerate I trudge after him dropping my hood Im not going to baby you like Aetos does he says without turning around Thats only going to get you killed once we get out of Basgiath He doesnt baby me He does and you know it You hate it too if the vibe Im picking up on is any indication He falls back to walk at my side Or did I read that wrong He thinks this place is too dangerous for someonelike me and after what just happened Im not sure I can really argue with him I was asleep Thats the only time were supposed to be guaranteed safety around here I dont think Ill bother sleeping again I shoot a look sideways at his irritatingly gorgeous profile And if you even think about suggesting that you sleep with me for safety from now on He scoffs Hardly I dont fuck firstyearseven when I was onelet aloneyou Who said anything about fucking I fire back cursing myself as the ache in my ribs only intensifies Id have to be a masochist to sleep with you and I can assure you Im not Fantasizing about it doesnt count Masochist huh A corner of his mouth quirks into a smirk You hardly give off snuggly morningafter vibes A smile of my own curves my lips Unless youre worried about me killing you while we sleep We round a corner and the tunnel continues I have zero concern about that As violent as you are and skilled with those daggers Im not even sure you could kill a fly Dont think I didnt notice that you managed to wound three of them and never went for a kill shot He shoots a disapproving look my way Ive never killed anyone I whisper like its a secret Youre going to have to get over that All we are after graduation are weapons and its best if were honed before leaving the gates Is that where were going Are we leaving the gates Ive lost all sense of direction in here Were going to ask Tairn what the hell just happened Xadens jaw flexes And Im not talking about the attack How the hell did they get past your locks I shrug but dont bother to explain Theres no way hell believe me I barely believe it myself Wed better figure it out so it doesnt happen again I refuse to sleep on your fucking floor like some kind of guard dog Wait This is another way to the flight field I do my best to mentally wall off the pain in my throat and ribs Hes bringing me to you I tell Tairn I know Are you going to tell me what that was in there I would if I knew Yes Xaden says and the path curves again Its not exactly common knowledge And Im going to ask you to tuck this little tunnel into the file of secrets you keep on my behalf Let me guess and youll know if I tell Yes Another smirk appears and I look away before he can catch me staring Are you going to promise me another favor The path begins to climb and the ascent is anything but gentle Every breath reminds me of what happened less than an hour ago Having one of my favors is more than enough and weve already reached mutually assured destruction status Sorrengail Now can you push through it or do you need me to carry you That sounds like an insult not an offer Youre catching on But his pace slows to match mine The ground shifts beneath my feet as though its rocking but I know better Its my head the result of the pain and stress My steps wobble Xadens arm wraps around my waist steadying me I hate how his touch elevates my heart rate as we continue the climb but I dont protest I dont want to be grateful for anything when it comes to him but man if that minty scent of his isnt delicious What were you doing tonight anyway What makes you ask His tone clearly insinuates that I shouldnt Too bad You made it to my room within minutes and youre not exactly dressed for sleeping Hes strapped with a sword for crying out loud Maybe I sleep in my armor too Then you should pick more trustworthy bedmates He snorts a flash of a smile appearing for a heartbeat A real one Not the fake forced sneer Im used to seeing or the cocky little smirk An honest heartstopping smile that Im anything but immune to Its gone as fast as it appears though So youre not going to tell me I ask Id be frustrated if I didnt hurt so damned much And Im not even going to touch why he needed to haul us all the way to Tairn when I can chat with him anytime I want Unless he wants to talk to Tairn which isballsy Nope Thirdyear business He lets go when we reach the stonewalled end of the tunnel A few hand gestures and another click sounds before he pushes open the door We step out into crisp freezingly cold November air What the hell I whisper The door is built into a stack of boulders on the eastern side of the field Its camouflaged Xaden waves a hand and the door closes blending into the rock as if its a part of it Theres a sound I now recognize as the steady beat of wings and I look up to see the three dragons block out the stars as they descend The earth shudders as they land in front of us Im guessing the wingleader wants a word Tairn steps forward and Sgaeyl follows her wings tucked in tight her golden eyes narrowing on me Andarna scurries between Sgaeyls claws galloping toward us She skids the last dozen feet paws digging into the ground to stop just in front of me bringing her nose to my ribs as an urgent sense of anxiety fills my head swamping me with feelings I know arent mine No broken bones I promise stroking my hand over the bumpy ridges of her head Theyre just bruised Youre sure she asks worry widening her eyes As sure as I can be I force a smile Trudging out here in the middle of the night is worth it to alleviate her anxiety Yes I want a word What the hell kind of powers are you channeling to her Xaden demands staring up at Tairn like he isntTairn Yep Ballsy Every muscle in my body locks sure that Tairn is about to torch Xaden for impudence None of your business what I choose or do not choose to channel toward my rider Tairn answers with a growl This is going well He says I start I heard him Xaden counters not sparing me a glance You what My eyebrows hit my hairline and Andarna retreats to stand with the others Dragons only talk to their riders Thats what Ive always been taught Its absolutely my business when you expect me to protect her Xaden retorts his voice rising I got the message to you just fine human Tairns head swivels in that snakelike motion that puts me on alert Hes more than agitated And I barely made it The words come out clipped through clenched teeth She would have been dead if Id been thirty seconds later Seems like you had thirty seconds gifted to you Tairns chest rumbles with a growl And Id like to know what the fuck happened in there I inhale sharply Dont hurt him I beg Tairn He saved me Ive never seen someone so much as dare to speak to another riders dragon yet alone yell at one especially not one as powerful as Tairn He grumbles in response We need to know what happened in that room Xadens dark gaze cuts through me like a knife for a millisecond before he glares back at Tairn Do not dare to try and read me human or youll regret it Tairns mouth opens his tongue curling in a motion I know all too well I move between the two and tilt my chin at Tairn Hes just a little freaked out Dont scorch him At least we agree on something A feminine voice sounds through my head Sgaeyl In awe I blink up at the navyblue daggertail as Xaden moves to my side She talked to me I know I heard He folds his arms across his chest Its because theyre mates Its the same reason Im chained to you You make it sound so pleasant Its not He turns to face me But you and I are exactly that Violence Were chained Tethered You die I die so I damn well deserve to know how the hell you were under Seiferts knife one second and across the room in another Is that the signet power youve manifested with Tairn Come clean Now His eyes bore into me I dont know what happened I answer honestly Nature likes all things in balance Andarna says like shes reciting facts just like I do when Im nervous Thats the first thing were taught I pivot to face the golden dragon repeating what she said to Xaden What is that supposed to mean he asks me not her Guess that means he can hear Tairn but not Andarna Well not the first thing Andarna sits flicking her feathertail along the frostladen grass The first thing is we shouldnt bond until were fullgrown She cocks her head to the side Or maybe the first is where the sheep are I like goats better though This is why feathertails dont bond Tairn sighs with a hefty dose of exasperation Let her explain Sgaeyl urges clicking her talons like nails on the ground Feathertails shouldnt bond because they can accidentally gift their powers to humans Andarna continues Dragons cant channelnot reallyuntil were big but were all born with something special I relay the message Like a signet I ask out loud so Xaden can hear No Sgaeyl answers A signet is a combination of our power with your own ability to channel It reflects who you are at the core of your being Andarna sits up and tilts her head proudly But I gave my gift directly to you Because Im still a feathertail I repeat again staring at the smaller dragon Almost nothing is known about feathertails because theyre never seen outside the Vale Theyre guarded Theyre I swallow Wait What did she say Youre still a feathertail Yep For another couple of years probably She blinks slowly and then cracks a yawn her forked tail curling Oh Gods Youreyoure a hatchling I whisper I am not Andarna puffs steam into the air Im two The hatchlings cant even fly Shes a what Xadens gaze swings between Andarna and me I glare up at Tairn You let a juvenile bond A juvenile train for war We mature at a much faster rate than humans he argues having the nerve to look affronted And Im not sure anyone lets Andarna do anything How much faster I gasp Shes two years old Shell be fullgrown in a year or two but some are slower than others Sgaeyl answers And if I thought shed actually bond I would have objected harder to her Right of Benefaction She chuffs at Andarna in obvious disapproval Hold on Is Andarna yours Xaden walks a step toward Sgaeyl and the tone in his voice is one Ive never heard Heshurt Have you hidden a hatchling away from me these last two years Dont be ridiculous Sgaeyl blows out a blast of air that ruffles Xadens hair Do you think Id let my offspring bond while still feathered Her parents passed before hatching Tairn answers My heart sinks Oh Im sorry Andarna I have lots of elders she responds as though that makes up for it but having lost my dadI know it doesnt Not enough to keep you off the Threshing field Tairn grumbles Feathertails dont bond because their power is too unpredictable Unstable Unpredictable Xaden questions The same way you wouldnt hand a toddler your signet would you wingleader Tairn grunts when Andarna sags against his foreleg Gods no I could barely control it as a firstyear Xaden shakes his head Its odd to imagine Xaden ever not being in control Hell Id pay good money to see him lose it To be the one he lost it with Nope I shut that thought down immediately Exactly Bonding too young allows them to give their gift directly and a rider could easily drain them and burn out I would never I shake my head Thats why I chose you Andarnas head flops against Tairns leg How could I not see it before now Her rounded eyes her paws Of course you wouldnt know Feathertails arent supposed to be seen Tairn says glancing sideways at his mate She doesnt even roll her eyes If leadership knew riders could take her gifts for themselves rather than depending on their own signets Xaden says staring at Andarna as she blinks slower and slower Shed be hunted I finish quietly Which is why you cant tell anyone what she is Sgaeyl says Hopefully shell mature once youre out of the quadrant and the elders are already placing morestringent protections on the feathertails I wont I promise Andarna thank you Whatever you did saved my life I made time stop Her mouth drops open into another jawcracking yawn But only for a little bit Wait What My stomach hits the ground as I stare into Andarnas golden eyes and forget the pain the solid earth beneath my feet even the need to breathe as shock rolls through me robbing me of logic No one can stop time Nothing can stop it Itsunheard of What did she say Xaden asks gripping my shoulders to steady me Tairn growls and a puff of steam blasts us both Id take your hands off the rider Sgaeyl warns Xaden loosens his grip but continues to cradle my shoulders Tell me what she said Please His mouth tightens and I know that last bit cost him She can pause time I force out stumbling over my words Briefly Xadens features slacken and for the first time he doesnt look like the stalwart lethal wingleader I met on the parapet Hes flatout shocked as his gaze swings to Andarna You can stop time And now we can stop it She blinks slowly and I can feel exhaustion wafting off her Channeling that gift to me tonight cost her She can barely keep her eyes open In small increments I whisper In small increments Xaden echoes slowly like hes absorbing the information And if I use it too much I can kill you I say softly to Andarna Kill us She stands on all four paws But I know you wont Ill do my best to be worthy The ramifications of this gift this exceptional power hit me like a death blow and my stomach bottoms out Is Professor Carr going to kill me too Every gaze whips toward me and Xadens grip tightens on my shoulders his thumbs stroking in a soothing motion Why would you think that He killed Jeremiah I push the panic away and focus on the tiny golden flecks in Xadens onyx eyes You saw him snap his neck like a twig right in front of the whole quadrant Jeremiah was an inntinnsic Xadens voice lowers A mind reader is a capital offense You know that And what are they going to do if they find out I can stop time Terror freezes the blood in my veins Theyre not going to find out Xaden promises No one is going to tell them Not you Not me Not them He motions with one hand toward our trio of dragons Understand Hes right Tairn says They cant find out And theres no saying how long youll have the ability Most feathertail gifts disappear with maturity when they begin to channel Andarna cracks another yawn looking nearly dead on her feet Get some sleep I tell her Thank you for helping me tonight Lets go Golden One Tairn says and they all bend slightly then launch wind gusting against my face Andarna struggles her wings beating twice as hard and Tairn flies up underneath her taking her weight and continuing on to the Vale Promise me you wont tell anyone about the timestopping Xaden asks as we head back into the tunnel but it feels an awful lot like a command Its not just for your safety Rare abilities when kept secret are the most valuable form of currency we possess My brow furrows as I study the stark lines of the rebellion relic that winds up his neck marking him as a traitors son warning everyone that hes not to be trusted Maybe hes telling me to keep quiet for his own gain so he can use me later down the road At least that means he intends for me to be alive at a later date We need to figure out how unbonded cadets got in your room he says There was a rider there I tell him Someone who ran away before you arrived She must have unlocked it from the outside Who He halts taking my elbow gently and turning me toward him I shake my head Theres no way hell believe me I barely believe it myself At some point you and I are going to have to start trusting each other Sorrengail The rest of our lives depend on it Fury swims in Xadens eyes Now tell me who Accusing a wingleader of wrongdoing is the most dangerous of all accusations If youre right then weve failed as a quadrant to select the best wingleaders If youre wrong youre dead My Time as a Cadet A Memoir by General Augustine Melgren CHAPTER TWENTY Oren Seifert Captain Fitzgibbons finishes reading the death roll and closes the scroll as we stand in formation the next morning our breath creating clouds in the chilled air We commend their souls to Malek Theres no room for sorrow in my heart for six of the eight names not when Im shifting my weight to soothe the ache of blackandblue along my ribs and ignoring the way other riders stare at the ring of bruises I wear around my throat The two others on todays list are thirdyears from Second Wing killed on a training operation near the Braevick border according to breakfast gossip and I cant help but wonder if thats where Xaden had been before coming to my rescue last night I cant believe they tried to kill you while you were sleeping Rhiannons still seething at breakfast after I told our table what happened Maybe Xaden is fighting to keep last nights events a secret to hide what a liability I really am to him because no one else in leadership knows He didnt say a single word after I told him who unlocked the door so I have no clue if he believes me or not Even worse I think Im getting used to it Either I have kickass compartmentalization skills or I really am acclimating to always being a target Captain Fitzgibbons makes some minor announcements and I tune him out as someone strides our way cutting through the space between the Flame and Tail Sections of our wing Just like it always does my stupid hormonedriven heart stutters at the first sight of Xaden Even the most effective poisons come in pretty packages and Xadens exactly thatas beautiful as he is lethal He looks deceptively calm as he approaches but I can feel his tension as if its my own like a panther prowling toward his prey The wind ruffles his hair and I sigh at the completely unfair advantage he has over every man in this courtyard He doesnt even have to try to look sexyhe just is Oh shit This feeling right herethe way my breath catches and my entire body draws tight when hes nearis why I havent taken anyone to bed or celebrated like the rest of my perfectly normal friends This feeling is why I havent wanted anyoneelse Because I want him There arent enough curse words in the world for this His gaze locks with mine just long enough to quicken my pulse before he addresses Dain ignoring Fitzgibbonss announcements behind him Theres a change to your squad roll Wingleader Dain questions his spine straightening We just absorbed four from the dissolution of the third squad Yes Xaden looks to the right where Second Squad Tail Section stands at attention Belden were making a roll change Yes sir The squad leader nods once Aetos Vaughn Penley will be leaving your command and youll be gaining Liam Mairi from Tail Section Dains mouth snaps shut and he nods We all watch as the two firstyear riders exchange places Penleys only been with us since Threshing so theres no heartfelt goodbye from our original squad but the other three grumble Liam nods at Xaden and my stomach twists I know exactly why hes being put under Dains command The guy is massive as tall as Sawyer and as built as Dain with lightblond hair prominent nose blue eyes and the sprawling rebellion relic that begins at his wrist and disappears under the sleeve of his tunic gives his mission away I do not need a bodyguard I snap at Xaden Am I out of line speaking to a wingleader that way Absolutely Do I care Not one bit He ignores me facing Dain Liam is statistically the strongest firstyear in the quadrant He has the fastest time up the Gauntlet hasnt lost a single challenge and is bonded to an exceptionally strong Red Daggertail Any squad would be lucky to have him and hes all yours Aetos You can thank me when you win the Squad Battle in the spring Liam steps into formation behind me taking Penleys place I Do Not Need A Bodyguard I repeat a little louder this time I could give two fucks who hears me One of the firstyears behind me gasps mortified by my audacity no doubt Imogen snorts Good luck with that approach Xaden walks past Dain and stands directly in front of me leaning into my space You do though as we both learned last night And I cant be everywhere you are But Liam herehe points back to the blond Tyrhes a firstyear so he can be in every class at every challenge and I even had him assigned to library duty so I hope you get used to him Sorrengail Youre overstepping My nails bite into my palms You havent begun to see overstepping he warns his voice dropping low sending a shiver down my spine Any threat against you is a threat against me and as weve already established I have more important things to do than sleep on your floor Heat flushes up my neck and stains my cheeks He is not sleeping in my room Of course not He freaking smirks and my traitorous stomach dips I had him moved into the one next to yours Wouldnt want to overstep He turns on his heel and walks away headed back to his place at the front of our formation Fucking mated dragons Dain seethes keeping his eyes forward Fitzgibbons finishes his announcements and steps to the back of the dais which would usually signal the end of formation but Commandant Panchek takes the podium He makes it a habit to avoid morning formation which means something is up Whats going on with Panchek Rhiannon asks at my side Not sure I take a deep breath wincing at the pain in my ribs It has to be something big if hes fumbling with a Codex up there Rhiannon says Quiet Dain orders glancing back over his shoulder at us for the first time this morning He does a doubletake his eyes flaring wide as he catches sight of my neck Vi He hasnt spoken to me since our fight yesterday Gods how has it been less than twentyfour hours when I feel like a completely different person Im fine I assure him but hes still staring at my throat locked in shock Squad Leader Aetos people are staring We hold way more than our share of the attention as Commandant Panchek begins to speak at the podium telling us that theres another matter to handle this morning but Dain wont look away Dain He blinks jerking his gaze to mine and the apology in those soft brown eyes clogs my throat Is that what Riorson meant by last night I nod I didnt know Why didnt you tell me Because you wouldnt believe me even if I did Im fine I repeat nodding toward the dais Later He turns but the motion is reluctant It has been brought to my attention as your commandant that a breach of the Codex has occurred Panchek calls out over the courtyard As you know breaches of our most sacred laws are not to be tolerated Panchek continues This matter will be addressed here and now Will the accuser please step forward Someones in trouble Rhiannon whispers Think Ridoc finally got caught in Tyvon Varens bed Thats hardly against the Codex Ridoc murmurs from behind us Hes the executive officer for Second Wing I send a pointed look over my shoulder And Ridoc shrugs grinning without a touch of remorse Fraternizing with command is frowned upon not unlawful I sigh facing forward I miss sex I really do and its not just the physical gratification either Theres a sense of connection in those moments that I crave a momentary banishment of loneliness The first is something Im sure Xaden would be more than capable of providing if he ever thought of me that way but the second Hes the last person I should be craving but lust and logic never seem to go hand in hand If youre looking for a little fun Im happy to oblige Ridoc starts shoving his floppy brown hair off his forehead with a wink I miss good sex I counter smothering a smile as someone walks from the front of formation toward the dais indistinguishable through the rows of the squads ahead of us Besides apparently youre spoken for Have to admit it feels good to tease a friend about something so trivial Its a tiny slice of normalcy in an otherwise macabre environment Were not exclusive Ridoc counters Its like Rhiannon and whatshername Tara Rhiannon offers Will you all shut the hell up Dain barks in his superiorofficer voice Our mouths snap shut Mine drops open again when I realize its Xaden climbing the steps to the dais My stomach lurches as I suck in a tight breath This is about me I whisper Dain glances back at me confusion furrowing his brow before whipping his attention toward the dais where Xaden now stands at the podium somehow managing to fill the entire stage with his presence From what I remember reading his father had that same magnetism the ability to hold and capture a crowd with nothing but his wordswords that led to Brennans death Early this morning he begins his deep voice carrying over the formation a rider in my wing was brutally illegally attacked in her sleep with the intent of murder by a group primarily composed of unbondeds A collection of murmurs and gasps fills the air and Dains shoulders stiffen As we all know this is a violation of Article Three Section Two of the Dragon Riders Codex and in addition to being dishonorable is a capital offense I feel the weight of a dozen glances but its Xadens I feel most of all His hands clench the sides of the podium Having been alerted by my dragon I interrupted the attack along with two other Fourth Wing riders He dips his chin toward our wing and two ridersGarrick and Bodhibreak formation then climb the steps to stand behind Xaden their hands at their sides As it was a matter of life and death I personally executed six of the wouldbe murderers as witnessed by Flame Section Leader Garrick Tavis and Tail Section Executive Officer Bodhi Durran Both Tyrs How convenient Nadine one of our new additions to the squad says from the row behind Ridoc and Liam I look back over my shoulder and pin her with a glare Liam keeps his eyes forward But the attack was orchestrated by a rider who fled before I arrived Xaden continues his voice rising A rider who had access to the map of where all firstyears are assigned to sleep and that rider must be brought to swift justice Shit This is about to get ugly I call you to answer for your crime against Cadet Sorrengail Xadens focus shifts to the center of the formation Wingleader Amber Mavis The quadrant draws a collective breath before an uproar rips through the crowd What the hell Dain bites out My chest tightens Gods I hate it when Dain proves me right Rhiannon reaches for my hand squeezing tight in support as every rider in the courtyards attention pivots between Xaden Amberand me Shes a Tyr too Nadine Ridoc says over his shoulder Or are you only biased against marked ones Ambers family stayed loyal to Navarre so she wasnt forced to watch her parents executed and wasnt marked by a rebellion relic Amber would never Dain shakes his head A wingleader would never He turns completely to face me Get up there and tell everyone that hes lying Vi But hes not I say as gently as I can Its impossible His cheeks flush a mottled shade of red I was there Dain The reality of his disbelief hurts so much more than I expected like a blow to my already battered ribs Wingleaders are beyond reproach Then why are you so quick to call our own wingleader a liar My brows rise in challenge daring him to say what hes so careful to keep quiet Behind him Amber steps forward separating herself from the formation I have committed no such crime See Dain swings his arm pointing toward the redhead Put a stop to this right now Violet She was with them in my room I say simply Shouting wont convince him Nothing will Thats impossible He lifts his hands as though ready to cup my face Let me see The shock of what he intends to do has me stumbling backward How have I forgotten that his signet allows him to see others memories But if I let him see my memory of Ambers participation it will also show him that I stopped time and I cant let that happen I shake my head and take another step back Give me the memory he orders Indignation lifts my chin Touch me without permission and youll spend the rest of your life regretting it Surprise ripples over his features Wingleaders Xaden projects his voice over the chaos We need a quorum Both Nyra and Septon Izarthe wingleaders for First and Second Wingclimb the stairs to the dais passing by Amber as she stands utterly exposed in the courtyard A familiar chaos fills the air and we all look toward the ridgeline as six dragons curve along the mountain flying straight for us The biggest among them is Tairn In a matter of seconds they reach the citadel and hover over the courtyard walls Wind from the strong beats of their wings blasts through the courtyard Then one by one they land on their perch Tairn at the center of the grouping Every line of his frame exudes menace as his talons crush the masonry under his grip and his narrowed angry eyes focus on Amber Sgaeyl is perched to the right taking her position behind Xaden Shes just as terrifying as she was that first day but back then Id never imagined Id bond a dragon even more frighteningto everyone but me Nyras Red Scorpiontail looms behind her as well and Septons Brown Daggertail mirrors the stance to the left On the ends puffing blasts of steam are Commandant Pancheks Green Clubtail and Ambers Orange Daggertail Shits about to get real Sawyer says breaking formation to stand at my side and I feel Ridoc at my back You can stop this all right now Violet You have to Dain implores I dont know what you saw last night but it wasnt Amber She cares too much about the rules to break them And she thinks I broke them by using my dagger on the last ascent of the Gauntlet Youre using this to get your revenge on my family Amber shouts at Xaden For not supporting your fathers rebellion Thats a low fucking blow Xaden doesnt even acknowledge it as he turns to the other wingleaders He isnt demanding proof like Dain He believes me and hes ready to execute a wingleader on nothing more than my word As surely as if theyre a physical structure I feel my defenses crack on Xadens behalf Can you see my memories I ask Tairn Share them Yes His head snakes left and right ever so slightly A memory has never been shared outside of a mating bond Its considered a violation Xadens up there fighting because I told him it was her Help him And gods I admire him for it I take a deep breath Only what they need to see Wanting and admiring Im so screwed Tairn chuffs and every dragon besides Sgaeyl stiffens on the wall even Ambers The riders are quick to follow silence filling the courtyard and I know they know That spineless wretch Rhiannon seethes her hand squeezing mine even tighter Dain pales Believe me now I hurl it like the accusation it is Youre supposed to be my oldest friend Dain My best friend Theres a reason I didnt tell you He staggers backward The wingleaders have formed a quorum and are in unanimous agreement Xaden announces flanked by Nyra and Septon while the commandant hangs back We find you guilty Amber Mavis No she shouts It is no crime to rid the quadrant of the weakest rider I did it to protect the integrity of the wings She paces in panic looking to everyoneanyone for help As a whole the formation moves backward And as is our law your sentence will be carried out by fire Nyra states No Amber looks to her dragon Claidh Ambers Orange Daggertail snarls at the other dragons and lifts a claw Tairn swivels his massive head toward Claidh his roar shaking the ground beneath my feet Then he snaps his teeth at the smaller orange and she retreats her head hanging as she grips the wall again The sight breaks my heart not for Amber but for Claidh Do you have to I ask Tairn This is our way Please dont I beg forgetting to think the words Its one thing to punish Amber but Claidh will suffer as well Maybe I could talk to Amber Maybe we can still work through our issues Maybe we can find common ground turn our anger to friendship or at least casual indifference I shake my head my heart pounding in my throat I did this I was so focused on whether anyone would believe me I didnt stop to think what might happen if they did I turn to Xaden and beg again my voice breaking by the end Please give her a chance He holds my gaze but doesnt so much as show a flicker of emotion I let someone live once and he almost killed you last night Silver One Tairn says Then as if this is all that really matters in the end Justice is not always merciful Claidh Amber whimpers the courtyard so unbelievably silent that the sound carries The formation splits at the center Tairn leans low extending his head and neck past the dais toward where Amber stands Then his teeth part he curls his tongue and he incinerates her with a blast of fire so hot I can feel it from here Its over in a heartbeat A gruesome scream rends the air shattering a window in the academic wing and every rider slams their hands over their ears as Claidh mourns Dont freak out if you cant immediately channel your dragons powers Mira Yeah I know you have to be the best at everything but this isnt something you can control Theyll channel when they feel youre ready And once they do youd better be ready to manifest a signet Until then youre not ready Dont push it Page sixtyone the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TWENTYONE This really isnt necessary I glance sideways at Liam as we make our way toward the door of the Archives The cart doesnt even squeak anymore He fixed that the very first day So youve told me for the last week He shoots me a grin revealing a dimple And yet youre still here Every day All day Its not that I dont like him To my absolute annoyance hes actuallynice Courteous funny and ridiculously helpful He makes it difficult to loathe his constant presence even though he leaves wood shavings in little piles everywhere he goeswhich is everywhere I go now The guy is constantly whittling with that smaller knife of his Yesterday he finished the figurine of a bear Until otherwise ordered he says I shake my head at him as Pierson jolts upright at the Archives doors straightening his cream tunic Good morning Cadet Pierson You as well Cadet Sorrengail He offers me a polite smile which dies as he glances at Liam Cadet Mairi Cadet Pierson Liam responds as if the scribes tone hadnt completely changed My shoulders tense as Pierson hurries to open the door Maybe its just that I havent been around marked ones before Basgiath but the outright hostility toward them is becoming glaringly uncomfortably obvious to me We walk into the Archives and wait by the table just like every other morning How do you do that I ask Liam in a hushed whisper Handle when people are that rude without reacting Youre rude to me all the time he teases drumming his fingers on the handle of the cart Because youre my babysitter not because I cant even say it Because Im the son of the disgraced Colonel Mairi His jaw ticks his brow furrowing for a heartbeat as he looks away I nod my stomach sinking as I think back over the last few months I guess Im really no better though I hated Xaden on sight and I didnt know a single thing about him Not that I do now either Hes infuriatingly good at being completely inaccessible Liam scoffs earning us a glare from a scribe near the back corner He has that effect on people especially women They either despise him for what his father did or want to fuck him for the same reason just depends on where we are You actually know him dont you I crane my neck to look up at him He didnt just pick you to shadow me because youre the best in our year Just now catching on huh A grin flashes across his face I would have told you that on the first day if you hadnt been so busy huffing and puffing about the pleasure of my company I roll my eyes as Jesinia approaches her hood up over her hair Hey Jesinia I sign Good morning she signs back her mouth curving in a shy smile as her gaze darts up to Liam Good morning He signs with a wink clearly flirting It shocked me to my toes that first day that he knew how to sign but honestly Id been a little judgy just because I didnt want a shadow Just these today Jesinia asks inspecting the cart And these I reach for the list of requests amid their obvious glances and hand it to her Perfect Her cheeks flush and she studies the list before putting it in her pocket Oh and Professor Markham left before his daily report arrived to teach your briefing Would you mind taking it over Happy to I wait until shes pushing the cart away from us then smack Liams chest Stop it I whisper out loud Stop what He watches her until she turns the corner at the first set of shelves Flirting with Jesinia Shes a longtermrelationship woman so unless thats what youre looking forjustdont His eyebrows hit his hairline How does anyone think longterm around here Not everyone is in a quadrant where death is less of a chance and more of a foregone conclusion I breathe in the scent of the Archives and try to absorb a little of the peace it brings So youre saying that some people still try to make cute little things like plans Exactly and those some people is Jesinia Trust me Ive known her for years Right Because you wanted to be a scribe when you grew up He scans the Archives with an intensity that almost makes me laugh As if theres any chance someone is going to lunge out of the shelves and come after me How did you know that I lower my voice as a group of secondyears passes their expressions somber as they debate the merits of two different historians I did my research on you after I wasyou knowassigned He shakes his head Ive seen you practicing this week with those blades of yours Sorrengail Riorson was right You would have been wasted as a scribe My chest swells with more than a little pride That remains to be seen At least challenges havent resumed Guess enough of us are dying during flight lessons to hold off on killing more through handtohand What did you want to be when you grew up I ask just to keep the conversation going Alive He shrugs Well thatssomething How do you know Xaden anyway Im not foolish enough to think that everyone in the province of Tyrrendor knows one another Riorson and I were fostered at the same estate after the apostasy he says using the Tyrrish term for the rebellion which I havent heard in ages You were fostered My mouth drops open Fostering the children of aristocrats was a custom that died out after the unification of Navarre more than six hundred years ago Well yeah He shrugs again Where did you think the kids of the traitorshe flinches at the wordwent after they executed our parents I look out over the sprawling shelves of texts wondering if one of them holds the answer I didnt think My throat catches on that last word Most of our great houses were given to nobles who had remained loyal He clears his throat As it should be I dont bother agreeing with whats obviously a conditioned reply King Tauris response after the rebellion was swift even cruel but I was a fifteenyearold girl too lost in her own grief to think mercifully on the people whod caused my brothers death The burning of Aretia which had been Tyrrendors capital to the ground had never sat well with me though Liam was the same age It wasnt his fault his mother had broken faith with Navarre But you didnt go with your father to his new home His gaze swings toward mine and his brow furrows Its hard to live with a man who was executed on the same day as my mother My stomach sinks No No thats not right Your father was Isaac Mairi right Ive studied all the noble houses in every province including Tyrrendor Had I gotten something wrong Yes Isaac was my father He tilts his head looking toward the area where Jesinia disappeared and I get the distinct feeling he is over this conversation But he wasnt a part of the rebellion I shake my head trying to make sense of it He isnt on the death roll of the executions from Calldyr You read the death roll from the Calldyr executions His eyes flare It takes all my courage but I hold his stare I needed to see that someone was on it He draws back slightly Fen Riorson I nod He killed my brother at the Battle of Aretia My mind scrambles trying to harmonize what Ive read and what hes saying But your father wasnt on that roll But Liam wasas a witness Mortification sweeps over me What the hell am I doing Im so sorry I shouldnt have asked He was executed at our familys house His features tighten Before it was given to another noble of course And yes I watched as they did it that time too I already had the rebellion relic by then but the pain was the same He looks away his throat working Then I was sent to Tirvainne to be fostered by Duke Lindell the same as Riorson My little sister was sent elsewhere They separated you My jaw practically unhinges Neither fostering nor separating siblings is mentioned in any text Ive read about the rebellion and Ive read a ton He nods Shes only a year younger than me though so Ill get to see her when she enters the quadrant next year Shes strong quick and has good balance Shell make it The edge of panic in his tone reminds me of Mira She could always choose another quadrant I say softly hoping it will soothe him He blinks at me Were all riders What Were all riders It was part of the deal Were allowed to live allowed a chance to prove our loyalty but only if we make it through the Riders Quadrant He stares at me in bewilderment You dont know I mean I shake my head I know that the children of the leaders the officers were all forced into conscription but thats all A lot of those treaty addenda are classified I personally think the quadrant was chosen to give us the best chance of rising in rank but others He grimaces Others think its because the death rate is so much higher for riders so they were hoping to kill us all off without having to do it themselves Ive heard Imogen say they originally figured the dragons have unimpeachable honor so theyd never bond a marked one in the first place and now they dont quite know what to do with us How many of you are there I think of my mother and cant help but wonder how much of it she knows how much of it she agreed to when she became the commanding general of Basgiath after Brennans death Xadens never He pauses Sixtyeight of the officers had kids under the age of twenty There are one hundred and seven of us all who carry rebellion relics The oldest is Xaden I murmur He nods And the youngest is almost six now Her name is Julianne I think Im going to be sick Is she marked She was born with it I understand it was done by dragon but what the fucking hell And its all right that you ask Someone should know Someone should remember His shoulders rise and fall as he breathes deeply Anyway is it hard for you to be in here Or is it more of a comfort thing Subject change noted I take in the rows of tables slowly filling with scribes readying themselves for work and imagine my father among them Its like coming home but not And its not that its changedthis place never changes Hell I think change is the mortal enemy of a scribe But Im starting to realize that Ive changed I dont quite fit here Not anymore Yeah I get that Something in his voice tells me he really does Its on the tip of my tongue to ask what the last five years were like for him but Jesinia reappears the cart laden with the requested tomes I have everything here for you she signs then gestures to the scroll on top And that is for Professor Markham Well make sure he gets it I promise leaning forward to take the cart My high collar shifts and Jesinia gasps her hand flying to cover her mouth Oh gods Violet Your neck Her hand movements are sharp and the sympathy in her eyes makes my chest tighten Sympathy isnt a word found in our quadrant Theres rage wrath and indignationbut no sympathy Its nothing I put my collar back in place covering the ring of yellowing bruises and Liam reaches across me taking the cart Well see you tomorrow She bobs her head and wrings her hands as we turn for the door Pierson closes it after we pass into the hallway Riorson taught me to fight during the years he was at Tirvainne Liams change of subject is appreciated and no doubt intentional once again Ive never seen anyone move the way he does Hes the only reason I made it through the first round of challenges He might not show it but he takes care of his own Are you trying to sell me on his finer points We make the ascent and I note with some satisfaction that my legs feel strong today I love the days when my body cooperates You are slightly stuck with him for He makes a face Well forever Or until one of us dies I joke but it falls flat as we round the corner and take the path past the Healer Quadrant How can you do this anyway Guard someone whose own mother oversaw the wing that captured yours Ive wanted to ask the question all week Wondering if you can trust me He flashes another easy grin Yes The answer is simple He laughs the sound echoing off the tunnel walls and glass windows of the clinic Good answer All I can say is that your survival is essential to Riorsons and I owe him everything Everything He looks me straight in the eye for that last word even as the cart hits a raised stone in the paved corridor The scroll on top tumbles to the floor and I wince at the dull ache in my ribs as I hurry to retrieve it and it unrolls along the slight slope of the passage Got it The thick parchment isnt eager to roll back into place and I catch a sentence that makes me pause The conditions at Sumerton are of particular concern A village was ransacked and a supply convoy looted last night What does it say Liam asks Sumerton was attacked I flip the scroll to see if its marked as classified but it isnt On the southern border He looks as confused as I feel Yeah I nod Its another highaltitude attack too if I remember my geography correctly It says a supply convoy was looted I read a little further And the community storage in nearby caves was ransacked But that doesnt make sense We have a trade agreement with Poromiel A raiding party then I shrug No clue Guess well hear about it in Battle Brief today Attacks along our southern borders are rising all with the same description Mountain villages are being torn apart wherever the wards weaken Immense incredible hunger strikes my stomach gnawing on emptiness that demands to be appeased with the blood of Sorrengail Liam looks over at me concern etched between his brows Tairns awake I manage to say clutching my stomach like Im the one who craves a flock of sheep Or goats Or whatever he decides for the morning Good gods please go eat something The same could be suggested to you he snarls Such a morning person arent you The hunger dissipates and I know its because hes dampening the bond in that moment because I cant His emotions only flow into me when they override his control Thank you Andarna Still sleeping Shell be out another few days after using that much power Does it ever get any easier I ask Liam Being tackled by what theyre feeling He winces Good question Deigh keeps pretty good control of himself but when hes angry Liam shakes his head Its supposed to help once they start channeling and we have the power to shield them out but you know Carr isnt going to bother with us until that happens Id already assumed Liam didnt have his abilities yet considering hes with me in every single class but its comforting to know hes still in the waning population of powerless riders with me While Andarna has given me her gift for stopping time Im pretty sure using it isnt going to be a regular occurrence especially if it takes her days to recover So Tairn hasnt channeled to you either right Liam asks a look of uncertainty vulnerability on his face I shake my head I think he has commitment issues I whisper I heard that Then stay out of my head Another wave of paralyzing hunger assaults me and I nearly crush Markhams scroll in my hand Dont be an ass I swear I hear him chuff a chuckle in response Wed better hurry or well miss breakfast Right I finish rolling the scroll and put it back on the cart I want to be like the cool kids Rhiannon grumbles as firstyears from Second and Third Wings pour out of the stairwell of the turret that leads up to Professor Carrs classroom that afternoon further clogging the hallway on our way to Battle Brief We will I promise linking my arm through hers Have to admit theres more than a little twinge of jealousy in my chest You may be cool but you will never be as cool as I am Ridoc pushes past Liam and throws his arm over my shoulder Shes talking about everyone whos already channeling I explain juggling my books so I dont drop them Though at least if were not channeling were not stressed about manifesting a signet before the magic kills us The relic in the center of my back tingles and I cant help but wonder if Andarnas gift has triggered that clock for me Oh I thought we were discussing how I just owned that physics test He grins Definitely the highest score in the class Rhiannon rolls her eyes Please I scored five points higher than you We stopped counting your grades months ago He leans forward slightly Your grades in that class make it unfair for the rest of us He looks between our shoulders Wait What did you get Mairi Not getting into the middle of this Liam responds I laugh as we break apart entering the bottleneck of cadets to get into the briefing room Sorry Sorrengail someone says stepping out of the way and tugging their friend with them as we enter the tiered classroom Nothing to be sorry about I call out but theyre already headed up a few rows Im never going to get used to that It definitely makes getting places easier Rhiannon teases as we descend the steps that curve along the massive turret They show the appropriate level of deference Tairn grumbles To what they think Ill be not who I am We find our row and walk to our seats sitting as a squad among the firstyears That shows excellent forethought The room buzzes with energy as riders file in and I cant help but notice that no one has to stand anymore Our numbers have decreased exponentially in the last four months The number of empty chairs is sobering We lost another firstyear yesterday when he got too close to another riders Red Scorpiontail on the flight field One second he was standing there and the next he was a scorched patch of earth I kept as close to Tairn as possible the rest of the session My scalp prickles but I fight the urge to turn around Riorson just got here Liam says from the seat to my right breaking from the little dragon figurine hes carving and looking up the rows toward the thirdyears Figured I hold up my middle finger and keep my eyes forward Not that I dont like Liam but Im still pissed at Xaden for assigning him Liam snorts and grins flashing his dimple And now hes glaring Tell me is it fun pissing off the most powerful rider in the quadrant You could try it yourself and find out I suggest opening my notebook to the next empty page I cant turn around I wont Wanting Xaden is fine It has to be Indulging the impulses it gives me Thats asinine Thats going to be a no from me I lose the battle with my selfcontrol and look over my shoulder Sure enough Xaden is seated in the top row next to Garrick mastering the art of looking bored He gives Liam a nod which Liam returns I roll my eyes and face forward again Liam concentrates on his carving which looks a lot like his Red Daggertail Deigh I swear youd think there were assassination attempts on me during every class with the way he makes you shadow me I shake my head In his defense people are fond of trying to kill you Rhiannon sets out her supplies One time Its happened one time Rhi I adjust my posture to keep my weight off my bruised ribs Theyre wrapped tight but leaning against the back of my seat isnt an option Right And what would you call that whole thing with Tynan Rhiannon asks Threshing I shrug And Barlowes constant threats She arches a brow at me She has a point there Sawyer chimes in leaning forward from the seat next to Rhiannons Theyre just threats The only time Ive actually been targeted was at night and its not like Liam here is sleeping in my bedroom I mean Im not opposed he begins his knife hovering over the piece of wood Dont even start I whip my head to face him and cant help but laugh You are a shameless flirt Thank you He grins and goes back to carving It wasnt a compliment Dont mind her shes just sexually frustrated Makes a girl crabby Rhiannon writes the date down on her empty page and I follow suit dipping my quill into my portable inkpot Those easy messless pens some of the others can already use is just another reason I cant wait to channel No more quills No more inkpots That has nothing to do with it Gods could she have said that a little louder And yet I dont hear you denying it She smiles sweetly at me Im sorry I dont make the cut Liam teases But Im sure Riorson would be fine with my reviewing a couple candidates especially if it means youll stop flipping him off in front of his entire wing And how exactly would you be reviewing candidates What will you be scoring Rhiannon asks one eyebrow raised above her wide grin This I have to hear I manage a straight face for all of two seconds before laughing at how horrified he suddenly looks Thanks for the offer though Ill make sure to run any potential liaisons by you I mean you could watch Rhiannon continues blinking innocently at him Just to be sure shes fully covered You know so no onesticks it to her Oh are we telling dick jokes now Ridoc asks from Liams side Because my entire life has led up to this very moment Even Sawyer laughs Fuck me Liam mutters under his breath Im just saying that since youre protected at night now We laugh harder and he blows out a deep breath Wait I stop laughing What do you mean Im protected at night Because youre next door My smile vanishes Please tell me hes not making you sleep in the hallway or something obnoxious No Of course not He warded your door the morning after the attack His expression clearly says I should know this Im guessing he didnt tell you He what He warded your door Liam says quieter this time So only you can open it Shit I dont know how to feel about that Its more than slightly controlling and way out of line but alsosweet But if hes the one who warded it then he can get in too right Well yeah Liam shrugs as Professors Markham and Devera walk down the stairs heading for the front of the room But its not like Riorson is going to kill you Right You see Im still adjusting to that little change of heart I fumble my quill and it falls to the ground but before I can lean over the shadows beneath the arm of my desk lift the instrument like an offering I pluck it out of the shadows and look back at Xaden Hes locked in conversation with Garrick not paying me a speck of attention Except apparently he is If we can get started Markham calls over the room and we fall silent as he places the scroll Liam and I had delivered to him before breakfast on the podium Excellent I write Sumerton down at the top of the page and Liam trades his knife for a quill First announcement Devera says stepping forward Weve decided that not only will the winners of this years Squad Battle receive bragging rights She grins like were in for a treat But theyll also be given a trip to the front lines to shadow an active wing Cheers break out all around us So if we win we get a chance to die sooner Rhiannon whispers Maybe theyre trying a reverse psychology thing I glance at the others around us who are clearly overjoyed and worry about their sanity Then again most everyone in this room can stay on their dragon So can you Dont you have better things to do with your day than listen in on my selfloathing Not particularly Now pay attention Stop butting in and maybe I can I counter Tairn chuffs One day I might be able to translate that sound but its not today I know the Squad Battle doesnt commence until spring Devera continues but I figured that news would give you all the proper motivation to apply yourselves in every area leading up to the challenges Another cheer resounds And now that we have your attention Markham lifts his hand and the room quiets The front lines are relatively quiet today so were going to take this opportunity to dissect the Battle of Gianfar My quill hovers above my notebook Surely he didnt say that The mage lights rise to the Cliffs of Dralor that separate Tyrrendor lifting the entire province thousands of feet above the rest of the Continent before shining brightest on the ancient stronghold along the southern border This battle was pivotal to the unification of Navarre and though it happened more than six centuries ago there are important lessons that still impact our flight formations to this day Is he serious I whisper to Liam Yeah Liams grip bends his quill I think he is What made this battle unique Devera asks her eyebrows raised Bryant The stronghold was not only set for a siege the secondyear says from high above us but was equipped with the first crossbolt which proved lethal against dragonkind Yes And Devera prompts It was one of the final battles where gryphons and dragons actually worked alongside each other to annihilate the army of the Barrens the secondyear continues I glance left and right watching the other riders begin to take notes Surreal This is justsurreal Even Rhiannon is writing intensely None of them knows what we do that an entire village of Navarrians was ransacked last night along the border and supplies looted And yet were discussing a battle that happened before the convenience of indoor plumbing was invented Now pay close attention Markham lectures Because youll be turning in a detailed report in three days and drawing comparisons to battles from the last twenty years Was that scroll marked classified Liam asks under his breath No I respond just as quietly But maybe I missed it The battle map doesnt even show activity near that mountain range Yeah He nods scratching his quill against the parchment as he begins to take notes That has to be it You missed it I blink forcing my hand through the motions of writing about a battle Ive analyzed dozens of times with my father Liams right Thats the only possible explanation Our clearance isnt high enough or maybe they havent finished gathering all the information needed to form an accurate report Or it had to have been marked classified I just missed it The first rush of power is unmistakable The first time it forms to you surrounds you with a seemingly endless supply of energy youll be addicted to the high to the possibilities of all you can do with it to the control you hold in the palm of your hand But heres the thing that power can quickly turn and control you Page sixtyfour the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TWENTYTWO The rest of November passes without mention of what happened at Sumerton and by the time the howling winds bring snow in December Ive given up hoping command will release the information Its not like Liam or I can directly ask the professors without incriminating ourselves for reading what was obviously a classified reporteven if it wasnt marked It makes me wonder what else doesnt make it to Battle Brief but I keep that to myself Between that and my growing frustration over my inability to channelunlike threequarters of my yearIm keeping a lot to myself these days Not entirely Tairn grunts No comments from you not after you almost let me hit the side of a mountain today My stomach churns just thinking about how far he let me fall The firstyear from Third Wing wasnt as lucky She lost her seat during a new maneuver and ended up on the death roll this morning Rhiannon swings her bow staff and I throw my weight into a backbend narrowly escaping the strike To my absolute surprise I keep my balance on the training mat Then stay on next time Start channeling and maybe Ill be able to I counter Youre distracted tonight Rhiannon backs off as I regain my balance showing me mercy no opponent would during a challenge Her gaze flicks across the mat to where Liam sits on a bench carving yet another dragon and returns to mine giving me a look that says shell follow up later once Ive been released from my constant shadow for the night But youre faster than you used to be Whatever Imogen has you doing is working Youre not ready to channel yet Silver One As if there was ever any doubt Imogen calls from the next mat over where she casually holds Ridoc in a headlock waiting for him to tap out To my left Sawyer and Quinn circle each other preparing for yet another round and behind Rhiannon Emery and Heaton are doing their best to coach the other firstyears we gained after Threshing while Dain looks on studiously avoiding anything that has to do with me Per his recent orders Tuesday nights are for squad handtohand practice because the full academic load were carrying coupled with flight lessons and now wielding instruction for some of us isnt leaving much time for the mat A few of the farther mats are taken up by other riders with the same idea one of which includes Jack Barlowe Hence why Liam refused when Ridoc asked to spar with him Youre taking it easy on me I tell Rhiannon Sweat drips down my back dampening the tightfitted tunic I chose while my dragonscale vest dries on the bench next to Liam Its not like he needs extra practice Hes already taken everyone but Dain down to the mat and part of me thinks thats only because Dain refuses to be bested by a younger rider Weve been at this for an hour Rhiannon swishes her staff through the air Youre tired and the last thing I want is to hurt you Challenges resume after solstice I remind her Youre not doing me any favors by holding back Shes not wrong a deep voice says from behind me In my peripherals I see Liam stand and I mutter a curse under my breath Well aware I say over my shoulder as Xaden passes by our mat accompanied by Garrick as usual Its impossible to rip my eyes away until he passes though Gods I have it bad Go away unless you have something useful to say Move faster Youll be less likely to die Hows that for useful he calls back taking up a position on a mat closer to the center of the sparring gym Rhiannons eyes flare and Liam shakes his head What The way you talk to him Rhiannon murmurs Whats he going to do Kill me I charge forward swinging my staff at her legs She jumps over the attack and spins bringing the staff against mine with a crack Youre likely to kill each other Liam chimes in taking his seat again Cant wait to see how you two function after graduation After graduation Havent let myself think past this week let alone all the way to graduation Not when there are some very difficult questions Im not ready to ask Look I know youreaggravated by how long its taking Tairn to channel Rhiannon says circling me on the mat again Im just saying on this mat with me is a way safer place for you to take out that anger than the giant shadowwielding wingleader I dont want to take any of my anger out on you Youre my friend I gesture loosely toward Xaden Hes the one who stuck me with a shadow I cant shake because he thinks Im his weakness But does he help me I lash out with the staff and she counters No Does he train me Another lunge another clash of our staffs No Hes remarkably good at showing up when Im about to die and eliminating threats but thats it He sure as hell doesnt have a problem keeping his eyes off me the way I do him So theres definitely some anger there Rhiannon drawls as she spins away easily You would be furious if someone took your freedom away If you had Liam at your door every morning until every night even as seemingly great as he is I dodge one of her attacks I appreciate that Liam butts in proving my point Yeah she agrees I would And Im pissed on your behalf Now lets put that anger to use Rhiannon rains another series of moves down on me and I keep up but only because shes doing exactly what I accused her of and taking it easy on me Then I make the mistake of glancing over her shoulder toward the center of the gym Holy Fucking Hot Xaden and Garrick have stripped off their shirts and are sparring like their lives depend on it a blur of kicks punches and rippling muscle Ive never seen two people move that fast Its a beautiful hypnotizing dance with lethal choreography that makes me hold my breath whenever Garrick goes in for the kill and Xaden deflects Ive seen countless riders spar without their shirts these past months This is nothing new I should be absolutely immune to the male form but Ive never seen him shirtless Every edge of Xadens body is honed like a weapon all sharp lines and barely leashed power His rebellion relic twists around his upper body and stands out against the deep bronze of his skin accentuating every punch he throws and his stomach I mean how many muscles are there in the abdominals His are so rigidly defined that I could probably count every single one if the rest of him wasnt so damned distracting And he has the largest dragon relic Ive ever seen Mine consumes the skin between shoulder blades but Sgaeyls mark takes up his entire back And I know exactly how that body feels on top of mine just how much power My hip stings knocking me out of my trance and I startle Serves you right Tairn lectures Pay attention Rhiannon yells drawing back her staff I could have Oh Clearly she sees what I do what nearly every other womanand several of the menare happily watching How can we not when the two of them are mesmerizing Garricks wider more densely packed with muscle than Xaden his rebellion relic only extending to his shoulder the second largest Ive seen Only Xadens reaches his carved jawline That is Rhiannon murmurs beside me It sure is I agree Stop objectifying our wingleader Liam teases Is that what were doing Rhiannon asks not bothering to look away My mouth waters at the muscled expanse of his back and that sculpted ass Yeah I think thats what were doing Liam snorts We could just be watching for technique Yeah We absolutely could be But Im not Im shamelessly wondering how his skin would feel under my fingertips how my body would react to having every ounce of that intense focus on me Heat races through my veins and stings my cheeks A repetitive smacking sound draws my attention to the right where Ridoc is tapping out with zeal Imogen drops him leaving him gasping for breath on the mat and an unwanted and absolutely illogical flash of ugly twisted jealousy stabs me straight in the chest at the pure yearning she cant hide in her expression as she watches Xaden and Garrick If you guys are this easily distracted were fucked for the Squad Battle Dain barks You can kiss any thought of visiting the front lines goodbye We all snap out of it and I shake my head like that might clear the dizzying need that demands I do more than look at Xaden which is justridiculous He only tolerates my existence because our dragons are mated and here I am salivating over his halfnaked body Its a really nice halfnaked body though Get back to work We have another half hour Dain orders and I feel like hes talking directly to me which would be the first thing hes said since my memory got Amber killed She got herself killed by breaking the Codex Tairn growls Sure enough when I glance his way Dains eyes are narrowed on me but I must be reading his face wrong Surely thats not betrayal pursing his lips Should we Rhiannon asks lifting her staff Yep we definitely should I roll my shoulders and we start again I match her move for move using the patterns she taught me but she switches up the next attack Stop defending and go on offense Tairn demands his anger flooding my system and throwing off my footwork Rhiannon sweeps low and flips me onto my back knocking the wind out of me as I collide with the mat I fight for air that isnt there Shit Im sorry Vi Rhiannon drops down to a knee beside me Just relax and give it a second And yet that is the rider Tairn chose Jack mocks talking to someone in his squad as he grins maliciously at the edge of the mat Im starting to think he chose wrong but considering I havent seen you wield any powers I bet youre thinking the same thing too arent you Sorrengail Shouldnt you have twice the ability to channel with two dragons It doesnt work like that with Andarna but none of them know that Liam stands putting himself between Jack and me as the first trickle of air dances into my lungs Simmer down Mairi Im not going to attack your little charge Not when I can just challenge her in a couple of weeks and accidentally snap her scrawny neck in front of an audience Jack folds his arms across his chest and watches me struggle with pure pleasure Tell me though you are getting tired of playing the nursemaid arent you His friend from First Wing offers him somethinga slice of the orange hes eatingand Jack shoves his hand away at the wrist Get that noxious shit away from me Do you want me to end up in the infirmary Walk the fuck away Barlowe Liam warns dagger in hand I manage one breath then two as Jacks gaze rises from me to someone standing behind me That look on his face half envy half shitting himself means it has to be Xaden Shes only alive because of you Jack spits but the blood drains from his face Right because Im the one who buried a dagger in your shoulder at Threshing Finally breathing somewhat normally I scramble for my feet clutching the staff with both hands We could just settle this now Jack says sidestepping Liam to look me in the eyes If youre done hiding behind the big strong men My stomach hollows out because hes right The only reason I dont accept his challenge is because Im not sure Ill win and the only reason he isnt attacking me is because of Liam and Xaden If I attack Jack now theyll kill him Garricks hulking frame appears to the left and I begrudgingly add him to my list of protectors Hell even Imogen has inched closer but not on my behalf Its only on his Thats what I thought Jack says blowing me a kiss You ran I snarl wishing I could lunge forward and beat the shit out of him but forcing my feet to stay planted where they are That day in the field you fucking ran when it was three on one and we both know when it comes down to it youll run again Thats what cowards do Jack flushes his eyes nearly bugging out of his face Oh for fucks sake Violet Dain mutters Shes not wrong Xaden drawls Garrick laughs and Liam muscles Jack off the mat when he leaps at me Jacks boots squeak against the hardwood floor as he unsuccessfully fights to hold his ground and Liam forces him from the gym With a flick of his hand Xaden shuts the huge doors with his power locking Jack out What the hell were you thinking egging him on like that Dain marches toward me disbelief raising his brows Oh now you feel like talking to me I lift my chin but its Xaden who fills my vision as he steps between us The fury in his eyes is palpable but I dont retreat Give us a second His gaze is locked on mine but we both know hes not talking to me My pulse skitters Rhiannon steps back You want to tell me why the fuck youre not wearing that His tone is soft but deadly as he points toward the bench where my armor lies I have to wash it at some point And you thought that would be a good idea during sparring His chest heaves like hes battling to keep control of himself Im just trying not to notice his chest or the heat hes throwing off like a damned furnace I washed it before sparring knowing it could dry while your guard dog keeps watch as opposed to sleeping without it because we both know what happens behind locked doors around here Not behind yours anymore His jaw ticks I made sure of it Because Im supposed to trust you Yes A vein in his neck bulges And you make it so easy Sarcasm drips from my voice You know I cant kill you Fuck Sorrengail the entire quadrant knows I cant kill you He leans into my space eclipsing the rest of the room That doesnt mean you cant hurt me He blinks and shifts backward composing himself in less than a heartbeat while mine still races Stop training with a bow staff Its too easy to knock out of your hands Stick to the daggers To my surprise he doesnt snatch it away just to prove he can I was doing just fine until Tairn barged into my head with all his anger and distracted me I argue my defenses rising like the hackles of a dog Then learn how to block him out He says it like its just that simple What with all this power Im wielding My brows rise Or were you unaware that Im still not channeling I want to throttle him to shake some everloving sense into that beautiful head of his He leans in so were almost nose to nose I am annoyingly aware of everything you do Thanks to Liam Every inch of my body vibrates with anger with irritation withwhatever this electric tension is between us as we stand there our eyes locked in combat Wingleader Riorson Dain starts Shes just not used to the bond yet Shell learn how to block it out Dains words sting like a blow I inhale sharply and step back from Xaden Good gods weve been putting on a fucking show What is it about Xaden that makes me tune out the rest of the world You choose the oddest times to defend her Aetos Xaden all but rolls his eyes as he looks at Dain And the most convenient times not to Dains jaw clenches and his hands curl into fists at his sides Hes talking about Amber I know it Dain knows it Everyone in this whole awkward room knows it Our entire squad was there when Dain demanded I call Xaden a liar Xaden turns those unfathomable eyes back on me Do us both a favor and put the fucking armor back on he finishes Before I can counter he turns and walks off the mat meeting Garrick at the edge His back My quiet gasp is uncontrollable and Xaden tenses for a second before taking his shirt from Garricks outstretched hand and tugging it over his head covering the navyblue relic of a dragon that sweeps from his waist to over both shoulderstextured intricately with raised silver lines I couldnt see from across the gym Silver lines I instantly recognize as scars You held your own and controlled your temper Tairn says an immense swell of pride flooding my chest Shes ready Andarna adds with a giddy jolt of joy that makes me instantly lightheaded Shes ready he agrees A couple of hours later I rip my brush through my hair in the privacy of my room still fully dressed down to my boots and armor I still cant believe I made an ass of myself in front of my entire squad simply because Xaden decided to train shirtless I really need to get laid I pause midbrushstroke when a rush of energy races down my spine dissipating in a heartbeat Well thatsweird Maybe its No It cant be It felt completely different when Andarna stopped time through me That was a fullbody flood that expanded through my fingers and toes thenleft afterward Another wave ripples through me stronger this time and I drop the brush clutching the edge of the dresser so I dont fall as my knees threaten to buckle The energy doesnt dissipate this time it sticks around humming under my skin ringing in my ears overwhelming every sense Something within me expands somehow too big for my own body too vast to be contained and pain sears every nerve as I crack open the sound reverberating through my skull like bones shattering Its as though Ive been split at the very seams of the fabric of my being My knees hit the floor and I throw my hands over my temples trying to shove everything I am back into my skull forcing myself to shrink Energy pours ina deluge of raw endless powereroding everything I was and forging something completely new as it fills every pore every organ every bone My head screams and it feels like Tairn has flown too high too fast and I cant pop my ears All I can do is lie there on the floor and pray the pressure equalizes I stare at my brush the hardwood floor biting into my cheek and breathe In and then out Inand then outsurrendering to the onslaught Finally the pain ebbs but the energythe powerdoesnt Its simplythere prowling through my veins saturating every cell in my body It is everything I am and everything I can be all at once I sit up slowly and flip my hands to examine my tingling palms It feels like they should look different changed but theyre not Theyre still my fingers my slender wrists and yet theyre so much more now Theyre strong enough to shape the torrent inside me to mold it into whatever I desire This is your power isnt it I ask Tairn but he doesnt answer Andarna Theres only silence Go figure theyre always around pushing into my head when I could use a little space then nowhere to be found when its the other way around Id heard them say I was ready earlier but I figured it would take a day or two for my mind to fully open that pathway once Tairn started channeling Guess not Rhiannon I have to tell Rhiannon Shes going to flip that I can finally go to Professor Carrs class with her And Liam He can stop pretending that he cant channel just so he isnt forced to leave me for an hour a day Heat washes over me prickling my skin and centering low in my stomach Odd but whatever Its probably just a side effect of the power I throw open the lock on my door and yank it open My vision blurs and need slams into me robbing me of every logical thought besides satiating the overwhelming Violet The fuzzy shape of a man stands in the hallway and I blink Liam into focus You all right Are you sleeping in the hallway I grip the doorframe as an image of falling fills my mind and I feel the sizzle of flakes as they make contact with my heated skin Its gone as quickly as it appeared but the driving thundering desire remains Oh shit This islust No Liam shakes his head Just hanging out here before turning in I look at him then Really honestly look at him Hes more than handsome with strong features and skyblue eyes that are startlingly beautiful Why are you looking at me like that He sets his knife and semicarved dragon down Like what My teeth sink into my bottom lip and I debate rubbing against him like a cat in heat while demanding he appease this unimaginable ache But hes not who you really want Hes not Xaden Like He cocks his head to the side Like somethings going on You dont look like you feelyou knowlike yourself Oh shit Its because Im not myself All of this the need the lust the craving for the one person who Im meant to be withits Tairn Tairns emotions arent just overwhelming me theyre controlling me Im good Go to bed I step back into my room and slam the door while I still have the mental capacity to do so Then I start pacing but that doesnt stop the next blast of heat or the compulsion to I have to get out of here before I make an epic mistake and take Tairns feelings out on Liam Grabbing my furlined cloak in one hand and pulling my hair up with the other I swirl the fabric over my shoulders and fasten the clip beneath my throat A second later I peek out the door and when Im sure the coast is clear I fucking flee I make it to the entrance of the spiral stepsthe ones that lead to the riverbefore I have to lean back against the stone wall and breathe through the fog of Tairns emotions Once the wave passes I race down the steps keeping one hand on the wall in case Im pulled under again The mage lights flicker on as I approach and fizzle out as I race by as though this newfound power is already at work stretching into the world Away I have to get away from everyone until Tairn finisheswhatever he and Sgaeyl are doing I stumble out of the stairwell and emerge at the foundation walls of the citadel Snow fills the sky and I tip my head back savoring the brief kiss of snowflakes on skin thats heated for all the wrong reasons The air is crisp and chilled and My eyes pop open at the scent in the air and I whirl my cloak whipping out behind me as I find the source of the sweet easily identifiable smoke Xaden is leaning back against the wall one foot braced on the stone smoking and watching me like he doesnt have a care in the world Is thatchuram He blows out a puff of smoke Want some Unless youre here to continue our earlier argument in which case none for you My jaw practically unhinges No Were not allowed to smoke that Yeah well the people who made that rule obviously werent bonded to Sgaeyl and Tairn now were they A smirk lifts a corner of his mouth Gods I could stare at his lips forever They are perfectly shaped and yet entirely too decadent for the slashing line of his jaw It helps withdistancing yourself He offers me the rolled churam and cocks an eyebrow at methe one with the scar Beyond what shielding does of course I shake my head and cross through the newly fallen snow to brace my weight on the wall beside him letting my head fall back against the stone Suit yourself He inhales deeply on the churam and then puts it out against the wall I feel like Im on fucking fire Thats putting it mildly Yeah That happens His laugh holds a wicked edge and I make the utterly unforgivable mistake of turning to see his smile Xaden while brooding and bossy dangerous and lethal is a toecurling sight that makes my pulse quicken But Xaden laughing his head thrown back with a smile curving his mouth is dropdead beautiful My stupid foolish heart feels like theres a fist around it squeezing tight There is nothing I wouldnt sacrifice nothing I wouldnt give to have one unguarded moment with this man Im going to be tethered to for the rest of our lives This has to be Tairn It justhas to And yet I know it isnt While Id admired Liam upstairs I am completely utterly obsessed with Xaden His eyes meet mine in the moonlight Oh Violence youre going to have to learn to shield against Tairn or his escapades with Sgaeyl will drive you mador into someones bed I squeeze my eyes shut just so I can escape his gorgeous face as a jolt of heat flashes through me making every inch of my skin tingle and burn I reach a hand out to steady myself against the wall again Oh I know I am horrified to see Liam again Liam Why He pivots to face me leaning against his shoulder Where the hell is your bodyguard Im my own bodyguard I counter resting my cheek on the icy stone And hes in bed Your bed His voice is like a crack of lightning I pry my eyes open to meet his gaze The snow makes everything so much brighter highlighting the furrowed line of his brow the firm set of his mouth No Not that it should matter to you Is he jealous Thatsoddly comforting He looses a breath his shoulders dipping It doesnt matter to me as long as youre both consenting and trust me youre in no condition to consent You have no clue what Im capable of consenting Undeniable unquenchable need nearly takes me out at the knees Xadens arm wraps around my waist steadying me Why the hell arent you shielding Not all of us have been given lessons He just started channeling before allthis and in case you forgot youre only allowed to attend Professor Carrs class if you can wield Always thought that was a ridiculous rule He sighs All right Crash course Only because Ive been where you are and woken up with more than a few regrets Youre actually going to help me Ive been helping you for months His hand flexes at my waist and I swear I can feel the warmth of his touch through my cloak and leathers No you sent Liam to help Hes been helping me for months My forehead puckers Weeks Almost months Whatever He has the nerve to look offended Im the one who burst through your door and killed everyone who attacked you and then I removed the other threat to your life with a very public very polarizing display of vengeance Liam didnt do that I did The crowd wasnt polarized They were all for it I was there You were torn In fact you begged Tairn not to kill her damn well knowing shed just come after you again That point was still debatable Fine But lets not pretend that you didnt do most of that for yourself It would be inconvenient for you if I died I shrug blatantly poking at him to help ignore the rising tide of lust thundering through me He stares at me with disbelief You know what Were not fighting tonight Not if you want to learn how to shield Fine Were not fighting Teach me I tilt my chin Gods I barely reach his collarbone Ask me nicely He leans closer Have you always been this tall I blurt the first thing that comes to mind No I was a child at some point I roll my eyes Ask me nicely Violence he whispers Or Im gone I can feel Tairn at the edge of my mind his emotions ebbing and flowing and know the next wave is going to hit hard How freaking long can those two possibly take How often is it like this with them Often enough that youre going to need proper shields You wont ever be able to block them out completely and sometimes they forget to block us like tonight Thats why the churam helps but at least its like walking by a brothel instead of actively participating in one Wellshit Right then All right Will you teach me to shield A smile curves his mouth and my gaze drops to his lips Say please Are you always this difficult Only when I know I have something you need What can I say I like making you squirm Its like a sweet little slice of payback for what youve put me through these last couple of months He brushes the snow off my hair What Ive put you through Unbelievable Youve scared me nearly to death once or twice so I think saying please is a fair request Like hes ever played fair a day in his life I take a deep breath and swat at a snowflake that lands on my nose As you prefer Xaden I smile sweetly up at him and inch a little closer Would you pretty pretty please teach me how to shield before I accidentally climb you like a tree and we both wake up with regrets Oh Im firmly in control of my faculties He smiles again and I feel it like a caress Dangerous This is so damned dangerous Heat flushes my skin so hot that I debate tossing my cloak to the ground just to get a little relief Notably Xaden isnt wearing one And since you asked so nicely He adjusts his stance and brings both his hands up to my cheeks cradling my face before sliding them back to hold my head Close your eyes It requires touching me My eyes flutter shut at the sensation of his skin against mine Not at all Just one of the perks of not thinking too clearly You have incredibly touchable skin The compliment makes me suck in a breath So much for controlling his faculties You need to envision somewhere Anywhere I prefer the top of my favorite hillside near whats left of Aretia Wherever it is it needs to feel like home The only place I can think of is the Archives Feel your feet hit the ground and dig in some I imagine my boots on the polished marble floor of the Archives and wiggle them a little Got it Thats called grounding keeping your mental self somewhere so you arent swept away by the power Now call to your power Open your senses My palms begin to tingle and a flood of energy surrounds me just as saturating as it was in my bedroom but without the pain Its everywhere filling the Archives and pushing at the walls making them bow and bend threatening to break them Too much Focus on your feet Stay grounded Can you see where the power flows from If not just pick a place I turn in my mind The barrage of molten power is flowing through the door I see it Perfect Youre a natural It takes most people a week just to learn how to ground Now do whatever you need to mentally do to wall yourself off from that current Tairn is the source You block that power and youll have some control back The door I just need to close the door and twist the enormous circular handle that seals the Archives off for fire control Desire makes my heart pound and I grab on to Xadens arms anchoring myself in reality Youve got this His voice sounds strained Whatever you create in your mind is real to you Shut off the valve Build a wall Whatever makes sense Its a door My fingers dig into the soft material of his tunic and I mentally heave myself against the door forcing it shut one inch at a time There you go Keep going My physical body trembles at the effort it takes to mentally shove the door closed but I get it there Ive got the door shut Great Lock it I imagine spinning the giant handle and hearing the locks click into place The relief is immediate a cool blast of snow against my feverish skin Power pulses turning the door clear It changed I can see through the door Yeah Youll never be able to fully block him Got it locked I nod Open your eyes but do your best to keep that door locked It means keeping one foot grounded Dont be surprised if it slips Well just start again I open my eyes keeping that mental picture of the shut Archives door and while my body is still heated and flushed with warmth that inescapable driving need is blessedlysomewhat muted Hes I cant find the right words Xaden studies me with an intensity that makes me sway toward him You are astonishing He shakes his head I couldnt do that for weeks Guess I have a superior teacher The emotion swelling through me is more than joy Its euphoria that has me grinning like a fool Im finally not only good at something but astonishing His thumbs stroke over the soft skin under my ears and his gaze drops to my mouth and heats Hands flexing he draws me forward a few inches before he suddenly lets go and retreats a full step Damn it Touching you was a bad idea The worst I agree but my tongue skims my lower lip He groans and my core melts at the sound Kissing you would be a cataclysmic mistake Calamitous What would it take to hear that groan again The inches between us feel like kindling ready to burn at the first suggestion of heat and Im a living breathing flame This is everything I should run from and yet denying the primal attraction I feel is completely utterly impossible Well both regret it He shakes his head but theres more than hunger in his eyes as he stares at my lips Naturally I whisper But knowing Ill regret it doesnt stop me from wanting itwanting him Regretting is a problem for future Violet Fuck it One second hes out of reach and the next his mouth is on mine hot and insistent Gods yes This is exactly what I need Im trapped between the immovable stone of the wall and the hard lines of Xadens body and theres nowhere else Id rather be The thought should sober me but all I do is lean in for more He tunnels a hand through my hair cradling the back of my head angling me for a deeper kiss and my lips part eagerly He takes the invitation sliding his tongue along mine with expert teasing strokes that have me clutching at his chest fisting the material of his shirt to pull him closer as desire dances up and down my spine He tastes like churam and mint like everything Im not supposed to want and yet cant help needing and I kiss him back with everything I have sucking on his lower lip and scraping my teeth over him Violence he moans and the sound of the nickname on his lips makes me ravenous Closer I need him closer As though he can hear my thoughts he kisses me harder claiming every line and curve of my mouth with a reckless edge that makes my body sing Hes just as needy as I am and when he shifts his grip to my ass and picks me up I wrap my legs around his waist and hold on like my life depends on this kiss never ending The wall digs into my back but I dont care My hands are finally in his hair and its just as soft as I imagined He kisses me until I feel thoroughly devoured and explored and then he sucks my tongue into his mouth so I can do the same This is complete and utter madness and yet I cant stop Cant get enough I could live forever in this tiny slice of insanity if it means keeping his mouth on mine leaving my world narrowed to the heat of his body and the skilled stroke of his tongue His hips rock into mine and I gasp at the delicious friction He breaks the kiss sliding his mouth across my jaw my neck and I know Ill do anything to keep him here with me I want to feel his mouth everywhere Were a tangle of tongues and teeth questing lips and hands as the snow falls around us and the kiss consumes me the same way the power had before so thoroughly I can feel it in every cell in my body Need pulses between my thighs and I jolt at the simple knowledge that theres nothing he could do that I wouldnt welcome I want him Only him Here Now Anywhere Whenever Ive never been this out of control over a single kiss Never wanted someone the way I do him Its exhilarating and terrifying at the same time because I know that in this moment he has the power to break me And Id let him I surrender completely melting into him my body going pliant against his and losing that mental foothold he calls grounding A flash of light burns behind my closed eyes followed by the boom of thunder Thundersnow isnt uncommon around here but damn does it summarize how this feels wild and out of control But then he breaks the kiss with a sharp gasp his brow furrowing with something akin to panic before he slams his eyes shut Im still struggling to draw a full breath when he abruptly steps away from the wall and palms the backs of my thighs setting me on my feet again He makes sure Im steady and then retreats a few feet like the distance will save his life You have to go His words are clipped and at odds with the heat in his eyes his ragged breaths Why The cold is a shock to my system without his body heat Because I cant He rakes both hands through his hair and leaves them on the top of his head And I refuse to act on desire that isnt yours So you have to walk back up those steps Now I shake my head But I want Everything This isnt your want He tilts his head up at the sky Thats the fucking problem And I cant leave you out here on your own so have just a little mercy on me and go Silence ices over between us as I get ahold of myself Hes saying no And the shitty part about it isnt the chill of chivalrous rejection Its that hes right This started because I couldnt tell Tairns emotions from my own But those emotions are gone arent they My door is wide open and I dont feel anything coming from Tairns direction I manage a nod and then I flee for the second time tonight climbing the steps as quickly as possible to get back to the citadel My shields are open but I dont bother stopping to shut that mental door since Tairn isnt barging through Common sense prevails by the time I reach the top my thighs burning from the workout Xaden stopped us from making a huge mistake But I didnt What the hell is wrong with me And how could I have been a heartbeat away from ripping off my clothes to get closer to someone I dont like and even worsecant fully trust Its harder than it should be to keep moving in the direction of my dorm room when all I want is to go right back down those stupid freaking steps Tomorrow is going to suck The most worrisome sight for any instructor is most definitely when powers backfire We lost nine cadets my first year to signets that could not be controlled from their first manifestation Pity Major Afendras Guide to the Riders Quadrant Unauthorized Edition CHAPTER TWENTYTHREE I dont even know what I was thinking I say to Rhiannon as I sit crosslegged on her bed watching her pack her satchel with books for the afternoon The relic on my back burns today as if it needs to remind me that I can channel now and I roll my shoulders to try and relieve the sensation but its impossible My clock has started I cant believe you managed to wait this long to tell me She lifts the canvas strap over her head and turns leaning back against her desk And thats not judgment Far from it Im all for you exploringwhatever it is you want to explore Ive been with Liam from the second I walked out the door this morning and last night I was a little too discombobulated to put it into words The knot between my shoulders has me rolling my neck looking for some relief With flight lessons and Imogen using weight training to strengthen the muscles around my joints in hopes they wont subluxate as oftenwhich is hit or miss right nowIm a mass of aches and tightness Between Tairn finally channeling and then everything else it was just a night Good point A grin shapes her mouth and her brown eyes sparkle Was it good Tell me it was good That man looks like he knows exactly what hes doing It was just a kiss Heat sings in my cheeks at the blatant lie But yeah He knows exactly what hes doing My brow furrows my imagination running through the thousand different consequences of what I did last night just like it has been all morning Second thoughts She tilts her head studying me You look like maybe there are third thoughts even No I shake my head Well maybe But only if it makes stuff between us weird Right Because youre stuck with him for the rest of your careers Lives too Have you guys talked about what happens after he graduates Her eyebrows rise Oh I bet you get the choice of duty stations Wingleaders always get to pick Hell get to pick I grumble toying with an errant string on my satchel I will have to follow Tairn and Sgaeyl havent been separated for years Her last rider died almost fifty years ago and as far as I know she flew wherever and whenever she wanted to be near Tairn before Naolinhis last riderdied in Tyrrendor Its a twoday flight to that part of our border depending on where hes stationed so what are we going to do next year and the year after Her lips purse Not sure Feirge said we wont be able to be apart more than a couple of days so does that mean one of you has to always follow the other No clue I think thats why most mated pairs bond within the same year so they dont have these issues How am I supposed to remain competitive next year if Im constantly flying off to the front line with Tairn How is Xaden supposed to be effective if he has to fly back here all the time My face scrunches Hes the most powerful rider of our generation Hes going to be needed on the front not here For now Rhiannon stares at me with intention lifting her brows Hes the most powerful rider in our generation for now What Three knocks have both of us looking toward her door Rhi Liam asks panic evident in his voice Is Sorrengail in there with you Because Rhiannon opens the door and Liam stumbles inside catching his balance before his gaze sweeps the room finding mine There you are I went to the bathroom and you disappeared No ones trying to assassinate her in my room Mairi Rhiannon rolls her eyes You dont have to be with her every second of every fucking day Now give us five minutes and then well start walking to class She pushes at his chest and he retreats his mouth opening and shutting like hes trying to think of an argument but cant as she forces him out the door and shuts it in his face Hes I sigh Dedicated Thats one word for it she mutters Youd think that guy owes Riorson his life or something the way he sticks to you like glue Hes pretty much told me that he does but I keep that confidence to myself Between Xadens meetings stopping time and Andarnas age Im starting to keep too many secrets Oh Her eyes light up and she sits on the edge of the bed next to me Something happened with me last night too Yeah I pivot to face her Do go on All right She takes a deep breath Ive only done it three times Twice last night and once this morning so be patient for a second Of course I nod Watch the book on my desk Got it My gaze locks on the history textbook on the lefthand side of the desk A minute passes but I dont look away Then the thing vanishes What the hell Rhi I fly to my feet and whip my head toward her What just My mouth drops Shes holding the book looking up at me with a wide grin Is that the same book I lean in just to see Yep its the same I guess I can summon Her grin grows even wider Holy shit I grasp her shoulders in excitement Thats amazing Thatsincredible I dont even have words for what that is Moving objects and locking doors are the small magics the baseline of wielding that comes from our constant connection to our dragons through our relics once they begin channeling But making something disappear and bringing it to you I havent read about a signet power like that in a century Its a hell of a signet Right She clutches the book to her chest I can only do it from a few feet away and I cant go through walls or anything Yet I correct her joy bubbling through me You cant go through walls yet Rhi Thats the kind of rare signet thats going to make your entire career I hope so She stands putting the book back on her desk I just have to develop it You will I say it with the same assurance I feel The three of us walk toward the academic wing minutes later joined by Sawyer and Ridoc as they come out of commons fresh from the library I finished this for you Liam says handing me a figurine as we climb the wide spiral staircase to the third floor Its Tairn Hes even mastered his snarl This isincredible Thank you Thanks Liam gives me a grin flashing his dimple I wanted to carve Andarna first but Im not around her as much you know Shes pretty private We break off from the crowd headed to the fourth floor and I stash the dragon in my bag then reach out and give him a hug Really I love it Thank you The hallway is crowded but clears as we walk farther down nearing Professor Carrs room Youre welcome He turns to Rhiannon Im starting Feirge next Rhiannon jokes with Liam that she hopes he captures her full badassery but I lose the rest of the conversation as I glance toward the floortoceiling window before the entrance to the Battle Brief tower and my breath catches Xaden is standing with the other wingleaders locked in what looks to be a tense discussion his arms folded across his chest It took the commandant all of five minutes to appoint Lamani Zohar as wingleader for Third Wing after Amber was executed but since she was already executive officer it made the most sense Ill never get over how quickly people move on around here how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later Gods Xaden looks good today his brow slightly furrowed as he listens intently to something Lamani says then nods Hard to believe I had that mouth on mine last night those arms wrapped around me Forget second thoughts I just want more As if he feels me staring Xaden lifts his head his gaze colliding with mine across the space with the same effect as a touch My pulse skitters and my lips part Were going to be late Rhi reminds me glancing back over her shoulder Xaden looks behind me and his mouth tenses Vi can we talk Dain asks a little out of breath like hes run to catch up to me Now I rip my gaze from Xadens and turn to face the person I thought was my best friend Dain grimaces rubbing a hand behind his neck and nods I tried to catch you after formation but you disappeared pretty quickly and after what happened last night I figure now is better than later It might be convenient for you to want to talk after weeks of ignoring me but I have class right now I grip the strap of my satchel We have a couple of minutes The plea in his eyes is so heavy that I feel the weight of it on my chest Please I glance at Rhiannon who is glaring at Dain with her true feelings for once instead of the deference owed him as our squad leader Ill be right in She glances at me and then nods heading into Carrs room with the rest of our squad I follow Dain out of the doorway to a place along the wall where we wont obstruct traffic You let Tairn share your memory with everyone instead of just showing me yourself he blurts his hands falling to his sides Im sorry What the hell is he talking about When all that shit went down with Amber I asked you to show me what happened and you refused He shifts his weight just one of his nervous tells and the motion strips away some of my anger When push comes to shove hes my oldest friend even if hes being an ass I didnt believe you and that part is on me He raises his hand over his heart I should have believed you but I couldnt reconcile the woman I knew with what you were saying and you didnt come find me after the attack either Hurt laces his tone I had to hear about it in formation Vi Regardless of the fight we had on the flight field youre stillyou to me And my best friend had been viciously attacked nearly killed and you didnt say a single word about it You didnt ask I say softly You reached for my head like you were entitled to my memory after blatantly telling me you didnt believe me and you demanded I show you Its everything I can do to keep my voice even Two lines appear between his eyebrows I didnt ask You didnt ask I shake my head And after being told countless times that Im not tough enough for this place not strong enoughwell what happened on the flight field was a long time coming between you and me The worst part is that I knew you wouldnt believe me Its why I almost didnt tell Xaden who it was because I was sure he wouldnt believe me either But he did Dains voice drops and his jaw ticks And he was the one who killed them in your bedroom Because Tairn told Sgaeyl I fold my arms across my chest Not because he was already there or anything And I know you hate him You have every reason to hate him too he reminds me reaching for me before thinking better of it and drawing his hand back I know that I counter His father put an arrow in Brennans chest according to battlefield reports I live with that knowledge every day But dont you think he sees me and remembers that my mother put his father to death Its The right words are hard to find Its complicated between us Images of last night flood my mind from Xadens first smile to the last brush of his lips and I shove them away Dain flinches You trust him more than you trust me Its not an accusation but it stings all the same Thats not it My stomach twists Wait Is it true I justI have to trust him Dain Not with everything of course Shit Im tying myself into knots here Neither of us can do anything about Sgaeyl and Tairn being mated and trust me neither of us likes the situation but we have to figure out a way through it We dont have a choice Dain mutters a curse but he doesnt disagree I know you just want to keep me safe Dain I whisper But keeping me safe is keeping me from growing too He blinks at me and something shifts between us Like maybe just maybe hes finally ready to hear me When you told me that this place strips everything away from you to reveal whats underneath I was afraid What if underneath the brittle bones and frail ligaments there was just more weakness Only this time I wouldnt be able to blame my body Youve never been weak to me Vi Dain starts but I shake my head Dont you get it I interrupt It doesnt matter what you thinkit only matters what I think And you were right But the Riders Quadrant stripped away the fear and even the anger about being thrown into this quadrant and it revealed who I really am At my core Dain Im a rider Tairn knew it Andarna knew it Its why they chose me And until you can stop looking for ways to keep me in a glass cage we arent going to get past this no matter how many years of friendship we have between us He glances over my shoulder And what Riorson gets a free pass for his control issues Because last time I checked Liam was moved into our squad specifically to shadow you Its an excellent point Liam is around because even the strongest rider cant watch their back from more than thirty unbonded cadets gunning for them And if I die Xaden dies Whats your excuse Dain tenses like a statue only the muscle in his jaw ticking before he eventually leans forward and whispers Look you dont know everything there is to know about Xaden Vi I have a higher security clearance due to my signet and you need to be careful Xaden has secrets reasons to never forgive your mother and I dont want him to use you to get his revenge My hackles rise Theres a sliver of truth in what hes saying but I dont have time to focus on the confusion that is Xaden right now One screwedup relationship at a time I narrow my gaze as Dain shuffles his feet again a kernel of a suspicion growing in my chest Wait did you keep begging me to leave Basgiath because you didnt think I could survive hereor because you were trying to get me away from Xaden I shake my head before he can answer You know what Its irrelevant And I mean it You only want to keep me safe I appreciate that But it stops now Dain Xaden is tied to me because of Sgaeyl Nothing more I do not need protection and if I doIve got two badass dragons who have my back Can you respect that He reaches up to cup my cheek and I hold his gaze determined for him to understand he either starts valuing my choices or we are never going to fix our friendship All right Vi His eyes crinkle at the sides as his mouth turns up into a half smile How can I argue with someone who has two badass dragons A weight shifts in my chest and suddenly I can breathe again I toss him a cheeky grin Exactly Im sorry for not asking for the memory He drops his hand to my shoulder Youd better get to class And then he squeezes my shoulder gently before walking away I let out a shaky breath and turn back to the door for Carrs class The hallway is empty I head into Carrs room a massively long chamber with padded walls and no windows The entire length is lit by chandeliers of mage lights bright enough to emulate daylight over three dozen students from Third and Fourth Wing who are seated in rows on the floor evenly spaced to give one another the most room Rhiannon and Liam meet me at the door and Professor Carr raises his bushy white brows at me when we approach where hes positioned at the front of the room dominating the space by doing nothing more than standing there The man isnt just imposing hes intimidating as fuck I swallow remembering how he snapped Jeremiahs neck Finally ready to join us Cadet Sorrengail Theres no kindness in his eyes merely shrewd clinical observation Yes sir I nod He studies me like Im a bug pinned to the wall in the biology room Signet power Not yet I shake my head keeping the whole timestopping thing to myself like Xaden suggested You trust him more than you trust me In this regard Dain is right and guilt drops my stomach I see He clucks his tongue glancing over at me You know your siblings were both gifted by extraordinary signet powers Miras ability to manifest a ward around her and her squad has been an absolute asset to her wing and shes been highly decorated for her valor behind enemy lines Yes Mira is an inspiration I force a smile more than aware of my sisters prowess on the battlefield And Brennan He looks away Menders are so very rare and to lose one so young was tragic I think losing Brennan is the tragedy I heft my satchel up higher on my shoulder But the loss of his signet was a definite blow to the wings Hmm He blinks twice and turns his chilling gaze back on me Well it seems the Sorrengail line is blessed even in a rider aswell delicate as you are With Tairn having chosen you well expect nothing but an earthshattering signet from you Take a seat You can at least start with the lesser magics through your relic He waves me off No pressure I mutter as we walk to obviously empty places in the line with the rest of our squad Dont stress Rhiannon says as we take our seats on the padded floor Thats what I was trying to remind you of earlier You are Tairns rider What do you mean I set my satchel down next to me Youre all worried about the integrity of the wing because Riorson might have to visit to keep his dragon happy but Violet hes not the most powerful rider of our generation You are She holds my gaze just long enough to let me know she means it My heart lurches into my throat Now lets begin Carr calls out December turns to January Ground Shield Imagine closing your door Build your wall Sense who and what has access around you Trace the bond to your dragon Dragons in my case Build a second entrancea windowinto the archive of my power for Andarnas golden energy Block those bonds as far as you can Visualize Imagine a knot of powernot too intricate no ones ready for that yetin front of you then untangle it Unlock the door Visualize Keep one foot firmly grounded at all times Youre useless unless youre connected to your power and youre dangerous if you cant contain it There is only the inbetween that makes you a great rider Envision your power like a hand gripping that pencil and bringing it toward you Pick it up No Not like that Try again No again VISUALIZE I study for tests I prep for flights I lift weights with Imogen I wonder how long Xaden is going to make me put in hours on the mat with Rhiannon I win my first challenge earning a dagger from a girl in Second Wing But the most exhausting assignment is spending endless hours in the archive of my mind learning which door is Tairns and which belongs to Andarna then working diligently to separate the two It turns out that while my power might flow from my dragons the ability to control it comes from my own exertion and there are nights I fall into bed plunging into sleep before I even remove my boots By the end of the second week in January Im not only pissed that Xaden hasnt bothered to talk to me about that kiss but exhausted and thats without a signet power manifesting draining my energy to control it Ridoc can wield ice which might be a more common signet but its impressive to see Sawyers metallurgy powers grow every day Liam can see a single tree miles away I guess I can stop time but Im not willing to drain Andarna just for the sake of trying again not when it took her more than a week of straight sleeping to recover Without a signet all I can wield are the lesser magics I finally use an ink pen lock a door and open it Im a party trick By the third week in January I earn yet another dagger in a challenge against a guy in Third Wing my second without weakening my opponent with poisons It leaves me with a sore wrist but my joints are intact And in the fourth week during the coldest weather Ive ever experienced at Basgiath I sneak out in the middle of the night to see the challenge board Jack has finally been given the chance to end me on the mat tomorrow Hes going to kill me Thats all I can think as I dress for the morning sheathing all of my daggers in the most advantageous places Hes going to try Tairn is up early Any advice I know Liam is waiting for us to make the library run before breakfast Dont let him I scoff He makes it sound so damned simple Were already on our way back from the library when I finally work up the nerve to talk to Liam about it If I tell you something will you report it to Xaden His head whips in my direction as he pushes the cart over the bridge between the quadrants Why would you think Oh come on I roll my eyes We both know you report just about everything I do Im not ignorant Snow pelts the windows making a dull chiming sound He worries I alleviate worries He glances at me again before looking forward I know its not fair I know its a breach of your privacy But its nothing compared to what I owe him Yeah I got that part I hurry ahead and open the thick heavy door into the citadel so he can pass through Maybe I should rephrase my question If I were to tell you something and ask you specifically to keep this one thing between the two of us would you agree Are we friends or am I just your assignment He pauses while I shut the door and I can tell hes thinking by the way he drums his fingers on the handle of the cart Would me keeping it to myself alter your safety in any way No I catch up to him and we start along the incline that will eventually split into two tunnelsone toward the dormitory and the other toward commons Theres nothing you can do and thats the point Were friends Tell me He grimaces Ill keep it to myself Jack Barlowe is going to be allowed to challenge me today He stops walking so I do too How do you know that And that is why Im asking you to keep it to yourself I cringe Justtry to trust that I know The instructors cant let that happen He shakes his head panic creeping into his eyes Theyre going to I shrug forcing a tight smile Hes been asking since the first day so its not like we didnt see this coming Point is Jack is going to challenge me today and when he does you cant step in no matter what His blue eyes widen Vi if we tell Riorson he can put a stop to it No I reach for his hand and lay mine on top of it He cant My stomach twists but at least Im not puking like I did when I found out Theres only so much Xaden can do to protect me both here and once were on the front lines You and I both know that if he stops this there will be an uproar in the quadrant after what happened to Amber And you expect me to stand there and watch whatever happenshappen he asks incredulous Just like you have the last two challenges I force another smile Dont worry Im going to use everything I have to my advantage And everything I have is currently in a vial tucked into the tiny pocket at my waist I dont like this He shakes his head Yeah well that makes two of us Theres no flight field todaythe dragons have deemed it too cold to fly over the last week which means were all headed to the sparring gym after formation I dont bother with breakfast but I pay close attention to every single thing on Jacks tray as I walk by noting whats thereand what isnt My heart pounds a chaotic nauseating rhythm by the time all eightyone of the surviving firstyears gather in the gym Professor Emetterio calls out the challenges one by one assigning them to a mat At least well all fight at once which means not every rider will be watching At least Xaden isnt here which means Liam kept his word Mat seventeen Jack Barlowe from First Wing versus His eyebrows rise and he takes a deep breath Violet Sorrengail Thank gods Rhiannons already across the floor ready to challenge a woman from Third Wing so she doesnt have to see how the blood drains from Liams face She shouldnt have to see any of this Sawyers gone too over at mat nine No fucking way Ridoc mutters shaking his head Finally Jack throws his hands in the air like hes already won Lets do this I roll my shoulders and head for the mat Neither Liam nor Ridoc is called to the mat today so they walk at my sides Tell me I can break the promise Liam begs and the pleading look in his eyes tells me exactly what a shitty position Ive put him in The thirdyears are off doing thirdyear things I tell him as my toes touch the mat You cant get him here in time but I know what it means to you to keep your word Especially with him Go ahead He looks from me to Ridoc Guard her like youre me You mean like Im six inches taller and built like a bull Ridoc gives him a thumbsup Sure Ill do my best In the meantime youd better run Liams gaze finds mine Stay alive Working on it and not just for my sake I give him a smile Thanks for being a great shadow His eyes widen a split second before he sprints out of the gym Barlowe and Sorrengail Emetterio calls from the opposite side of the mat Weapons Jack bounces like a kid whos just been given a gift Anything she can hold in those puny hands of hers The look in his eyes sends a shiver of apprehension down my spine I step onto the mat and Jack does the same walking forward until were at the center facing each other No wielding Emetterio reminds us Tap out or knockout earns you a victory Pretty sure everyone gathered around this mat knows that Jack isnt going for either of those options If he gets his hands around my neck Im dead That whole IdieXadendies thing is really just a hypothesis right I ask unsheathing the daggers that are hardest to reach during a fight the ones in my boots One Id rather not put to the test Tairn growls I stand gripping the handles of my daggers as Jack faces me with a single knife Youre kidding right Only one I only need one He grins with sickening excitement Go for the gullet Tairn suggests I dont have the energy to block you out right now so Im going to need you to be quiet for a few minutes here An answering growl is the only response I get Keep it clean Emetterio warns Go My heart drums so loudly I can hear it in my ears as we begin to circle each other Offense Now Strike first Tairn snaps Not helping Jack lunges striking out with his knife and I slice my dagger across the back of his hand drawing first blood Shit He jumps back his cheeks blotching Thats what I want what I need to win this match for him to get so angry that he acts without thinking and makes a mistake He dances forward and then kicks out aiming for my midsection and I stumble back narrowly avoiding the blow Bet you wish you could throw that blade dont you he taunts knowing I wont break a rule when it can hurt someone in the matches going on around us Bet you wish you didnt know what it feels like to dig out one of my knives dont you I retort His lips press into a thin line before he comes at me in a series of punches and swipes with his dagger I cant deflecthes too strong for me as evidenced by the dagger he easily kicks out of my handso I use my speed ducking and diving while getting in another cut this one along his forearm Damn it he rages twisting to follow as I come around his back He catches me off guard locking onto my arm and flipping me over his back to the mat I take the blow on my shoulder and wince but theres no sound of tearing or snapping Thanking Imogen will be my first order of business if I make it out of this Keeping my arm locked Jack thrusts his knife straight at my chest but its deflected by my vest skimming along my ribs to lodge in the mat Hes using death blows Ridoc shouts Thats not allowed Pull it back Barlowe Emetterio bellows What do you think Sorrengail Jack whispers in my ear holding me immobile with my arm behind my back Admit it You and I both knew it would be like this between us Quick Embarrassingly easy Fatal Your precious wingleader isnt here to save you No but Xaden will sufferif not worse if Jack achieves his goal The thought spurs me to action Ignoring the pain I throw my weight into a roll subluxating my shoulder but freeing myself from his grip when he gets tangled in my legs Then I kick him straight in the balls He hits his knees as I gain my feet clutching himself as his mouth opens in a silent scream Tap out I order picking up the dagger I dropped I can cut you open at any second Both you and I know if this were real life youd be done If this were real life I would have killed you the second you stepped onto the mat he seethes through gritted teeth Tap Out Fuck off He throws his dagger I throw up my hands to block but it lodges in my left fucking forearm Blood streams and pain sears the nerves along my arm erupting with alarming poignancy but I know better than to remove it Right now its holding that wound as shut as it can No throwing Emetterio shouts from the sidelines but Jack is already moving barreling toward me with a series of kicks and punches that Im not ready for His fist slams into my cheek and I feel the skin split His knee forces the air from my body when he rams it into my stomach But I stay on my feet until his hands clasp my face Agony fills every cell in my body as violent vibrating energy rips through me with an intensity that makes it feel like hes cleaving ligament from bone muscle from tendon I scream as Im shaken by an internal force I dont understand as though hes forcing his own power into my body shocking me with a thousand stings of vibrating energy Now If I dont do it now hell kill me My vision is already darkening at the edges I reach a trembling hand into the pocket of my leathers and thumb open the stopper on the vial His sadistic grin and a red rim around his eyes are all I can see as he forces more and more power into my body but his hands are occupied and hes too obsessed with his victory to hear that Ive stopped screaming to see that Im moving Hes using his powers Ridoc roars and from the corner of my decreasing vision I see movement on both sides I shove the vial against Jacks smile so hard I feel one of his teeth break Hands reach for us both and I hear Ridoc and Emetterio cry out jerking their hands away after contact Whatever Jack is doing is transferring from me to them by touch My teeth rattle as the pain consumes me my body fighting to pass out to escape the unbearable torture but I refuse to succumb to the darkness until Jack wheezes His eyes fly impossibly wide and he drops his hands clutching his own neck as his airway closes My knees give way my body still shuddering as I hit the mat but so does Jack heaving and clawing at his neck as his face turns purple Ridocs face is in mine within seconds Breathe Sorrengail Just breathe What the hell is wrong with him someone asks as Jack writhes Oranges I whisper to Ridoc as my body finally gives out Hes allergic to oranges I fall into nothingness When I wake Im not on the mat and I can tell by the windows of the Healer Quadrant infirmary that night has fallen Ive been out for hours And thats not Ridoc lounged in the chair next to my bed glaring at me like hed like to kill me himself Its Xaden His hair is tousled like hes been tugging at it and hes flipping a dagger end over end catching it by the tip without so much as looking at it before sheathing it at his side Oranges I know you dont want to hear this but sometimes you have to know when to take the death blow Mira Its why you have to be sure that Violet enters the Scribe Quadrant Shell never be able to take a life Page seventy the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TWENTYFOUR I move to scoot up the bed so I can sit but the pain in my arm reminds me that there was a dagger in it a couple of hours ago Now its bandaged How many stitches Eleven on one side and nineteen on the other He arches a dark brow and leans forward bracing his elbows on his knees You turned oranges into a weapon Violence I wiggle to a sitting position and shrug I worked with what I had Seeing as it kept you alivekept us aliveI cant really argue and Im not going to ask how it is you always know who youll end up challenging Theres definite anger in that gaze but a touch of relief too Telling Ridoc allowed Emetterio to get him here in time Unfortunately hes five beds down from you and hell live unlike the secondyear a row over You could have killed him and saved us all a lot of drama I didnt want to kill him I roll my shoulder testing it Sore but not dislocated My face is tender too I just wanted him to stop killing me You should have told me The accusation rips from his lips in a snarl And you could have done nothing about it besides make me look weak I narrow my eyes at him And you havent exactly been around to talk about anything in weeks If I didnt know better Id think that kiss scared you Shit I didnt mean to say that Thats not up for discussion Something flashes in his eyes and is quickly replaced by a cool mask of indifference Seriously I should know better considering hes avoided it this long It was a mistake You and I are going to be stationed together for the rest of our lives never able to escape the other Getting involvedeven on a physical levelis a colossal blunder No point talking about it I barely keep from clutching at my chest to see if all my organs are where theyre supposed to be since it feels like he just eviscerated me with four sentences But he had been just as into it as I was I was there and there was no mistaking that kind ofenthusiasm But maybe it was the churam What if I want to talk about it Then feel free but it doesnt mean I have to be a part of the conversation Were both allowed our boundaries and this is one of mine The finality in his tone makes my stomach curdle Ill agree that keeping my distance didnt work out so well and if todays little stunt was about getting my attention then congratulations Its yours I dont know what youre talking about I swing my feet to the side of the bed I need my boots and to get the hell out of here before I make an even bigger fool of myself Apparently I cant trust Liam to report deadly situations or Rhiannon to train you on the mat seeing how easily Barlowe had you pinned so as of this moment Im taking over Taking over what My eyes narrow Everything when it comes to you The next day during what should be our flight hours if not for the howling subzero winds outside Xaden has me on the mat Fortunately he has his shirt on so Im not distracted by what I know is under it No hes not only wearing fighting leathers and boots hes strapped to the nines with what looks to be a dozen different daggers in a dozen different sheaths Is it absolutely toxic that Im attracted to this look on him Probably But one look and my temperature rises Leave your blades off the mat he instructs and nearly a dozen riders glance our way from other mats At least Liam has been given the time to go train himself a couple of mats over against Daina first Most of the squads are in here making use of the unexpected free time so thankfully everyone is busy training instead of watching us But youre armed I glance pointedly to his sheaths You either trust me or you dont He tilts his head to the side slightly exposing more of the rebellion relic curving up around his neck The same relic I caressed with my hand while he had me against the foundation wall more than a month ago Nope Not thinking about that But my body has no problem remembering I blow out my breath in a long sigh and step to the edge of the mat unsheathing every dagger I own and the ones Ive won then laying them on the floor Im unarmed Happy now I turn to face him putting my arms out My long sleeve covers the bandage on my arm but the throb is insistent Though we probably could have waited a couple of days for my arm to heal up before doing this The stitches pull but Ive had worse No He shakes his head unsheathing one of his daggers and walking forward The enemy doesnt give a shit if youre wounded Theyll use it to their advantage If you dont know how to fight in pain then youll get us both killed Fine I shift my body weight in annoyance Little does he know Im almost always in pain Its pretty much my comfort zone Thats actually a good point so Ill let you have it Thank you for being so gracious He smirks and I ignore the immediate surge of warmth low in my belly He flips his palm upward showing me the dagger with an oddly short blade The problem isnt necessarily your fighting style Youre fast and youve become pretty damned formidable since August The problem is youre using daggers that are too easy to pluck out of your hands You need weaponry designed for your body type At least he didnt say weaknesses I study the blade in his hand Its beautiful with a solid black hilt engraved with Tyrrish knots old mythical runes of intricate swirls and ties The blade itself is clearly honed to lethal perfection Its spectacular Its yours My head snaps up but theres no lie in his onyx eyes I had it made for you His lips curve slightly What My mouth opens and my chest tightens He took the time to have it made Shit That gives me feelings I really dont want to have Soft confusing feelings You heard me Take it Swallowing the illogical lump in my throat I take the blade from him It feels solid in my palm but is infinitely lighter than my other daggers Theres no strain on my wrist and my fingers comfortably wrap around the hilt making it much more secure than the knives Ive left on the floor Who made it I know someone In the quadrant My eyebrows shoot up Youd be surprised how resourceful you get after three years here A smirk tugs at the corner of his mouth and I openly stare before remembering where we are Its incredible I shake my head and hand it back to him But you know I cant take it The only weapons were allowed to have are the ones we earn Only challenges or weapons qualifications are acceptable Theres a crossbow I have my eye on that Im not quite expert at yet Exactly He smiles for a flash of a second before moving with a speed Ive never dreamed possible Hes even faster than Imogen as he sweeps my feet from under me with one strike taking me to the mat in a single move The ease with which he has me on my back is simultaneously appalling andridiculously hot especially with the weight of his hips settled between my thighs It takes all my willpower not to reach up and brush the stray lock of hair from his forehead It was a mistake Well if that memory doesnt cool me right off And what point are you making with this little move I ask well aware that hes done it all without knocking the wind out of me There are a dozen of these daggers strapped to my body so start disarming me He lifts a sardonic brow Unless you dont know how to handle an opponent on top of you and if so thats a whole other issue I know how to handle you on top of me I challenge quietly He lowers his mouth to my ear You wont like what happens if you push me Or maybe I will I turn just enough that my lips brush the shell of his ear He jerks up and the heat in his gaze makes me all too aware of everywhere our bodies connect Disarm me before I test that theory in front of everyone in this gym Interesting I didnt take you for an exhibitionist Keep pushing and I guess youll find out His gaze drops to my mouth I thought you said kissing me was a mistake I dont care if the entire quadrant is watching if that means hell kiss me again It was He smirks Im just teaching you that blades arent the only way to disarm an opponent Tell me Violence are you disarmed Arrogant ass I scoff and start plucking knives from their sheaths flinging them across the mat while he watches with impatient amusement Then I lock my legs around his hips and force a roll to the left putting Xaden on his back Willingly of coursetheres no way Im kneeling on top of him if he doesnt want it that waybut I throw a forearm against his collarbone with the pretense of pinning him anyway and proceed to steal the other daggers he has sheathed along his side And lastly I say with a smile leaning forward our heated bodies nearly flush as I snatch the dagger right out of his hand Thank you The final blade secure Xaden throws his palms to the mat and shoves with unnatural strength arching us straight back until my spine kisses the mat again Thats I suck in a breath the move shocking me to my toes and lodging him firmly between my thighs It takes everything I have not to arch up against him and see if he really thinks that kiss was a mistake Not fair to use your powers on the mat Magical Sexual Whatever Its all unfair Thats the other thing He jumps to his feet and offers his hand I take it my head rushing as I stand Not now Do not get dizzy now Emetterio doesnt allow powers in order to level the playing field when it comes to challenges But out there The field is anything but level and you need to learn to use whatever youve got I cant do much beside ground shield and move a piece of parchment I sheathe the new dagger then collect the others and do the same They really are lovely all marked with different runes Its a shame there are so many parts of Tyrrish culture that were lost centuries ago during the unification including most runes I dont even know what they all mean Well looks like were going to have to work on that too He sighs and takes up a fighting stance Now earn your nickname and try your best to kill me February flies by in a blur of exhaustion Xaden takes every unscheduled moment of my day and Dains gritted his teeth more than once when the wingleader has pulled me out of squad training because he has something infinitely more important for me to do Which usually ends with me getting my ass handed to me repeatedly on the mat But I have to say he doesnt baby me like Dain and he doesnt take it easy on me like Rhiannon does He pushes me to my physical limit every session but never further usually leaving me a boneless sweaty heap on the sparring gym floor gasping for breath Thats usually when Imogen reminds me that Im needed in the weight room I hate them both Kind of Its hard to argue with the results when Im learning to take down the strongest fighter in the quadrant I have yet to beat him but Im all right with that It means he doesnt let me win He also doesnt kiss me again even when I push March arrives with uncountable feet of snow that have to be shoveled before morning formation every day And the moments the relic burns in my back and I feel like I might crawl out of my own skin if the power building within me doesnt release reminds me that I still dont have a signet Its already almost been three months Every morning I wake up wondering if today is the day Ill spontaneously combust Sharla Gunter Captain Fitzgibbons reads from the death roll his gloved hands slipping on the frozen parchment Its warmer this week but not by much And Mushin Vedie We commend their souls to Malek Vedie I ask Rhiannon my eyebrows shooting up as formation ends I didnt know him well since he was in Second Wing but the name is still a shock considering he was rumored to be one of the best among us You didnt hear She pulls her furlined cloak closer around her neck His signet manifested in the middle of Carrs class yesterday and he burst into flames Heburned himself to death She nods Tara said Carr thinks he was supposed to be able to wield fire but it just overwhelmed him in that first rush and He went up like a torch Ridoc adds Kind of makes you glad your signets still hiding huh Hiding is one way to put it Other than the ability Im not supposed to even whisper about Im proving to be the one thing my mother hatesaverage And its not as though I can go to Tairn or Andarna for help The signet is all about me and Im apparently not delivering as the stinging relic on my back constantly reminds me Theres a tiny secret part of me that hopes my signet hasnt manifested yet because its different than the others not only useful butmeaningful like Brennans was Definitely makes me want to skip class today Rhiannon mutters blowing on her hands to keep them warm No skipping class Dain admonishes pinning us with a stare Were weeks away from the Squad Battle and we need every single one of you at your best to win Imogen snorts Come on Aetos I think we all know Second Wing has that squad in Tail Section thats going to smoke the rest of us Have you ever seen them sprint up the Gauntlet Pretty sure theyve been out there even though its still covered in ice Were going to win Cianna our executive officer proclaims with a decisive nod Sorrengail here might slow us down on the Gauntletshe wrinkles her hawkish noseand probably in the wielding department too at the rate shes advancing Gee thanks I fold my arms across my chest Bet I can shield better than all of them combined But Rhiannons skills more than make up for that Cianna continues And we all know Liam and Heaton are both going to decimate on the mat for the challenge competition That only leaves flight maneuvers and whatever task the wingleaders come up with to judge this year Oh is that all Man I thought it was going to be hard The sarcasm rolling off Ridoc is thick enough to earn him a glare from Dain Were down to ten of you Dain says glancing over our group Twelve of us in total which puts us at a slight disadvantage against a couple other squads but I think well manage We lost two of the new additions last week when the smaller ones signet manifested in Battle Brief and they both froze to death in seconds nearly taking out Ridoc with the exposure too He was treated for frostbite but didnt have any permanent damage Now Nadine and Liam are the only ones left from the batch we acquired after Threshing But in order to manage I need you guys to get to class He lifts his brows at me Especially you A signet would be great you know If you can maybe make that happen Its as if he cant decide how to treat me lately as the firstyear whos struggling but still here or the girl he grew up with I hate how unsettled everything feels between us all wrongly sticky like putting on clothes before you can dry after a bath but its still Dain At least hes finally being supportive Shes going to miss Carrs class today Xaden interrupts appearing behind Sawyer who hurries to clear a path No Im not I shake my head and ignore the quick jump of my pulse at the sight of him She needs to go Dain argues then grits his teeth I mean unless the wing has more pressing matters for Cadet Sorrengail her time is best spent developing her wielding skills I think we both know shes not going to manifest a signet in that room She would have already if that was the key I wouldnt wish the look Xaden levels Dain with on my worst enemy Its not anger or even indignation No he looksannoyed as if Dains complaints are entirely beneath him which according to our chain of command they are And yes the wing has more pressing matters for her Sir Im just not comfortable with her going a day without at least practicing her wielding and as her squad leader He doesnt know that Xadens been giving me extra wielding sessions while we spar For Dunnes sake Xaden sighs invoking the goddess of war He reaches into the pocket of his cloak and takes out a pocket watch holding it in his outstretched palm Pick it up Sorrengail I glance at the two men and wish theyd just sort their shit out between themselves but theres about a zero percent chance of that happening For the sake of expediency I throw my mental feet into the floor of the Archives Whitehot power flows around me raising goose bumps on my arms and lifting the hair at the back of my neck Raising my right hand I envision that power twining between my fingers and little shocks blossom along my skin as I give form to the energy making it a hand of its own as I ask it to stretch the few feet that separate me from Xaden Theres an abrupt halt as though my tendrils of raw magic hit a wall but then it gives and I push forward keeping tight control of the blazing hand Theres a crackle in my head like the dying embers of a fire as my power brushes Xadens hand but I close my mental fist around the pocket watch and then pull Its fucking heavy You got this Rhiannon urges Let her concentrate Sawyer chides The watch plummets for the ground but I snap my hand back yanking on my power as though its a rope and the watch flies toward me I catch it with my left hand before it can smack me in the face Rhiannon and Ridoc clap Xaden walks forward and plucks the watch from my fingers dropping it into his cloak See Shes practiced Now we have things to do He puts his hand on the small of my back and leads me out of the crowd Where are we going I loathe the way my body demands I lean back into his touch but I miss it the second its gone Im assuming youre not wearing flight leathers under that cloak He opens the door to the dormitory for me and I walk inside The motion is so easy that I know its not only practiced but second nature which is at complete odds with welleverything Ive come to know about him I pause looking at him like were meeting for the first time What he asks closing the door behind us and shutting out the blustering cold You opened the door for me Old habits die hard He shrugs My father taught me that His voice dies abruptly and his gaze falls away every muscle in his body locking as though hes preparing for an attack My heart aches at the look that crosses his face recognizing it well Grief Dont you think its a little cold for flying I ask changing the subject in an attempt to help The pain in his eyes is the kind that never dies the kind that rises like an unpredictable tide and floods the shoreline without mercy He blinks and its gone Ill wait here I nod and hurry to change into the furlined leathers were issued for winter flight He has that unreadable mask on when I return and I know there wont be any more doors held on my account today We walk out across the emptying courtyard as cadets scurry off to classes You didnt answer me About what He keeps his eyes on the gate to the flight field path and I have to damn near scurry to keep up with his strides About it being cold for flight Thirdyears have flight field this afternoon Kaori and the other professors are just taking it easy on you guys since the Squad Battle is coming up and they know you need the practice in wielding He pushes open the gate and I hurry after him But I dont need the practice My voice echoes in the tunnel Winning the Squad Battle is nothing in the scheme of keeping you alive Youll be on the front lines before the rest of them come next year The mage lights play off the harsh angles of his face casting sinister shadows as we pass each one Is that whats going to happen next year I ask as we come out the other side the snow whiting out my vision momentarily Its piled high on each side of the path the result of this heavy winter Im going to the front lines Inevitably Theres no telling how long Sgaeyl and Tairn will tolerate being separated My best guess is that well both have to sacrifice to keep them happy Hes clearly not so happy about it himself but I cant blame him After three years in the quadrant Id want to get the hell out too My stomach sinks as I realize Ill be in his shoes when I graduate as well with no real control on how our dragons bond dictates my future posts I nod not knowing what else to say and we walk to the Gauntlet in companionable silence Second Wing I note watching the squad from Tail Section slip and slide their way across the Gauntlet You sure you dont want your own squads out here practicing A corner of his mouth lifts and that inhuman facade of his cracks When I was a firstyear I thought winning was the pinnacle too But once youre in your third year and you see the things that we do His jaw flexes Lets just say that the games are a lot more lethal We head toward the staircase that leads to the flight field but theres already a group coming down so I move back to let them descend first My heart launches into my throat as they come closer and I snap my frame to an attention stance my spine stiffening Its Commandant Panchek and Colonel Aetos Reaching the ground first Dains dad offers me a smile At ease Youre looking well Violet Nice flight lines he says gesturing to the ones on his own cheekbones that come from flight goggles You must be getting a lot of airtime Thank you sir I am I relax my posture and cant help but return the favor but my lips are tight Dain is doing well too Hes my squad leader this year Hes told me He grins his brown eyes just as warm as Dains Mira asked about you while we were touring the Southern Wing last month Dont worry youll get your letter privileges in second year and then you can keep in touch more often Im sure you miss her Every day I nod pushing past the swell of emotion the admission brings Its so much easier to pretend theres nothing outside the walls than to wallow in how much I miss my sister Xaden stiffens at my side as Mom steps out of the stairwell Oh shit Mom I blurt and her head turns her eyes meeting mine Its been more than five months since Ive seen her and even though I want to be as composed as she is as compartmentalized I just cant Im not built like she is like Mira is Im my fathers daughter Her assessing gaze sweeps over me with all the familiarity of a commanding general and a Basgiath cadet and theres no warmth in her expression as she finishes her perusal I hear youre having trouble wielding I blink and step backward as though physical distance is going to shelter me from the icy rebuke I have the best shields in my year For the first time Im actually glad I havent manifested a signet havent given her something to brag about With a dragon like Tairn I would certainly hope so She cocks an eyebrow If not all of that incredible enviable power will have been Her sigh is a puff of steam in the air Squandered I try my best to swallow the growing knot in my throat Yes General You have been the topic of some conversation though Her gaze skims the top of my head and I know shes looking at the silvertipped braid she thinks marks me as cursed the hair she told me I was better off cutting Oh She actually talks about me Were all wondering what powersif anyyoure wielding from the golden dragon Her lips form a smile Im sure she thinks is soft but I know her too well to fall for it No The single word from Tairn rumbles through my entire body Do not speak of it Nothing yet I drag my tongue over my chapped lower lip Winter is hell on the skin during flight Andarna told me that feathertails are known for being unable to channel power to their rider Only their direct gifts but Im not about to say that Its why they dont bond often Or ever Dains dad chimes in We were actually hoping that you might ask your dragon to allow us to study her For purely academic purposes of course My stomach sours The group of them would poke and prod Andarna for gods know how long to appease their academic curiosity and they might stumble onto the untapped power of young dragons No thank you Unfortunately I dont see her being comfortable with that Shes pretty private even with me Pity Colonel Aetos says Weve had the scribes on it since Threshing and the only reference they can find in the Archives about the power of feathertails is hundreds of years old which is funny because I remember your father doing a bit of research about the second Krovlan uprising and he mentioned something about feathertails but we cant seem to find that tome He scratches his forehead Mom looks at me with expectation as though to ask me without actually asking I dont believe he finished his research on that particular historical event before he died Colonel Aetos I couldnt even tell you where his notes are The words are as true as I can make them I know exactly where his notes arein the one location he spent the majority of his afterhours time But theres something about Tairns warning that makes me simply unable to tell them Too bad Mom forces another smile Glad to see youre alive Cadet Sorrengail Her gaze flashes sideways and instantly hardens to steel Even if the company youre forced to keep is more than questionable Shit Shit Shit I cant step in front of Xaden and make him look weak I cant even glance his way without telling my mother where my allegiance lieswithout telling myself I always felt that we resolved any of those questions years ago Xaden says his voice low but hes gone taut as a bowstring next to me Hmm Mom turns toward the citadel in clear dismissal Do see if you can master some kind of signet Cadet Sorrengail You have a legacy to live up to Yes General The informal words cost more than Im prepared to admit ripping into the confidence its taken me nearly eight months to build with talonsharp precision Good to see you Violet Dains dad offers me a sympathetic smile and Panchek outright ignores us running to catch up with Mom I dont say a word to Xaden before I climb the stairs each step making me only angrier until Im a ball of rage by the time I reach the top of the cliffside You didnt tell her about how you got out of the attack in your bedroom he says Its a statement not a question And Im not talking about me showing up I know exactly what hes talking about I dont ever see her And you told me not to tell anyone Didnt realize it was quite like that between you Xaden says his tone surprisingly soft as we start down the box canyon toward the flight field Oh thats nothing I toss out intentionally making my tone as flippant as possible She spent almost an entire year ignoring me when Dad died A selfdeprecating laugh slips past my lips Which was almost as wholesome as the years she spent barely tolerating my existence because I wasnt perfect like Brennan or a warrior like Mira I shouldnt be saying these things These are the thoughts families keep behind their doors so they can wear their polished perfect reputations like armor when in public She doesnt know you very well then Xaden remarks keeping pace with my furious strides I scoff Or she sees right through me Problem is Im never quite sure which it is Im too busy trying to live up to whatever impossible standard she sets to ask myself if theyre even standards I give a shit about My narrowed gaze swings to him And what was that about anyway Saying that you resolved questions years ago Just reminding her that I paid the price for my loyalty His brow furrows but he stares ahead of us Paid what price The question slips out before I can stop my foolish tongue I cant help but remember what Dain said that Xaden has reasons to never forgive my mother Boundaries Violence His head lowers for the span of a heartbeat and when it rises hes wearing that polished givenofucks mask hes so good at donning Lucky for us the strain of the moment is broken as Tairn and Sgaeyl land across the field ahead accompanied by a shiny smaller dragon who makes me instantly smile Were all flying today I ask following as he walks toward the trio Were all learning today You need to learn how to stay on and I need to learn why the hell its so hard for you he answers Andarna needs to learn how to keep up Tairn needs to learn how to share his space in a tighter flight formation and every other dragon but Sgaeyl is too scared to fly closer Tairn chuffs in agreement as we approach And what is Sgaeyl learning I ask eyeing the giant blue dragon Xaden grins Shes been leading for almost three years now Shes going to have to learn how to follow Or at least practice Tairns chuff sounds suspiciously like a laugh and she snaps at him baring her teeth and coming within inches of his neck Dragon relationships are absolutely incomprehensible I murmur Yeah You should try a human one sometime Just as vicious but less fire He mounts with an ease I envy Now lets go The Squad Battle is more important than the wingleaders will let on They like to joke that its a game that its just bragging rights for the squad leaders and the winning squad but its not Theyre all watching The commandant the professors the commanding officerstheyre watching to see who will rise to the top Theyre salivating to see who will fall Page seventyseven the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TWENTYFIVE Tap out Rhiannon screams as a rider out of Second Wing fights to drag himself forward on the mat his hands splayed wide his fingernails digging in as Liam holds him in a leg lock forcing his back into what should be an impossible arch My heart pounds as the excitement of todays matches reaches a fever pitch Its the last challenge of this portion of the Squad Battle and the crowd pushes at our backs forcing me to continuously struggle not to fall over onto the mat After two events were in seventh out of twentyfour on the leaderboard but if Liam wins well jump to third My flight time in the gauntlet sky race was the slowest in squad but thats because I kept forcing Tairn to release his magical hold on meand then wed lose precious seconds while he had to dip to catch me and toss me back in the saddle Over and over and over again I swear the bruises on my ass from landing in the hard divot hurt less than Tairns scoff that Id humiliated his entire family line as we crossed the finish line last Mikael cries out in pain the sound sharp near earsplitting and pulling my attention back to the action in front of me Liam holds fast and presses his advantage Fuck me that looks like it hurts I mutter over the cheering firstyears Yeah hes not walking for a while Ridoc agrees cringing as the arc of Mikaels back looks like a broken spine waiting to happen With another cry Mikael slams his palm into the mat three times and the crowd roars Yes Go Liam Sawyer screams from behind me and Liam drops Mikael to the mat where he sprawls out exhausted We won Liam rushes for us and Im swept up into a tangle of arms and shouting and joyous squadmates Im pretty sure I even see Imogen in this little melee But I dont see Dain Where the hell is Dain He would never miss this Your winner Professor Emetterio shouts his voice ringing through the gym and quieting the zealous energy as Liam steps out of our crushing hug Liam Mairi from Second Squad Flame Section Fourth Wing Liam puts up both hands in victory and turns in a small circle and the sound of cheering makes my ears ring in the best way Commandant Panchek steps onto the mat and Liam joins the rest of our squad sweat pouring off his skin I know you were all expecting the last portion of the Squad Battle to happen tomorrow but the cadre and I have a surprise He has every single riders attention now Instead of telling you what the final unknown task will be and giving you tonight to plan for it your final task will begin this hour He grins throwing out his hands and turning just like Liam had Tonight Ridoc whispers My stomach hits the ground Dain isnt here Neither is Cianna Oh shit Imogen whispers looking over the crowd herself As you may have noticed your squad leaders and their executive officers have beenshall we say sequestered with your section leaders and wingleaders and no before someone asks your task is not to find them He continues to walk in a small circle addressing each side of the mat You are to break into your squads and accomplish a unique mission this evening without the leadership and instruction of your squad leaders Doesnt that defeat the purpose of having squad leaders someone asks across the mat The purpose of a squad leader is to form a tightly knit unit that can carry on with a mission after their demise Consider your leadersdemised Panchek shrugs with a gleeful smile Youre on your own riders Your mission is simple find and acquire by any means necessary the one thing that would be most advantageous to our enemies regarding the war effort Leadership will serve as unbiased judges and the winning squad will be awarded sixty points Thats enough to put us into first Rhiannon whispers linking her arm with mine We could win the glory of going to the front What are the boundaries someone to the right asks Anything within the walls of Basgiath Panchek answers And dont you dare let me see you trying to haul a dragon back here Theyll incinerate you out of sheer annoyance The squad to our left mutters their disappointment You havePanchek pulls out his pocket watchthree hours at which time well expect you to present your stolen treasures in the Battle Brief room We all stare at him in silence Out of everything I imagined the third and final task to bewell this wasnt anywhere near that list What are you waiting for Panchek shoos his hands at us Go Pandemonium ensues This is what happens when you remove our leadership Werea hot freaking mess Second Squad Imogen yells putting her hands up Follow me Sawyer and Heaton make sure were all ducklings following in Imogens wake as she leads us across the gym to the weight room You did great I tell Liam as he walks at my side still struggling to catch his breath It was epic Ridoc hands Liam a waterskin which Liam promptly drains Lets go lets go Imogen says ushering us through the open door She does a quick head count and then closes the door wielding to lock it I find a seat on one of the benches flanked by Rhiannon and Liam First thing Who wants to be in command Imogen asks looking at the ten of us Ridoc throws his hand in the air Rhiannon turns and forces it back down No She shakes her head Youll turn this into some kind of prank Fair point He shrugs Liam Quinn asks lifting her eyebrows No He shakes his head but his gaze darts in my direction giving his reasoning away No one is going to try and off me while were out tonight I argue He turns back toward Imogen and shakes his head one more time Of course she nods Theyre both on Team Xaden You keep command Rhiannon suggests looking at Imogen Youve gotten us this far A murmur of agreement goes around the room Emery Heaton Imogen asks As thirdyears its your right No thanks Heaton leans back against the wall Nope Theres a reason neither of us wanted to be in leadership Emery adds sitting next to Nadine Any reason you wouldnt be all right following Imogens command for a few hours Nadine Every one of us turns to face the firstyear who hasnt been remotely subtle about her hatred of marked ones Knowing now that shes from a northern village on the border of the provinces of Deaconshire and Tyrrendor I can see her reasoning I just dont agree with it hence why Im not exactly friendly with her She visibly swallows her nervous gaze skittering over all of us Im fine with it Good Imogen folds her arms across her chest the wrist with her rebellion relic peeking out from under her tunic We have a little less than three hours What are your ideas What about a piece of weaponry Ridoc suggests A crossbolt would be deadly to any of our dragons in the hands of our enemies Too big Quinn says decisively Theres only one in the museum and honestly its not even the bolt thats deadly its the launching system Next Imogen glances at each of us We could steal Pancheks underw Ridoc starts before Rhiannon slams her hand over his mouth And thats why we dont let you lead She arches a brow at him Come on guys Think Whats the most useful thing to our enemy Imogens brow puckers over her pale green eyes Information Liam answers He swings his gaze toward me Violet what about stealing the news missives from the Archives The ones that come in from the front I shake my head Its after seven The Archives are locked and its the kind of vault that even wielding isnt going to touch The whole room is sealed up airtight in case of fire Damn Imogen sighs That was a good one The entire room breaks into conversation each voice louder than the next as suggestions are hurled into the open Information My stomach twists as an idea takes form It would be a showstopper something no one else could compare to But I shake my head Its too risky What are you thinking Sorrengail Imogen asks and the room falls silent I can see the little gears turning in your mind Its probably nothing I glance at the members of our squad But is it nothing Get up here and work it out in your head Imogen orders Seriously its mad Like undoable Wed get thrown in the brig if were caught I snap my mouth shut before I say anything more But its too lateImogens eyes are sparkling with interest Get Up Here And Work It Out she orders making sure I know its not a suggestion We can wield right I stand brushing my hands down my sides and the hilts of the six daggers sheathed there By all means necessary Heaton repeats nodding All right I rock back on my heels letting my mind whirl through a plan I know Ridoc can wield ice Rhiannon can retrieve Sawyer can manipulate metal Imogen can mindwipe recent memories And Im fast she adds Something she has in common with Xaden Heaton what about you I ask I can breathe underwater they answer I blink Awesome but I dont think thats going to come in handy if we do this Emery I can control wind He grins A lot of wind All right that one could be defensively useful but not quite what Im looking for My boots squeak on the floor as I turn to face her Quinn I can astral project Keep my body in one place and then walk around somewhere else My mouth hangs open matching about half the squad I know its pretty awesome She winks pulling her curls up into a bun Yes That we can use My head bobs as I parcel through the easiest way to do this What are you thinking Sorrengail Imogen prompts tucking the short hair on one side of her shaved head behind her ear Youre going to tell me Ive lost my mind but if we pull it off well win for sure I might not be enough like my mother to win her approval but I know where she keeps the most valuable information And Were going to break into my mothers office You are so fucking creepy Ridoc squirms two hours later leaning away from Quinn well from Quinns astral form Her body is currently with Heaton guarded in the weight room The rest of us are sneaking through the hallways past the Healer Quadrant Weve already run into a squad from Second and another from Third but none of us had time to question or deter the others Well rise or fall on our own merit with this timeline and weve wasted the last two hours waiting for night to fall so it would even be possible Ive never been farther than this Emery says as we pass the last door to the clinic Youve never even been to the Archives Imogen asks I avoid that duty like the plague Emery answers Scribes freak me out Quiet little knowitalls acting like they can make or break someone by writing something down I grin Theres more truth to that statement than most people realize Infantry is still out camping Rhiannon points out the windows to the dozens of campfires illuminating the field below Must be nice to get a break Nadine remarks but theres no snotty tone Ive come to expect just the same exhaustion I think we all feel Scribes will all go home for the summer Healers get to spend their weekends on those mindbodyhealth retreats and the infantry might have to practice making and breaking camp in the snow through winter but at least they spend those months around a campfire Well get to go home Imogen argues After graduation Rhiannon retorts For what A couple of days We come to a fork in the path where we can follow the tunnel down to the Archives or climb into the fortress of the war college Theres no turning back from here I say to the group looking up the spiral staircase Ive climbed so many times that I know each step by heart Lead on Quinn orders and we all jump about a foot in the air Shhh Imogen hisses Some of us can get caught you know Right Sorry Quinn cringes Everyone remember the plan I whisper No one deviates No one They all nod and we begin our silent climb up the dark stairs then cling to the shadows as we cross the stone courtyard of Basgiath Sure could use Xaden right about now Youre doing great Andarna assures me in the happiest of tones I swear nothing bothers her Shes the most fearless kid Ive ever met and I grew up with Mira Its six flights straight up I whisper when we reach the next set of stairs and we continue to climb as fast as we can without making any noise Anxiety spikes and my power rises in response the relic in my back heating to an uncomfortable burn Its always there lately simmering beneath my skin reminding me that performing lesser magics isnt going to be enough to vent it if I dont manifest a signet soon Eventually we reach the top of the steps and Liam leans out just far enough to see down the length of whats always felt like the worlds longest hallway There are mage lights in sconces he whispers And you were right He withdraws into the safety of the stairwell Theres only one guard stationed at the door Was there any light under the door I ask quietly My heart sounds like its loud enough for the whole college to hear even the infantry cadets sleeping hundreds of feet below us No He turns to Quinn The guard looks about six feet tall but he seems pretty athletic The other stairwell is down the hallway to the left which means youll have to get his attention and then book it Quinn nods No problem Everyone else know what theyre doing I ask There are eight nods Then lets do this Quinn youre up Everyone else circle back down so he cant see us if he looks this way I cant believe were actually about to do this If she catches us there wont be any mercy Its not in her nature We retreat and Quinn charges up the stairs Her voice is muffled by the stone walls but we hear the guards pounding footsteps clear as day as he charges past the stairway Get back here You cant be here Now Imogen orders We launch leaving Rhiannon and Emery in the stairwell as we fly into the hallway Sawyer rushes toward the opposite staircase throwing the door shut and twisting the metal joints with his powers as we bolt down the hall Ive never run this fast in my life and Nadine is already at the door trying to unweave whatever wards my mother has used Liam steps into the spot where the guard stood and lifts his chin in the air taking the same posture Are you all right Yep I answer my chest heaving as Imogen steps in to help Nadine Nadines signet is the ability to unweave wards which I never thought would come in this handy Riders are always out there building the wards keeping the shields up around Navarre Then again not many riders try to break into the commanding generals office And Ill be fine in there I assure him a smile tugging at my lips Which is funny since I didnt think the same way the last time I was standing here Got it Nadine whispers nudging the door open If you hear me whistle Liam starts worry lining his forehead Well go out the window or something I assure him as Ridoc and Sawyer rush past Relax Leaving Liam to stand watch I join the others in Moms office Dont touch the mage lights or shell know I warn them You have to make your own I flick my wrist twisting my power into a bright blue flame and letting it drift over me Its one of the things Im actually good at How nice is this Ridoc flops down onto the red couch We dont have time for you to beyou Sawyer lectures heading for the bookcase Help me search for something useful Well take the table Imogen and Nadine start sorting through papers on the sixseater conference table Which leaves me and the desk I mutter walking around the intimidating piece of furniture and praying I dont trigger any wards shes set There are three folded missives in the middle and I pick up the first revealing a sharp dagger with an alloyinfused hilt and what looks to be a Tyrrish rune in the handle that she must be using as a letter opener or something I unfold the letter with as much care as I can General Sorrengail The raids around Athebyne have spread the wing too thin Being posted beyond the safety of the wards comes with considerable hazards and though I am loath to request reinforcements I must If we do not reinforce the post we may be forced to abandon it We are protecting Navarrian citizens with life limb and wing but I can not adequately relay how dire the situation is here I know you receive the dailies from our scribe attachment but I would be remiss in my duties as executive officer of the Southern Wing if I did not write to you personally Please find us reinforcements Sincerely Major Kallista Neema I breathe past the ache that erupts in my chest at the plea in her letter Weve discussed nearly daily attacks in Battle Brief but nothing on that scale Maybe they dont want to scare us But if its that terrifying out there we have every right to knowwell likely be called into service before we graduate Maybe even this year These are allnumbers Imogen says rifling through the conference table papers Its April I say reaching for the next missive Shes working on next years budget Everyone stops and turns to look at me all wearing expressions of varying degrees of disbelief What I shrug Did you think this place ran itself Keep looking Imogen orders I unfold the next missive General Sorrengail Protests regarding conscription laws are growing within the province of Tyrrendor Knowing that due to Tyrrendors size it provides the majority of our conscripts to replenish our front lines we can not afford to lose the support of the people again Perhaps an influx of defensive spending on outposts here would not only bolster the provinces economy and remind the Tyrrish how needed they are to the defense of our kingdom but also ease the unrest Please consider this solution as an alternative to suppressing the unrest with force Sincerely Lieutenant Colonel Alyssa Travonte What the hell I close the letter and put it back on Moms desk then turn to the giant map hanging on the wall directly above me Unrest isnt new to Tyrrendor nor is the sentiment against conscription but we certainly havent heard any political rumblings in Battle Brief Other than to quell discontent it would make no sense to increase defensive spending there especially since it holds our fewest number of outposts due to the natural barrier provided by the Cliffs of Dralor which are unscalable by gryphons Tyrrendor should already be one of the safest provinces on the Continent Well except Aretia Where that capital should be there is only a scorch mark as though the burning of the city has singed the map as well I study the map for precious seconds noting the battlement markers dotted along the countryside Logically there are more outposts along our more active border zones and according to this map more troops in those locations It shows all of Navarre Krovla to the south Braevick and Cygnisen to the southeast and even the barriers of the Barrens the ruined deserted lands at the southern tip of the Continent It also shows each of our outposts and supply routes within Navarre A slow grin spreads across my face Hey Second Squad I know what we need to steal It takes a matter of minutes for us to haul the map down and cut it away from its frame then another to roll it securing it with leather ties Imogen pulls out of her satchel Liam whistles and my heart nearly leaps out of my chest Shit Ridoc races to the door and cracks it open as we all prepare to flee Whats going on out there Hes pounding at the hall door Its going to give any second We have to go now Liam whispershouts holding the door open as we all race into the hallway The map is too big for one person to carry and Sawyer and Imogen struggle through the doorway as the guard kicks in the door farther down the hall My stomach hits the floor and panic threatens to overwhelm logical thought And were fucked Nadine announces What the hell do you think youre doing the guard shouts charging toward us Were dead if he catches us with the map Ridoc bounces on his toes like hes preparing to fight On any given day Id argue that riders are the superior fighterswe have to bebut that Basgiath guard might just give us a run for our money We cant hurt him I protest The guard barrels past the first stairwell and Rhiannon steps into the middle of the hallway her arms outstretched Please work Please work Please work Imogen chants The map disappears out of her hands and reappears down the hallway in Rhiannons I barely have time to register that it worked as the guard stumbles but he keeps running Any closer and hell see my face This was not part of the plan Liam moves to my side Adapt Emery Imogen hisses and the thirdyear steps to the front of our little raiding party Im so sorry man He holds out his hands and pushes A torrent of air rushes down the hallway ripping tapestries from the walls and knocking into the guard sending him flying against the stone wall Run We sprint down the hall toward where the guard lies limp Put him in here I hiss forcing open the next door the one that belongs to one of my mothers undersecretaries Liam and Ridoc haul the guard in and I put my fingers to his neck Good strong pulse He just knocked him out Open his mouth I snag the vial hidden in the pocket of my leathers uncork it and then let the tonic flow into the guards mouth Hell sleep the rest of the night Liams wide eyes meet mine Youre kind of terrifying Thank you I grin and we get out of there running as fast as we can Fifteen minutes later our chests are still heaving as we skid into the Battle Brief room just under the clock Were the last to arrive and the tick of Dains jaw from where he sits in the top row with the other leadership tells me were going to get an earful about it I drag my gaze away and we find our seats as presentations begin in order of squad giving us enough time to recover from our sprinting session before we have to take the stage A squad in First Wing stole Kaoris handwritten manual on the personal habits and flaws of all active dragons Impressive A squad in Second Wing elicits an appreciative murmur when they reveal the uniform of one of the Infantry professors fully intact with something riders never beara name tag That would grant any enemy access to our outposts given the rank on the shoulder Third Wings best offering is a stunned wideeyed scribe stolen straight from his bed and given the way his mouth isnt moving Yep someones signet power takes away speech The poor thing is going to be traumatized when they finally let him go When its our turn to take the stage Sawyer and Liam the two tallest in our squad hold the top corners of our map so its visible to all as it unrolls I stand back next to Imogen and search the leadership for a certain pair of onyx eyes There he is Xaden is leaning against the wall near the other wingleaders watching me with a pulsequickening mix of curiosity and expectation It was your idea Imogen whispers nudging me forward Present Markhams eyes flare wide as saucers as he forces himself to stand followed quickly by Devera whose mouth hangs so wide its almost comical I clear my throat and gesture to the map We have brought the ultimate weapon for our enemies An uptodate map of all current outposts of Navarrian wings to include troop strength of infantry battlements I point to the forts along the Cygnisen border As well as the locations of all current skirmishes in the last thirty days Including last night A murmur rips through the quadrant And how do we know this map is in fact current Kaori asks holding his reclaimed journal under one arm Theres no stopping the smile that spreads across my face Because we stole it from General Sorrengails office Absolute mayhem breaks out some of the riders rushing the stage as professors battle their way toward us but I ignore it all as Xaden tilts one corner of that beautiful mouth and tips an imaginary hat to me bowing his head for a heartbeat before bringing his gaze back to hold mine Satisfaction fills every ounce of my being as I smile up at him It doesnt matter how the vote comes down Ive already won There is no stronger bond than that between two mated dragons It goes beyond the depth of human love or adoration to a primal undeniable requirement for proximity One can not survive without the other Colonel Kaoris Field Guide to Dragonkind CHAPTER TWENTYSIX Flying for short distances is something I manage Flight maneuversthe dips and dives that come with combat formationssend me spinning through the sky unless Tairn holds me on with bands of his own power But flying for six hours straight for our prize a weeklong tour of a forward outpost might just be the death of me Im pretty sure Im dying Nadine bends over bracing her hands on her knees I feel that Every vertebra in my spine screams as I stretch and the hands that were freezing only a few minutes ago start to sweat inside my leather gloves Naturally Dain is minimally affected his posture only slightly stiff as he and Professor Devera greet a tall man in rider black who I assume is the outpost commander Welcome cadets the commander says with a professional smile folding his arms across the chest of his lightweight leathers His saltandpepper hair makes it hard to determine his age and he has that gaunt weathered look all riders get when theyve been stationed on the border for too long Im sure youd all like to get settled and into something a little more appropriate to the climate Then well show you around Montserrat Rhiannon inhales sharply her gaze sweeping over the mountains You all right She nods Later Later arrives in exactly twelve sweatsoaked minutes as were shown to our doubleoccupancy barracks rooms Theyre sparse only furnished with two beds two wardrobes and a single desk under a wide window Shes quiet the entire time we make our way through the bathing chamber to wash off the ride and alarmingly silent while we dress in our summer leathers It may only be April here at Montserrat but it feels like Basgiath in June You going to tell me whats up I ask stowing my pack beneath the bed before making sure all my daggers are where theyre supposed to be The hilts are barely visible in the sheaths I wear at my thighs but I doubt many people this far east would recognize the Tyrrish symbols Rhiannons hands tremble with what looks like nervous energy as she straps her sword to her back Do you know where we are I mentally bring up a map Were about two hundred miles from the coast My village is less than an hour away on foot Her eyes meet mine in an unspoken plea so much emotion swirling in their darkbrown depths that my throat clogs choking my words Taking her hands in mine I squeeze nodding I know exactly what shes asking and exactly what it will cost if were caught Dont tell anyone I whisper even though its just us in the tiny room We have six days to figure it out and we will Its a promise and we both know it Someone pounds on our door Lets go Second Squad Dain Nine months ago I would have relished this time away with him Now I find myself avoiding his constant expectations of meor just avoiding him in general Funny how much can change in such a short time We join the others and Major Quade gives us the grand tour of the outpost My stomach growls but I ignore it taking in the hectic energy of the base The fortress is basically four massive walls filled with barracks and various chambers with turrets on each corner and a large arched entrance that boasts a spiked portcullis that looks ready to drop at any second On one end of the courtyard theres a stable with a blacksmith and armory for the company of infantry stationed here and on the other is the dining hall As you can see Major Quade tells us as we stand in the middle of the muddy courtyard were built for siege In the event of attack we can feed and house everyone within for an adequate amount of time Adequate Ridoc mouths lifting his brows I press my lips together to keep from laughing and Dain gives him a look that promises retribution from where he stands beside me My smile falls away As one of the eastern outposts we have a full twelve riders stationed here Three are out on patrol now three wait standing by in case theyre needed and the other six are in various stages of rest Quade continues What is that look for Dain whispers What look I ask as the distinct roar of a dragon echoes off the stone walls That should be one of our patrols returning now Quade says smiling like he wants to mean it but cant quite find the energy The one where someone just sucked the joy out of your world Dain responds bending his head slightly and keeping his voice low enough that only I can hear him I could lie to him but that would make our semitruce even more awkward I was just remembering the guy I used to climb trees with thats all He startles like Ive slapped him So well get you riders fed and put to bed and then well work on who youll be shadowing while youre here Quade continues Will we get to participate in any active scenarios Heaton asks practically vibrating with excitement Absolutely not Devera snaps If you see combat then Ive failed as this being the safest place on the border to send you Quade answers But you get bonus points for enthusiasm Let me guess Thirdyear Heaton nods Quade turns slightly and smiles at three indistinct figures in rider black as they walk under the portcullis There they are now Why dont you three come and meet Violet My head whips toward the gate and my heart combusts in a series of erratic beats that leaves me clutching my chest with the best kind of shock No way Theres no way I stumble for the gate forgetting to be stoic to be emotionally untouchable as she breaks into a run her arms opening just before we collide She sweeps me up yanking me against her chest and squeezing tight She smells like dirt and dragon and the coppery tang of blood but I dont care I hug her back just as hard Mira I bury my face against her shoulder and my eyes burn as she rests her hand on top of the very braid she taught me how to do Its as if the weight of everything thats happened over the last nine months comes crashing down slamming into me with the force of a crossbolt The wind of the parapet The look in Xadens eyes when he realized I was a Sorrengail The sound of Jack swearing hed kill me The smell of burning flesh that first day The look on Aurelies face when she fell from the Gauntlet Pryor and Luca and Trina andTynan Oren and Amber Mavis Tairn and Andarna choosing me Xaden kissing me Our mother ignoring me Mira pulls me back just long enough to look me over as if shes checking for damage Youre all right She nods her teeth digging into her bottom lip Youre all right arent you I nod but she blurs in my vision because I might be alive thriving even but Im not the same person she left at the base of that turret and from the heaviness in her eyes she knows it too Yeah she whispers tucking me in tight again Youre all right Violet Youre all right If she says it enough times I might start to believe her Are you I jerk back to study her Theres a new scar that stretches from her earlobe to her collarbone Gods Mira Im fine she promises then grins And look at you You didnt die Irrational giddy laughter bubbles up I didnt die Youre not an only child We both burst into laughter and tears track down my cheeks Sorrengails are weird I hear Imogen state You have no idea Dain answers but when I turn to look his lips are curved into the first genuine smile Ive seen from him in months Shut up Aetos Mira barks throwing her arm over my shoulder Catch me up on everything Violet We might be hundreds of miles from Basgiath but Ive never felt more at home Its early evening two days later just after dinner when Rhiannon and I climb out our firststory window and drop to the ground Miras out on patrol and as wonderful as its been to have her close this is our only chance Were on our way Dont get caught Tairn warns Trying not to Rhiannon and I sneak along the battlement wall turning the corner toward the field I run into Mira so hard that I bounce backward Shit Rhiannon exclaims as she catches me Dont you at least check the corners Mira lectures folding her arms over her chest and staring me down in a way I might deserve Fine I definitely deserve In my defense I didnt think youd be there I say slowly Because youre supposed to be on patrol You were acting super weird at dinner She tilts her head to the side and studies me just like were kids again seeing way too much So I switched shifts Do you want to tell me what youre doing outside the walls I glance at Rhiannon and she looks away Neither of you Really She sighs and rubs the bridge of her nose You two need to sneak out of a heavily fortified defensive position because I look up at Rhiannon Shes going to figure it out anyway Shes like a bloodhound with stuff like this Trust me My stomach clenches Rhiannon tilts her chin Were flying to my familys house Mira blanches You think youre what Were flying to her village Its like a fiveminute flight according to Tairn and I start Absolutely not Mira shakes her head Nope You can not fly off like youre on vacation What if something happens to you At her parents house I ask slowly Because theres some major ambush planned on the off chance that we might just be dropping in Miras eyes narrow Shit This is not going well and given the death grip Rhiannon has on my arm now she doesnt think so either Wed be in less danger visiting her parents than we are at Basgiath I argue Miras lips purse Fair point Come with us I blurt Seriously Come with us Mira She just wants to see her sister Miras shoulders dip Shes softening and I mercilessly go in for the kill Raegan was pregnant when Rhiannon left Can you imagine not being there with me if I had a kid Wouldnt you do anything including escape a heavily fortified defensive position if that meant holding your niece or nephew My nose scrunches as I brace for her answer Besides with the hero of Strythmore at our side what could possibly go wrong Dont even start with that She looks at me then Rhiannon then back at me again before groaning Oh fucking fine Her finger comes out swinging when we both grin But if you even think about telling anyone Ill make you regret it for the rest of your natural life She means it I whisper I believe it Rhiannon answers Youre here two days and already breaking the rules Mira mutters Come on its quicker to cut down this path An hour later Mira and I are stretched out on the cushioned benches that flank both sides of the dining table at Raegans house watching Rhiannon rock her nephew by the fireplace lost in conversation with her sister as her parents and brotherinlaw look on from the nearby couch Watching them reunite is worth everything Thank you for helping us I glance over the table at Mira You would have done it with or without me Her smile is soft as she watches the family curling her hand around the pewter mug of wine Rhiannons mom was kind enough to bring earlier Figured at least this way Id know youre safe What other rules have you broken sis She sips her wine and cuts a look my way A smirk tugs at my mouth as I lift one shoulder Maybe a few here and there Ive gotten very good at poisoning my opponents before challenges Mira nearly spits out her wine slamming her hand over her mouth I laugh crossing one booted ankle over the other Not what you were expecting Respect shines in her eyes I honestly dont know what I expected I was just desperate for you to live And then you went and not only bonded one of the most powerful dragons alive but a feathertail too She shakes her head My baby sister is a badass Not sure Mom would agree with that I rub my thumb over the handle of my mug Im not exactly manifesting a signet yet Im solid at grounding and can hold a pretty strong shield but I cant tell her the rest the gift Andarna has given at least for now to me If I dont manifest my signet soon We both know what will happen She quietly studies me in that way she has then says Heres the thing If you want your signet to manifest then stop blocking it by thinking it has anything to do with Mom Your power is yours and yours alone Vi I squirm under her scrutiny and change the subject my gaze dropping to her neck How did that happen Gryphon she answers nodding Near the village of Cranston about seven months ago Thing came out of nowhere in the middle of a village raid The wards went down and usually my signet gives me a little immunity from the enemy wielders but not their fucking birds Took the healers hours to stitch me up But it gave me a pretty cool scar She tilts her chin to show it off Cranston I think back over the Battle Briefs We never learned about that one I Common sense tells me to shut my mouth You what She takes another drink I think theres way more going on along the borders than what were told I admit quietly Mira lifts her brows Well of course there is You dont expect Battle Brief to relay classified information do you You know better than that And honestly at the rate our borders are being attacked theyd have to devote all day to Battle Brief in order to dissect each assault That makes sense Do you guys get all the information Only what we need Like I could have sworn I saw a riot of dragons across the border during this attack She shrugs But questions about secret operations are above my pay grade Think of it this wayif you were a healer would you need to know the details about everyone elses patients I shake my head No Exactly Now tell me what the fuck is going on between you and Dain Ive seen less tension on a crossbow and I dont mean the good kind She gives me a look that leaves no room for excuses I needed to change in order to survive He wouldnt let me It was the simplest explanation for the last nine months I got his friend Amber killed She was a wingleader And honestly everything with Xaden just pushed us so far apart that I dont know how to repair our friendship Not to what it was at least The execution of that wingleader is common knowledge You didnt get her killed She got herself killed by breaking the Codex Mira studies me for a quiet moment Is it true Riorson saved you that night I nod Xaden is a complicated subject So complicated that I cant identify my own feelings Thinking of him only jumbles me in a way that leaves me tangled in knots I want him but I cant trust him not in the ways I want to And yet in other ways hes the person I trust most I hope you know what youre doing there Her grip tightens on her mug Because I distinctly remember warning you to steer clear of that traitors son My stomach turns at Miras description of Xaden Tairn clearly didnt heed the warning She snorts But really if Xaden hadnt shown up that night or if I hadnt been sleeping in the armor I pause and lean forward to touch her hand I cant even begin to tell you how many times youve saved my life without even being there Mira smiles Glad it worked I swear it took an entire molting season to collect all those scales Have you thought of telling Mom about it Getting them made for all riders I told my leadership She leans back and takes another drink They said theyre looking into it We watch Rhiannon kiss her nephews perfect chubby cheeks Ive never seen a family this happy I admit Even when Brennan and Dad were alive we werent likethat No we werent A sad smile curves her mouth as she looks at me But I can remember plenty of nights we spent curled around the fire with Dad and that book you love Ah yes the book you made me leave in my old bedroom I arch a brow You mean the book I snagged just in case Mom got a wild hair and decided to clean out your things while you were in the quadrant Her smile morphs into a grin I have it at Montserrat Figured youd be pissed if you graduated and it was gone I mean whatever would you do if you forgot a minute detail of how the gallant riders took out the army of wyvern and the venin who sucked the land dry of magic I blink Shit I cant remember But I guess Ill be able to read it again soon A bubble of joy rises in my chest You are the best Ill give it to you at the outpost She leans back and gives me a thoughtful look I know theyre just stories but I never used to get why the villains would choose to corrupt their souls and become venin and now Her brow furrows Now you empathize with the villain I tease No She shakes her head But we have the kind of power people would kill for Violet Dragons and gryphons are the gatekeepers and Im sure that to someone jealous enough ambitious enough risking a soul would be a fair price for the ability to wield Her shoulders rise as she shrugs Just makes me glad our dragons are so discerning and our wards keep the gryphon riders at bay Who the hell knows what kind of people those furry creatures choose We stay another hour until we know were risking exposure if we stay a minute longer Then Mira and I give Rhiannon some privacy to say goodbye to her family and head out of the house into the humid night Tairn has been uncharacteristically quiet the last couple of hours Have you been stationed with any riders of mated pairs I ask Mira as I close the door behind us One she answers her eyes narrowing on the darkened path in front of the house Why Im just wondering how long they can be separated Turns out about three days is their max Xaden steps out of the shadows For valor above and beyond the call of duty in the battle of Strythmore where her bravery resulted not only in the destruction of a battery behind enemy lines but also saved the lives of an entire company of infantry I recommend Mira Sorrengail receive the Star of Navarre But if the criterion is not met which I assure you it has been downgrading to the Order of the Talon would be a shame but sufficient Recommendation for Award from Major Potsdam to General Sorrengail CHAPTER TWENTYSEVEN So all we do is wait for something to happen Ridoc asks the next afternoon leaning back in his chair and putting his boots on the end of the wooden table that runs the length of the briefing room Yes Mira says from the head of the table then flicks her wrist and sends Ridoc flying backward And keep your feet off the table One of the Montserrat riders laughs changing the markers on the large map that consumes the only stone wall in the curved windowed room This is the highest turret in the outpost offering unmatched views of the Esben mountain range around us Weve been split into two groups for the day Rhiannon Sawyer Cianna Nadine and Heaton spent the morning with Devera in this room studying previous battles at the outpost and are now out on patrol Dain Ridoc Liam Emery Quinn and I spent the morning on a twohour flight around the surrounding area with one extra tagalongXaden Hes been the worst kind of distraction since arriving last night Dain wont stop glaring at him and making snide remarks Mira keeps one eye on him at all times as well suspiciously quiet since last night And me I cant seem to keep my eyes to myself Theres a palpable energy in every room he enters and it brushes over my skin like a caress each time our eyes meet Even now Im aware of every breath he takes as he sits next to me midway down the table Consider this your Battle Brief Mira continues sideeyeing Ridoc as he scrambles back into his chair This morning was about a quarter of the patrol wed regularly fly so normally wed just be getting back about now and reporting our findings to the commander But for the sake of killing time since were in this room as the reaction flight for this afternoon lets pretend wed come across a newly fortified enemy outpost crossing our bordershe turns to the map and sticks a pin with a small crimson flag near one of the peaks about two miles from the Cygnisen borderlinehere Were supposed to pretend it just popped up overnight Emery asks openly skeptical For the sake of argument thirdyear Mira narrows her eyes on him and he sits up a little straighter I like this game another one of the Montserrat riders says from the end of the table lacing his fingers behind his neck What would our objective be Mira glances around the table noticeably skipping Xaden Last night shed taken one look at the rebellion relic on his neck and walked by without saying a word Aetos Dain startles from where he was glowering across the table at Xaden and turns to face the map What type of fortifications are there Are we talking a haphazard wooden structure Or something more substantial Like they had time to build a fortress overnight Ridoc mutters It has to be wooden right You are all so fucking literal Mira sighs and rubs her thumb over her forehead Fine lets say they occupied a keep thats already established Stone and all But the civilians didnt call for help Quinn asks scratching her pointed chin Protocol calls for a distress signal this far into the mountains They should have lit their distress beacon alerting patrolling riders at which time the dragons on patrol would have told all available dragons in the area The very riders in this room would have mounted first as the reaction force and the others would have been woken from their rests allowing the riders to prevent the loss of the keep in the first place Mira scoffs and braces her hands on the end of the table staring us all down Everything youre taught at Basgiath is theory You analyze past attacks and learn those verytheoretical combat maneuvers But things out here dont always go according to plan So why dont we talk about all the ways things can go sideways so youll know what to do when they do as opposed to arguing that the keep shouldnt have fallen Quinn shifts her weight uncomfortably How many of you have been called out as thirdyears Mira stands straight folding her arms over her black leathers and the strap that holds her sword to her back Emery and Xaden raise their hands though Xadens is barely a gesture Dain looks like his head is about to explode Thats not correct Were never called into service until graduation Xaden presses his lips in a tight line and nods giving him a sarcastic thumbsup Yeah all right Emery laughs Just wait until next year I cant count how many times were the ones sitting in these very rooms in the midland forts because their riders have been called to the front for an emergency The color drains from Dains face Now thats settled Mira reaches under the table and pulls out a set of models putting a sixinch stone keep in the center of the table Catch One by one she tosses painted wooden models of dragons at us keeping one for herself Pretend Messina and Exal dont exist back there and were the only squad available to take back that keep Think of the power in this room Think of what each individual rider brings to the table and how youd use those powers in unison to conquer your objective But they dont teach that to firstyears Liam says slowly from the other side of me Mira glances at the whirls of magic on his wrist but to Liams credit he doesnt tug his sleeve down Its hard to remember sometimes that the thirdyears are the first riders who will serve with the children of the leaders of the Tyrrish uprisingan uprising that could have left our borders eventually defenseless and the innocent people of Navarre war casualties Everyone in this room has become accustomed to Liam Imogeneven Xaden But those in active service have never flown with anyone marked by a rebellion relic The Tyrrish riders who remained loyal to Navarre during the uprising were promoted not punished and the riders who turned against king and country were killed or executed And just like my grief at Brennans loss was directed at Xaden that first day at the parapet there will be more than one rider who misdirects their own anger at marked riders I clear my throat Miras gaze meets mine and I lift an eyebrow at her in clear warning Dont fuck with my friends Her eyes widen ever so slightly and she directs her attention back to Liam They might not teach you this battle strategy as firstyears because youre all busy trying to stay on your dragons You had your first taste of strategy during the Squad Battle and its almost May which means final War Games should be beginning right Two weeks Dain answers Good timing then Not all of you will survive the games if youre not prepared She holds my gaze for a beat This kind of thinking will give your squadyour entire wingan advantage since I guarantee your wingleader is already assessing every rider for their own abilities Xaden flips his dragon model over his knuckles but doesnt reply He hasnt spoken a word to Mira since arriving So lets do this Mira stands back Who is in command She glances toward Quinn And lets pretend that I dont have three years of seniority on even the highestranked of you Then Im in command Dain sits up straight his chin rising a good inch Our wingleader is here Liam argues pointing at Xaden I would say that puts him in command We can pretend Im not here just for the sake of the exercise Xaden sets his dragon on the table and leans back in his chair draping his arm across the back of mine a move that makes Dain grit his teeth Give Aetos here the position we all know he craves Dont be a dick I whisper You havent even seen me start to be a dick My head turns so fast that it swims and my mouth drops open as I stare at the side of Xadens face That was his voicein my fucking head He turns the golden flecks in his eyes catching the light and I swear I hear him laughing in my mind though his lips are closed tilted in that pulsequickening smirk of his Youre staring Its going to get awkward in about thirty seconds if you dont stop How I hiss The same way you talk to Sgaeyl Were all gloriously annoyingly linked This is just one of the perks Though Im starting to wish Id tried it sooner The look on your face is priceless He winks and turns back to the table He Fucking Winked And is that a hint of a smile Youre The Wingleader Every word Dain speaks comes out through clenched teeth Im not even supposed to be here Xaden shrugs But if it makes you feel better for the purpose of War Games youd be getting your orders from your section leader Garrick Tavis which hed get from me Youll be carrying out your maneuvers as a squad for the good of the wing Just pretend Im another member of your squad and use me as you wish Aetos Xaden folds his arms across his chest I glance at Mira whos watching the playbyplay with raised brows Why are you even here Dain challenges No offense sir but we werent exactly expecting senior leadership on this trip Youre more than aware that Sgaeyl and Tairn are mated Three days Dain fires back leaning in You couldnt make it three days It has nothing to do with him I interrupt setting my dragon down with a little more force than necessary Thats up to Tairn and Sgaeyl You never considered that it was you I couldnt stay away from I crook my right arm and jab it into Xadens biceps He doesnt mean that Not when hes still adamant that kissing me was a mistake And if he does Im not going there Now now youll give our little communication secret away if you cant keep from being soviolent He barely restrains a smile obviously loving that he gets the last word I need to figure out how the hell hes doing it so I can mentally argue back Of course you rush to defend him Dain hurls a hurt glare at me Though how you can forget that this guy wanted to kill you six months ago is beyond me I blink up at him I can not believe you went there Good job remaining professional Aetos Xaden scratches the relic on his neck Im all but certain doesnt actually itch Really shows those leadership qualities to their best advantage One of the riders down the table whistles low Do you boys just want to whip it out and measure It would be faster Liam smothers a laugh but his shoulders shake Enough Mira slams her hands on the table Oh come on Sorrengail the rider down the table whines with a wide smile Both Mira and I look his way I meanthe older Sorrengail This is the best entertainment weve had in ages I shake my head and look around the table Mira has the ability to extend the shield if the wards are down so the first thing I would do is send her to scout the area with Teine We need to know if were dealing with infantry or gryphon riders Good Mira moves her dragon closer to the castle Now lets assume there are gryphons You want to do your job I ask Dain smiling sweetly I mean how you can forget youre the squad leader is beyond me His hand clenches around his own dragon as he rips his gaze from mine Quinn can you astral project from the back of your dragon Yes she answers Then I would have you project into the fortress to check for signs of weakness Dain orders And have you report back Same with Liam Wed use your farsight to see if you can locate where the gryphon riders are and if there are any traps Good The weaknesses are the wooden gate Mira notes as Quinn and Liam move their dragons into position and the Navarrian citizens they have captive in the dungeons So much for blasting the whole place Ridoc says Youre an air wielder right Dain asks Emery So you can shape your dragons flames lead them through the occupied parts of the keep without killing civilians Yes Emery answers But Id have to be in the keep Then youll have to get into the keep Mira says with a shrug Emerys eyes widen You want me to leave my dragon and go on foot Why do you think we get all that handtohand training Or are you going to leave all those innocent people to die Mira flicks her wrist and Emerys dragon goes flying out of his hand and into hers She puts it in the center of the keep The real question is how do we get you close enough without getting you killed She glances around the table Since Im guessing the others will be busy fighting off the gryphons that launch once the fireworks start Whats your signet Aetos Quinn asks Above your pay grade Dain answers glancing around the table and skipping over Xaden then making the rounds again finally sighing Any ideas Is the quadrant really making Dain keep the memory reading secret Had him reaching for my head the day Amber burned been a loss of control How has he gotten this far without telling anyone what his signet is I shake my head Sure I pick up Xadens dragon and shove it toward the keep planting one mental foot in the Archives where I keep my power and using it to lift the dragon figurine into a hover above the structure You stop ignoring that you have an incredibly powerful shadow wielder at your disposal and ask him to black out the area so no one sees you land Shes not wrong Mira agrees but her words are clipped You can do that Dain begrudgingly looks at Xaden Are you seriously asking Xaden retorts Just wasnt sure you could cover an area that Xaden lifts a hand a few inches above the table and shadows pour from underneath our seats filling the room and turning it dark as midnight in a blink My heart jumps as my sight goes black Relax Its just me A ghost of a touch skims my cheek Just him is slightlyterrifying I shove that thought at him but theres no response Maybe we have a onewaycommunication thing going on over here because I dont think I can talk to him the way he does me What had Sgaeyl said about signets It reflects who you are at the core of your being It makes sense Mira is protective Dain has to know everything And Xadenhas secrets Fuck me someone says I can surround this entire outpost but I think that might freak some people out Xaden says and the shadows disappear racing back under the table I draw in a full breath noting that everyone at the table besides Emerywho has no doubt seen Xaden pull this kind of trick beforelooks slightly greenish Even Mira whos staring at Xaden like hes a threat she needs to assess My stomach turns I hope you didnt get any ideas while we were in the dark there Xaden teases and just like that my sympathy for the ass evaporates I dont bother to face him just raise one finger He chuckles and I grit my teeth Get him out of my head I toss in Tairns direction Youll get used to it Tairn responds Is this normal with all mated pairs and their riders For some Its a great advantage in a battle Well its a pain in my ass right now I miss Andarna Were so far apart that I can barely feel her Then shield him out the same way you do meor start talking back Tairn grumbles You have the power to be a pain in the ass too Trust me And how exactly am I supposed to talk back at him I give Xaden a heavy dose of sideeye but hes engrossed in the ongoing battle weve waged against an imaginary keep Figure out which pathway into your mind is his Oh joy That should be easy We finish the hypothetical operation each of us using our power to its best abilityeveryone except me But when its time to take the gryphons out in the air Tairn overpowers every other dragon in the room Good job Mira says glancing at her pocket watch Aetos Riorson and Sorrengail I want to see you in the hallway The rest of you are dismissed Its not like any of us has an option so we follow Mira out to the spiral staircase She shuts the door behind us and throws up a line of blue energy that covers the entrance Sound shield Dain says with a smile Nice Shut up Mira spins on the top step putting her finger in Dains face I dont know what bug has crawled up your ass Dain Aetos but have you forgotten that youre a squad leader That you have a very real chance of becoming a wingleader next year Oh shit shes pissed and thats not anything I want a part of I retreat another step but with Xaden beneath me on the stairs theres nowhere left to go Mira Dain starts Lieutenant Sorrengail Mira responds Youre blowing it Dain I know how badly you want his job next year She points a finger at Xaden Dont forget that weve grown up about ten feet apart And you are blowing it because what Youre pissed that Violet bonded his dragons mate Heat stings my cheeks Shes never been one to mince words but justdamn He is the worst possible thing for her Dain counters Oh Im not arguing that She leans into his space But theres nothing anyone can do about the choices of dragons They dont bother with the opinions of mere humans do they But whatever is going on between the two of youthat finger swings between Dain and meis fucking up your squad If I can see it after four days with you then they sure as hell can tell And if Id known that you were going to be such a hardass with zero flexibility for the things she cant control I never would have told her to find you after crossing the parapet She glances at me then back at him You two have been best friends since you were five years old Figure your shit out Dain is so tense he looks like he might crack in half but he glances at me and nods I do the same Good now get back in there She motions toward the door with her head and Dain leaves walking through the shield And as for you She walks down two steps and pins Xaden with a glare Is this what she can expect next year Aetos being an asshole Xaden asks leaving his hands loose at his sides Probably Miras eyes narrow Mated dragons typically bond riders in the same year for a reason You can not expect your assigned wing or her instructors to let you both fly off every three days Wasnt my choice He shrugs What are we supposed to do Tell the giant flamethrowing dragons how its going to be I ask my sister Yes she exclaims turning toward me Because you cant live this way Violet Youll be the one who ends up missing the training you need because hes the more powerful of the two of you right now But if you dont get to focus on your training then thats how it will always be You wont ever become who Tairn can push you to be Is that what youre after Riorson Mira I whisper shaking my head Youre wrong about him Listen to me She grasps my shoulders He might wield shadows Violet but give him his way and youll become one That wont happen I promise her It will if he has anything to say about it Her gaze flickers behind me Killing someone isnt the only way to destroy them Keeping you from reaching your potential seems like a great path to the retribution he swore against our mother Think long and hard How well do you even really know him I suck in a breath I trust Xaden At least I think I do But Miras right there are infinite ways to demolish someone without ending their life Thats what I thought The look in her eyes turns to something worse than anger Its pity Do you even know why he hates our mother so much Why the kids like him are put on the para Im right here Xaden interrupts rising to the same step to stand at my side In case you didnt notice Youre kind of hard to miss she retorts Youre not listening His voice lowers I Am Here Tairn didnt drag her back to Basgiath He didnt break through her shields and pour his emotions into her He didnt demand she fly across the fucking kingdom Your sister is still right here Im the one who left my post my position and my executive officer in charge of my wing Shes not missing out on shit And next year When youre a brandnew lieutenant What shit is she going to miss out on then Mira asks Well figure it out I reach for her hand and squeeze Mira hes taken every spare minute he has to train me on the mat for challenges or take me flying in hopes Ill finally figure out how to keep my damned seat without Tairn holding me in place Hes She flinches You cant keep your seat No Its barely a whisper and the heat of embarrassment scorches my skin How the hell can you not Her mouth hangs open Because Im not you I shout She rears back like Ive slapped her our hands breaking apart But youyou look so much stronger now My joints and muscles are stronger because Imogen makes me lift these horrible weights but that doesntfix me Mira blanches No I didnt mean it like that Vi Youre not anything that needs to be fixed I just didnt know you couldnt hold your seat Why didnt you tell me Because theres nothing you can do about it I force a wry smile Theres nothing anyone can do about the way Im made A long uncomfortable silence stretches between us For as close as we are theres still so much we dont share Shes getting better Xaden offers his voice calm and even The first few weeks weredisastrous Hey he caught me before I hit the ground I argue Barely Xaden grumbles before turning back to Mira You dont have to trust me Good because I dont she says All of that power in the hands of someone with your history is bad enough but to know your dragons are so tangled up that you cant be more than three days from Violet is unacceptable in every possible way I can think She goes completely still her eyes unfocusing Theres a drift of gryphons headed this way Tairn bellows Fuck The wards are down Mira mutters apparently receiving the same alarm from Teine She clutches my shoulders and yanks me into a hug You have to go We can help I argue but she holds me so tightly that I cant move You cant And if Tairn is using his power to keep you seated then hes diminished as well You have to go Get out of here If you love me Violet youll go so I dont have to worry about you too She releases me looking to Xaden as our squad pours out of the door above thundering by as they run down the steps Get her out of here Lets go Dain shouts Now Even if you dont trust me Im the best weapon you have Xaden snarls at Mira If what you say is true then youre the best weapon she has The other half of the squad will be here in moments and Teine thinks we have about twenty minutes until the gryphons arrive Miras eyes meet mine You have to get to safety Violet I love you Dont die Id hate to be an only child Theres no cocky grin like when she left me at Basgiath on Conscription Day Xaden hauls me against his side as Mira runs up the remaining stairs toward the roof This cant be happening Theres no way I can flee to safety and leave my sister here with absolutely zero way of knowing if shes alive or dead This feels like the exact sort of thing wed never hear about in Battle Brief No fucking way Every cell in my body rebels at the thought No I fight but theres no point Hes too strong Mira What if you get hurt Tairns speed could be the only thing that saves you At least let us stay She looks over her shoulder at the doorway but theres steel in her expression You want me to trust you Riorson Get her the fuck out of here and find a way for her to keep her seat We both know shes dead if she doesnt Mira I scream clawing at Xadens arms but hes already half carrying me down the stairs with an arm clamped around my waist as if I weigh less than the sword on his back I love you I call up the turret but theres no way of knowing if she heard me Can I trust you to get your own pack Xaden asks as he marches down the hallway of the barracks Or am I going to have to carry you out of here without whatever you brought Ill get it myself I shove at him and he lets me go It takes mere minutes to grab my pack and Rhiannons since weve left them intact even cramming in our cloaks Then Im back in the hallway where Xaden waits his own pack slung over his shoulder It looks considerably smaller than the one he arrived with and I dont want to even think about what hes left behind in order to force me out faster I dont bother looking at him marching for the door but he grabs my elbow and spins me around Nope Its too dangerous to leave the fortress walls Were going up He wraps his arm around my waist and all but hauls me to the nearest turret Climb This is bullshit I yell at him uncaring that every other member of our squad whos climbing the same turret can hear Tairn could help them Your sister is right You have to make it out so were leaving Now fucking climb Dain I argue realizing hes right in front of us He turns around and takes Rhiannons pack slinging it over his own shoulder For once Riorson and I agree Its not just you we have to get out Violet Think of every other firstyear The plea in his eyes shuts my mouth Are you going to sentence an entire untrained squad to death Because Ill make it Cianna Emery and Heaton will too And we all fucking know Riorson will But what about Rhiannon Ridoc Sawyer You want their deaths on your hands he asks his words choppy as we race upward toward the open door This isnt about me We burst onto the roof as Emery mounts his dragon who is precariously perched on the thinnerthanquadrant wall Oh gods Im never going to be able to mount Tairn at this angle Ridoc and Quinn are already in the air Liam tells us as Emery launches skyward where Cath and Deigh hover their wings beating the air Youre next Xaden shouts at Liam and Dain nods Deigh crumbles the masonry with the force of his landing and Liam takes off down the narrow walkway toward the large Red Daggertail You next Aetos Xaden barks Vi Dain starts to argue Thats an order Theres no room for argument in that tone and we all know it especially when Cath takes Deighs place on the wall Ive got her Go Go I urge Id never be able to live with myself if something happened to Dain on my account He may have been an ass the last few months but that doesnt negate the years hes been my best friend Dain looks like hes about to fight but finally nods turning to Xaden Im trusting you to get her out Theres a lot of that going around today Xaden retorts Now get on your dragon so I can get her on hers Dain gives me a long intense look then turns and runs racing up Caths foreleg in a way thats so reminiscent of the Gauntlet that I get flashbacks Where are you I ask Tairn seeing empty skies above us Almost there I was doing what could be done I cant do this I say to Xaden turning in his arms to face him The others are gone Call it the favor you owe me I dont care We can stay I cant just leave her here Its wrong and its something shed never do to me I have to stay for her I just have to Theres so much compassion so much understanding in his eyes that when he lets go of my waist I think he might just let me stay Then his hands are on my cheeks sliding back to cup the base of my neck as he brings his mouth to mine The kiss is reckless and consuming and I give it my all knowing it might be the last one His tongue licks into my mouth with an urgency I return angling to take him deeper Gods its not just as good as Id been fantasizing about remembering that night Its so much better He was careful with me against that wall but there is nothing hesitant about the way he lays claim to my mouth nothing cautious about the ache that pulses low in my stomach He only breaks the kiss when were both panting then rests his forehead against mine Leave for me Violet Almost there Tairn says Xadens been stalling to give Tairn and Sgaeyl time to arrive My heart sinks like a rock pinning my feet in place I will hate you for this Yeah He nods a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away I can live with that His hands fall away from my face and reach for my arms lifting them so Im shaped like a T Arms up Hold tight Fuck You The enormous shape of Tairn appears behind him and Xaden drops to the stone floor just as Tairn flies directly above his shadow falling over me a second before his foreclaw scoops me up like hes done countless times when Ive fallen midflight You have to take us back I have done everything I can and will not risk your life He climbs in altitude then throws me up onto his back in a practiced maneuver Now hold on so we can outfly them I look over my shoulder and see Xaden on Sgaeyl approaching quickly and farther behind them hundreds of feet below a dozen gryphons envelop the keep Winning the War Games isnt about strength Its about cunning To know how to strike you have to understand where your enemiesyour friendsare most vulnerable No one stays friends forever Mira Eventually those closest to us become our enemies in some way even if its through wellintentioned love or apathy or if we live long enough to become their villains Page eighty the Book of Brennan CHAPTER TWENTYEIGHT The stone wall outside Professor Markhams office in the Riders Quadrant digs into my back irritating my relic as I brace all my weight next to the closed door Im ready to crawl out of my own skin with worry and the insufferable buildup of power thats threatening to combust at any moment Its been two days since we left Montserrat One day of flight back to Basgiath and one excruciatingly long day of silence The sun is barely up I havent done library duty since returning and Ive somehow managed to get out the door before Liam even knows Im gone Breakfast doesnt matter I couldnt give a shit if I miss formation This is the only place I can contemplate being Footsteps on the circular staircase to the left make my stomach tense and my pulse jumps as my gaze flies to the doorway looking for the first sign of a cream tunic Instead Xaden walks into the hallway holding two steaming pewter mugs as he heads straight for me Still hate me Absolutely Thats not entirely true but its easy to blame all the guilt Ive been eating for two straight days on him Figured youd already be waiting He holds out one of the mugs as an offering Its coffee Sgaeyl says you havent slept Its none of Sgaeyls business if Im sleeping I snip But thanks I take the cup He looks like hes had a full eight hours and a vacation since yesterday I bet youre sleeping like a baby Quit telling Sgaeyl about my sleep habits I grumble at Tairn Im not dignifying that demand with a response Andarna is my favorite Tairn snorts Xaden leans back against the wall across from me and sips his coffee I havent slept well since the night my father left Aretia to declare the secession My lips part That was more than six years ago He stares at his coffee You were I pause I dont even know how old you are now Mira was right I know almost nothing about him And yetI feel like I know who he is in the very marrow of his bones Could my emotions be any more scattered when it comes to him Twentythree he answers My birthday was in March And I didnt even know Mine is in July he answers with a ghost of a smile I know I made it my business to know everything there was to know about you the second I saw you on the parapet Because thats not creepy I let the coffee warm my freezing hands Cant know how to ruin someone without understanding them first he says quietly I lift my gaze to find that his is already on me And is that still your plan Miras words have haunted me for two days He flinches No What changed Frustration tightens my grip on the mug When exactly did you decide not to ruin me Maybe it was when I saw Oren holding a knife to your throat he says Or maybe it was when I realized the bruises on your neck were fingerprints and wanted to kill them all over again just so I could do it slowly Maybe it was the first time I recklessly kissed you or when I realized Im fucked because I cant stop thinking about doing more than just kissing you My breath catches at his admission but he just sighs lets his head fall back against the wall Does it even matter when as long as it changed between us Dont do that I whisper and he lifts his head again to hold my gaze Dont do what Tell you I cant get you out of my head Or speak directly into yours Either You could learn to do it too Why the hell is it so impossible to look away from him To remember that kiss on that tower had been a game to him that this all might be a game to him To quell this impossible ache that swirls in my stomach every time I think about him Come on give it a try As I stare into his goldflecked eyes I decide hes right I could at least meet him halfway and try I put one mental foot in my Archives and feel power ripple through my veins Bright orange crackling energy streams in from the door behind me and theres a golden light that shines from the window I created just for Andarna I take a deep breath and turn slowly And there swirling along the edge of the roofline is a shadow of sparkling night Xaden Footsteps sound on the stairs and we both look Guess you two had the same idea Dain says when he sees us coming to stand along the wall beside me How long have you been waiting Not long Xaden answers Hours I say simultaneously Damn Violet Dain runs a hand through his damp hair Are you hungry Do you want to get breakfast No dumbass she doesnt obviously Xadens snide commentary fills my head Knock that the fuck off I toss back No thank you Look who figured it out Xadens mouth quirks upward for a heartbeat Another set of footsteps echoes up the staircase and I hold my breath my eyes locked on the doorway Professor Markham pauses when he sees the three of us outside his office then continues toward us To what do I owe the pleasure Just tell me if shes dead I move into the center of the hall Markham looks at me with more than his fair share of disapproval You know I cant give out classified information If theres anything to be discussed well do it in Battle Brief We were there If its classified then we already know about it I counter my hands starting to tremble as I squeeze the pewter harder and harder Xaden takes the mug from me Its hardly appropriate for me to Shes my sister I plead I deserve to know if shes alive and I deserve not to hear about it in a room full of riders His jaw tightens There was considerable damage to the outpost but we lost no riders at Montserrat Thank gods My knees give out and Dain catches me pulling me into his familiar hug as relief floods my system Shes fine Vi Dain whispers into my hair Miras fine I nod fighting against a swell of emotions to keep my control I will not break down I will not cry I will not show weakness Not here Theres only one place I can go one person who wont chide me for crumbling The second I have myself in hand I step out of Dains arms Xaden is gone I skip breakfast and miss formation to head to the flight field holding myself together long enough to get to the middle of the meadow where I drop to my knees Shes all right I cry my head falling into my hands I didnt leave her to die Shes alive Theres a ruffle of air and then the hard feel of scales against the backs of my hands I lean forward into Andarnas shoulder sagging against her Shes alive Shes alive Shes alive I repeat it until I believe it Do you have any siblings I ask Xaden the next time were on the mat Maybe its Miras comment about me not knowing enough about him or maybe its my own conflicting emotions but he knows way more about me than I do him and I need to level this playing field No He pauses in surprise Why Just asking I take a fighting stance Lets go The next day I ask him what his favorite food is in the middle of Battle Brief using our mental connection Pretty sure I hear him drop something at the back of the room before he answers Chocolate cake Stop being weird I grin A day later after Tairn puts me through an absolutely draining set of advanced flight maneuvers most thirdyears couldnt stay seated through either were perched on a mountain peak with Tairn and Sgaeyl when I ask him how he knows Liam just to see if hell tell me the truth We were fostered together What is with all the questions lately I barely know you You know me well enough He shoots me a look that says hes over it Hardly Tell me something real Like what He turns in his seat to face me Something like what those silver scars on your back are from I hold my breath waiting for the answer waiting for him to say anything that might let me in Even from twenty feet away I can see him tense Why do you want to know My grip tightens on the pommel scales I instinctively knew the scars were private but his reaction says theres more to them than just a painful memory Why dont you want to tell me Sgaeyl startles then launches into the air leaving Tairn and me behind Are you pushing for a reason Tairn asks Can you give me one not to He cares for you Thats already hard enough for him I scoff He cares about keeping me alive Theres a difference Not for him there isnt The afternoon skies above Basgiath are crystal clear in the middle of May for the first battle of the War Games that signify the approach of graduation As much as I want to feel excitement that Im so close to actually surviving my first year in the Riders Quadrant my stomach is tight with anxiety Battle Briefs are getting more redacted Professor Carr is getting more anxious that I havent manifested a signet like almost the entire firstyear cadets Dain is acting weird as fuckfriendly one minute and indifferent the next Xaden is getting more secretiveif that were even possiblecanceling some of our training for unexplained reasons Even Tairn feels like theres something hes not telling me What do you think our assignment is going to be Liam asks from my right as we stand in formation in the center of the courtyard with the rest of Fourth Wing Deigh thinks were on offense He wont stop going on about getting to kick Gleanns ass He pauses as if listening to his dragon Guess dragons hold grudges he finally whispers Leadership is gathered ahead of us getting their assignments from Xaden Were definitely on offense Rhiannon answers from my left Otherwise wed already be in the field I havent seen a single rider from First Wing since lunch My stomach bottoms out First Wing Go figure theyd be our first opponent Anything goes out there during War Games and Jack Barlowe hasnt forgotten that I put him in the infirmary for four days He gave me a wider berth for weeks after Xaden executed Oren and the other kids who had attacked meand of course everyone stopped fucking with me after Amber Mavis But still Id catch a look from him as we passed in the halls or in the cafeteria pure hatred burning in the glacial blue depths of his eyes I think shes right I tell Liam struggling not to fidget as the sun bakes through my flight leathers Its been a while since Ive envied the scribes and their cream uniforms but this weather has me feeling like we got the shorter end of the uniform stick It also doesnt help that I must have slept wrong because my knee is killing me and the stabilizing wrap feels like its a million degrees Why do you think riders wear black anyway Because its badass Ridoc answers from behind me So its harder to see when we bleed Imogen chimes in Forget I asked I mumble watching for any signs that the leadership meeting will be over soon Bleeding is the last thing I want to do today Are we on offense or defense I ask Xaden Little busy right now Oh no am I distracting you A smile curves my mouth Shit am I flirting Maybe Do I care Oddly enoughno Yes His tone is so gruff that I have to press my lips in a tight line to keep from laughing Come on Youre taking forever over there Give a girl a hint Both he growls but he doesnt shut me out with his shieldswhich I know he can doso I have a little mercy on him and the meeting hes supposed to be leading and leave him be Offense and defense This afternoon should be interesting You hear from Mira Rhiannon whispers shooting me a quick glance I shake my head Thats justinhumane Did you honestly think theyd break the nocorrespondence rule Even if they tried Mom would have shut that down with a quickness Rhiannon sighs and I dont blame her Theres not much more to say on the subject The leadership meeting breaks up and Dain heads over with Cianna Hes practically beaming his hands clenching and unclenching with nervous energy Which is it Heaton asks Offense or defense Both he says as the other squad leaders report back to their riders I fake surprise and glance past him but Xaden and the section leaders are nowhere to be seen First Wing has taken a defensive position in one of the practice forts in the mountains and theyre guarding a crystal egg Dain tells us and the older riders in our squad murmur with excitement Makes sense Its probably a symbolic nod to the different breeds of dragons bringing their eggs to Basgiath when Navarre unified What are we missing Ridoc asks Because you guys seemed thrilled about an egg From past years we know that eggs are worth more points Cianna says grinning enthusiastically Flags have statistically been the lowest and captured professors rank somewhere in the middle But they like to switch it up Dain adds The same way we could be going for a real objective on the line only to discover its not as valuable as we thought So how is this both offense and defense Rhiannon asks If they have the egg then clearly we should go get the egg Because weve also been given a flag to defend and no outpost to do it in He grins And our squad has been assigned to carry it You gave Dain the mission to defend Fourth Wings flag Im hoping he learned something from your sisters lesson at Montserrat Xaden replies but his voice is quieter which Im starting to learn means hes farther away I cant help but wonder if well have the ability to communicate this way in a few months when more distance separates us My chest aches at the thought that he wont be here Hell be risking his life on the front lines And who is going to carry this flag Imogen asks Dain somehow manages to smile even wider Thats going to be the fun part Over the next twenty minutes were drilled in strategy during the walk over to the flight field and from the sound of it Dain was paying attention to Mira The plan is simple play to our individual strengths and pass the flag often never giving First Wing a chance to spot who is carrying it When we get to the flight field there are dozens upon dozens of dragons filling the muddy field all positioned as though they had formation in their squads too Its easy to spot Tairn seeing as his head rises above all others Theres a palpable air of anticipation as we walk by the other squads all mounting as the squad and section leaders give out lastminute orders Were going to win Rhiannon says with confidence linking her arm with mine as we approach our section of the field What makes you so sure We have you Tairn Riorson and Sgaeyl And obviouslyme She grins Theres no way were losing this You are certainly My words die as Tairn comes into full view He stands tall and proud at the front of our section not bothering to give deference to Cath as Dains dragon but its not his position that steals my breath Its the saddle strapped across his back that has me gawking I hear its all the fashion Tairn brags Thats I dont even have words The black metal bands look to be intricately linked as they loop around each foreleg and come together at the front of his chest forming a triangular plate before rising above his shoulders to a saddle with strapped secure stirrups Thats a saddle Thats cool thats what that is Rhiannon thumps my back And it looks way more comfortable than Feirges bony spine Ill tell you that See you up there She walks past Tairn toward her own mount I cant use that I shake my head Its not allowed I decide whats allowed and whats not Tairn growls lowering his head to my level and blasting me with a chuff of steam There is no rule that says a dragon can not modify their seat to serve their rider You have worked just as hardif not harderthan every rider in this quadrant Just because your body is built differently than the others doesnt mean you dont deserve to keep your seat It takes more than a few strips of leather and a pommel to define a rider Hes right you know Xaden agrees as he approaches and I briefly wonder where hed gone that hes back so quickly No one asked you My pulse jolts and my skin flushes at the sight of him Our uniforms make every rider look good but Xaden takes even that up a notch with the way it cuts across the muscled lines of his body If you dont use it Ill take personal offense He folds his arms across his chest and studies the rigging Considering I had it made for you and just about got myself burned alive in the process of trying to get it on him He lifts a brow at Tairn Even though he helped design it I might add The first models were unacceptable and you had the gall to pinch my chest scales when clumsily assembling it this morning Tairns golden eyes narrow on Xaden How was I to know the leather from the prototype would burn so easily And its not like there are a lot of manuals on fitting a saddle to a dragon Xaden drawls It doesnt matter because I cant use it I turn to face Xaden Its beautiful a marvel of engineering And His jaw locks And everyone here will know I cant keep my seat without it Heat stings my cheeks Hate to break it to you Violence but everyone already knows that He gestures to the saddle That right there is the most practical way for you to ride It has straps across your thighs to buckle yourself in once youre up and theoretically you should be able to change positions on long flights without unbuckling since we built in a lap belt too Theoretically He wasnt amenable to me giving it a test flight You can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones wingleader Well thats descriptive Look theres no rule against it I checked And if anything youll be doing Tairn a favor by freeing all his power and taking the weight of worry off his mind Mine too if that helps matters My fingernails bite into my palms as I search for another reason another excuse but there isnt one I might not want to appear different than every other rider on this field but I already am Fuck that stubborn feisty look always makes me want to kiss you Xadens expression remains bland bored even but his eyes heat as his gaze drops to my mouth And you say this now where people will see if you actually do My breath catches When did I ever give you the impression that I give a fuck what people think about me A corner of his mouth rises and now its all I can concentrate on damn him I only care what they think about you Because hes a wingleader Nothing is worse than cadets gossiping that youve slept your way to safety Thats what Mira warned at Parapet Mount up Sorrengail We have a battle to win I rip my gaze from his and study the exquisite intricate structure of the saddle Its beautiful Thank you Xaden Youre welcome He turns but leans into my space and a shiver dances down my spine when his lips brush my ear Consider my favor fulfilled Is that a saddle I jump back from Xaden but he doesnt budge an inch as Dain interrupts holding a giant yellow flag on a fourfoot pole his eyes wide as he stares at Tairn No its a collar Tairn snips snapping his teeth together Dain backs up a few steps Yes Xaden answers Have a problem with it No Dain looks at Xaden like hes being unreasonable Why would I have an issue with it Im fine with whatever keeps Violet safe if you havent noticed Good Xaden nods once and turns toward me Bet it would be even more awkward if I kissed you now huh Yes please The next time we kiss had better not be just to piss off Dain The next time had better only be because we want it Next time huh His gaze lowers to my mouth again And of course now thats all Im thinking about the feel of his lips on mine the way his hands always cradle the nape of my neck the slide of his tongue I stop myself from leaning in Barely Go lead your wingor do whatever it is you do Ill be stealing an egg His smile flashes before he turns back to Dain Keep our flag out of First Wings hands Dain nods and Xaden leaves heading across the field to where Sgaeyl waits Its a great saddle Dain says It is I agree and Dain offers me a smile before walking toward Cath Moving toward Tairns foreleg I have to laugh as he dips his shoulder for me What No ladder We thought about it and decided it would make you too vulnerable Of course you thought about I pause before climbing when a flash of gold gallops toward me Andarna I want to battle too She skids to a halt directly in front of me My mouth opens and shuts Andarna has been flying with us and for short times she can keep up with Tairn but the way those scales shine in the sun is a beacon foreveryone But if I can have a saddle then Got it My eyes sweep the flight field which is at the height of its muddiest since the runoff season from the snowy peaks above Go roll I point to the mud Unless thats going to mess with your wings Its the scales on your belly Im most worried about being easily spotted No problem She races off and I mount Tairn finding the actual saddle covering the seat at the base of his neck and the pommel scales I thought you said leather was bad The saddle itself is sumptuous black leather complete with two raised pommels for my hands and when I settle in it fits like a dream I bend and adjust the stirrups with the buckle system on the straps The leather is a hazard on my chest if we take a fire attack since your saddle would slide right off But if you take a direct blast up there sitting on a piece of metal isnt going to save you I dont bother pointing out that the only fire wed be taking is from other dragons which is a problem that doesnt exist since gryphons are all beak and claw Instead I find the straps for my thighs and buckle in This is ingenious I say to Xaden Let me know if it needs modifications after we win today Arrogant ass Were airborne moments later Andarna keeping up and staying tucked close to Tairn just like weve practiced Our mission is to keep the flag out of enemy hands so we skirt the perimeter of the hundredmile battlefield that encompasses most of the central range while the other squads handle reconnaissance and retrieval About an hour into the afternoon Im wondering if this assignment is actually meant as punishment for Dain and not an honor The twelve of us are split into two tight formations of six seven when taking Andarna into account Dain has the flag in his group just ahead of us and when we reach yet another peak in the range he splits to the right Tairn banks to the left and my stomach pitches as we sweep down the side of the mountain The wide straps dig into my thighs holding me firmly in place and my heart thunders as pure exhilaration hits as hard as the rush of wind against my face and goggles as we dive and dive and dive And for the first time theres no fear that Ill tumble off his back Slowly I unclench my hands from the pommels and a heartbeat later my hands are above my head as we plummet toward the valley below Ive lived twenty years and never felt as alive as I do in this moment Without even grounding in my Archives power surges in my veins crackling with a life all its own jolting every single one of my senses to a degree that nears pain Tairn flares his wings catching air and pulling out of the dive Youre going to have to work on those shoulder muscles Silver One Well practice this week Leaning as far as I can out of the saddle I see Andarna clutched in Tairns claw as we level out in a glide along the valley floor Thanks Ive got it now Andarna says and Tairn lets her free Power rattles my bones as if its looking for a way out and I force myself upright Its different than usuallike instead of standing ready to be molded by my hands it wants to mold me A moment of fear skitters along my spine What if the backlash of power from not manifesting a signet has chosen today to finally release I shake my head I do not have time to worry about what might happennot in the middle of the War Games My power is just feeling free because Im finally not so focused on falling out of my seat Thats all it is Sitting tall in the saddle I sweep my unsteady gaze along the landscape as Tairn begins to climb again and my heart stutters Up high on the western ridgeline is a gray tower that almost blends in to the cliffside I would have missed it if not for the Is that what I think it is Fear only feeds the uncontrollable energy prickling my skin Tairns head is already turned in that direction Dragons I glance over my shoulder toward Liam and Rhiannon and see that Tairn must have relayed the message because we break formation scattering as three dragons launch from the cliff above us diving in different directions Weve given them multiple targets but now well face them oneonone A hail of ice pellets strikes my skin bouncing off Tairns scales but hes forced to tuck his wings in tight to avoid damage My stomach launches into my throat as we freefall the valley floor rising up at us at an alarming rate Heat and energy threaten to devour every inch of my body and even my eyes feel like theyre on fire Oh fuck my signet is going to backlash against me during the games Ground now Tairn roars I slam my eyes shut throwing both mental feet onto the marble floor of the Archives and throwing up the walls around me only leaving entrances for Tairns torrent of power Andarna and access to Xaden and I immediately feel more in control When I open my eyes were ascending Tairns wings beating with so much force that I slide back in the saddle with every push Hes left the icewielding First Wing cadet in a dive behind us and I cringe as the dragon barely controls the descent banking in the opposite direction were headed Thats where theyre guarding the egg It has to be considering another three dragons have taken the place of the others at the edge of the cliff ready to launch Agreed Hold tight Tairn barely has a second to shout before a dragon flies out of the valley to the right and blasts a stream of fire at us Tairn I scream watching in horror as the flames barrel toward us Tairn banks taking the blast straight to his belly shielding me from all but the sizzling heat that blazes by What the actual fuck Andarna If something happens to her because First Wing is out for blood Fireproof remember I let out a shaky breath One worry down but the other dragon is on our heels opening its mouth and curling its tongue Tairn jerks and his tail swings catching the offending dragon in the side just below its wing The other dragon roars falling sideways losing altitude at an alarming rate But I dont focus on the descent Instead I use the time to scan the mountainside for the outpost I spied earlier My heartbeat quickens as I spot it peeking out from a ridge only one remaining dragon guarding it Xaden The egg is here I relay Already on my way Were twenty miles out The edge of panic lacing his tone puts a knot of fear in my throat which only grows when I see Deigh and Liam locked in battle above us with a familiar Orange ScorpiontailBaide Jack We have to help Liam On it Tairn accelerates and Andarna falls away Once I see her tuck into the mountainside where shell be safe I hunker down on Tairns neck giving him less wind resistance to fight as we climb faster than ever before Wind yanks at the halo braid of my hair the loosened strands whipping at my face as I keep my eyes locked on Deigh and Liam Baide snaps her tail at Deigh the venomous bulb perilously close to Deighs throat His scales are thicker than you think Its Liam whos in danger Tairn warns climbing higher Were almost there when Jack unsheathes his sword and jumps from Baides back to Deighs catching Liam by surprise as the dragons grapple close to the tower were approaching at breakneck speed Theres barely time for Liam to gain his feet before Jack thrusts the sword through his side Liam The scream tears from my throat as Jack kicks his boot into Liams stomach forcing Liams body off the bladeand Deigh No No No Liam falls his arms flailing as he plummets ahead of us Catch him I demand afraid we wont make it Deigh and Baide collide with the tower and I glimpse Jack rolling to safety on the highest turret his sadistic grin wide enough to see from here as Tairn changes course with a dramatic right roll Only the leather straps across my thighs keep me seated as we chase Liams tumbling body Tairns wings tucked in tight but the outcroppings are too close and were too high No My throat closes I refuse to lose him Not when hes dedicated so many months of his life to keeping me alive Failing isnt an option Its justnot Andarna I cry already throwing open the window in my mind to where her glittering gift lies in wait Do it she answers Focus on everything except you and Tairn Shes right Theres no point in me catching up to Liam if Tairn is frozen Do it I reach for the golden power and my back arches as it barrels down my spine flooding through my fingers and toes enveloping every cell in my body before blasting outward in a shock wave that passes over Tairn Suddenly were the only ones moving plunging through a windless sky toward Liams frozen body mere feet from the rugged outcropping of rocks below Heartbeats thats all we have My entire body trembles with the effort to hold it the power flowing from Andarna ebbing as Tairn extends his wings and claw snatching Liams body from midair and taking out the rocks with the force of his tail as we barely escape death ourselves Got him Time snaps back wind blasting me in the face as we climb turning tightly to avoid colliding with the ridgeline Andarna Safe Her voice is barely a whisper in my head Wrath and fury boil my blood as my eyes lock onto the figure on top of that tower This is the last time this asshole will come after my friends or me Feirge appears from below Rhiannons arms outstretched as they rise beneath us Tairn slows just enough to transfer Liam to her Hes alivehe has to be Its the only outcome Ill accept In my peripherals I see Cath and other dragons arrive from the north just as another squad launches from the cliff above Baide is airborne behind us racing toward her asshole of a rider who is still gloating on the top of that fucking tower Climb I order unsheathing a blade at my ribs and leaving one hand free to unsnap the buckles when its time You will not unseat yourself Tairn bellows at me as we surge forward leaving the smaller orange dragon behind us He swivels his head left blasting a stream of fire toward the line of First Wing dragons to warn them off and succeeding as we barrel past A growing power sizzles in my chest as I lock my gaze on Jack I can see the sick pleasure on his face as we fly closer the blood that drips from his sword Liams blood An enormous dragon appears on the horizon I dont need to look or even open my feelings to know its Xaden but I cant spare a moment for him Tairn is climbing faster than weve ever climbed and power is racing along my skin scorching my blood If this is it if my power is backlashing then Ill be damned if I dont take that asshole with me Tairn is fireproofbut not Jack Faster I shout my voice desperate with worry we wont make it in time Tairn charges the tower his wings beating faster and faster and I instinctually throw my hands forward as though I can project all this power lashing within me toward the enemy who just tried to kill my friend who has done his best to kill me at every opportunity That sizzle of magic grows to a lethal swirling vortex of energy and though my feet are still firmly grounded the power rises to a breaking point and the roof of my Archives disintegrates Power crackles above me swirls around me wraps along my feet below me I am the sky and the power of every storm that has ever been I am infinite A scream rips from my throat just as lightning splits the sky with a terrifying crack of thunder The bluish streak of silver death slams into the tower and sparks flare as it explodes in a blast of stone Tairn banks to avoid the blast and I pivot in the saddle Jack falls down the mountainside in an avalanche of rock that I know he cant survive From the way Baide cries beneath us she knows it too My hand trembles as I sheathe the clean dagger at my ribs The only blood to be found is on the rocks below though I look at my hands as though they should be covered in death Tairn roars with the unmistakable sound of pride Lightning wielder The death of a cadet is an inevitable yet acceptable tragedy This process thins the herd leaving only the strongest riders and as long as the cause of death does not break the Codex any rider involved in extinguishing anothers life shall not be punished Major Afendras Guide to the Riders QuadrantUnauthorized Edition CHAPTER TWENTYNINE We land in the flight field what feels like minutes later Or maybe its been a lifetime Im not sure The ground shakes as dragons arrive to the left and right the field quickly filling with celebrating riders from Fourth Wing and angry ones from First The dragons take off as soon as their riders dismount with the exception of Andarna who waits between Tairns forelegs as I fumble with the buckles Jack is dead I killed him Im the reason his parents will get a letter the reason his name will be etched into stone Across the field Garrick lifts the crystal egg above his head as Dain waves the flag and those in Fourth Wing cheer rushing toward the pair like theyre gods Tairns weight shifts beneath me as the last buckle slips through my fingers and I slide out of the saddle My head swims stress no doubt bringing on the dizzy spell that makes it hard to keep my balance as I make my way to his shoulder and dismount I stumble in the mud hitting my knees when I reach where Andarna lies between Tairns forelegs clearly exhausted Tell me Liam is alive Tell me it was worth it Deigh says that he lives The sword went through his side Tairn says Good Good Thats good Thank you Andarna I know how much that cost you I look up into her golden eyes and she blinks slowly back Worth it Nausea holds me in its grip and my mouth waters Killed him I killed him Damn Sorrengail Sawyer calls out Lightning Youve been holding out on us Lightning I used to take a life My stomach heaves and a dark shadow envelops me but its not Xaden Tairn has folded his wings over us closing out the world while I retch up everything Ive eaten today You did what was necessary Tairn says but it doesnt stop my stomach from clenching and tightening again trying its best to force up whats not even there You saved your friend Andarna adds Finally my stomach settles and I force myself to my feet dragging the back of my hand over my mouth You need to get some rest dont you Im proud youre mine Andarnas voice wavers the blinks of her eyes becoming slower Even if I need a bath Tairn draws back his wings and Andarna walks forward then launches into the sky with steady wingbeats toward the Vale I stare up at the saddle I need to get him out of this so he can rest too But all I can think is that I finally have a signet a real true signet and the first thing I did with it was kill a man Violet Dain appears on my left That was you with the lightning strike The one that took down the tower The one that killed Jack I nod thinking of all the times I aimed for the shoulder instead of the heart The poisons I used to incapacitate not murder I left Oren unconscious on the ground at Threshing and didnt even go for the throat when he invaded my room All because I didnt want to be a killer Ive never seen anything like it I dont think theres been a lightning wielder in more than a century He pauses Violet I killed him I whisper studying the central chest plate of the saddle That has to be where everything connects right He has to get out of this thing somehow Mom will be so proud to know Im just like the others now Just like her My empty belly turns over again and I retch like my body is trying to expel the guilt Shit He rubs his hand over my back Its all right Vi It stops sooner this time and Dain pulls me against his chest rocking gently as his hand makes soothing motions up and down my spine I killed him Why the hell is that all I can say Im a broken music box repeating the same melody over and over and everyone can see me Everyone knows I cant handle the consequences of my own signet I know I know He presses a kiss to the top of my head And if you dont want to use that kind of power again you dont have to Get the fuck away from her with that nonsense Xaden pushes Dains chest and tugs me out of his arms then grips my shoulders turning me to face him You killed Barlowe I nod Lightning Your signet is lightning isnt it He looks at me with such intensity as though my answer is the key to whatever he needs Yes His jaw flexes and his head bobs once I thought so but I wasnt sure until I saw you take that tower down He thought so What the hell does that even mean Listen to me Sorrengail He lifts one hand to stroke loose tendrils of hair behind my ear his touch surprisingly gentle The world is a better place without Barlowe in it We both know that Do I wish Id been the one to end his miserable life Absolutely But what you did will save countless others He was nothing more than a bully and was only going to get worse as he grew more powerful His dragon will choose another rider when shes ready Im glad hes dead I am glad you killed him I didnt mean to Its barely a whisper I was just so fucking mad and wed just caught Liam I thought my relic was backlashing finally My eyes widen It was close Xaden It was too close I had to do something Whatever you did is what kept him alive His thumb strokes over my cheek the motion completely at odds with his tone and his eyes flare just enough that I know hes aware of what I did I dont want this I blurt Rhiannon can move objects through space and Dain has retrocognition Hey Dain snaps You think I didnt know that already Xaden barks over his shoulder Kaori can bring his imagination to life and Sawyer can bend metal Mira can extend the wards Everyone has a signet that isnt just useful for battle Theyre tools for good in the world And what the hell am I Xaden Im a fucking weapon You dont have to use your power Vi Dain starts his voice soft and comforting Stop Fucking Coddling Her Xaden bites out every word at Dain She is not a child Shes a fullgrown woman A rider Start treating her like one and at least have the decency to give her the truth You think Melgren or any other generalto include her own motheris going to let her sit on a power like this Its not like she can hide it not the way she just demolished one of the practice forts You just want her to be like you Dain argues A coldblooded killer Soon youll be telling her that its all right you get used to the killing I inhale a sharp breath Xaden nails him with a glare The blood in my veins is as warm as yours Aetos and if its my job you want next year then youd better start understanding that you never get used to killing but you do understand that its necessary He turns back to me his dark gaze boring into mine This isnt primary school This is warand you heard me say it once before but the ugly truth those not on the front lines choose to forget is there are always body bags in war I start to shake my head but his eyes narrow on mine You might not like it might even loathe it but its power like yours that saves lives By killing people I cry If Sgaeyl is right and signets reflect who we are at our core then Im exactly as Xaden nicknamed meViolence By defeating invading armies before they get the chance to hurt civilians You want to keep Rhiannons nephew alive in that little border village This is how You want to keep Mira alive when shes behind enemy lines This Is How You are not just a weapon Sorrengail You are the weapon You train this ability own it and youll have the power to defend an entire kingdom He smooths back more windloosened tendrils of my hair behind my ears clearing my vision so I have no excuse but to see the honesty in his eyes When hes sure Im not going to argue further he looks to his side Rhiannon can you get her back to the citadel Absolutely Rhiannon hustles over Dain scoffs and walks toward the other squad leaders leaving us The saddle I start Tairn can get it off himself It was one of his many design stipulations Xaden turns to leave but pauses Thank you for saving Liam Hes important to me You dont have to thank I sigh at his back And hes already gone You two have the weirdest relationship Rhiannon says linking her arm with mine Were not in a relationship I look up at Tairn whos surprisingly held his tongue through whatever that was with Xaden and Dain Go Tairn urges But do not wallow in guilt Silver One Whatever you feel is natural Allow yourself to feel it but then let it go The wingleader made a valid point With a signet like that you are the best hope the kingdom has against the hordes of evil that seek to harm it Rest and I will see you tomorrow Ill get my own saddle off Youre most definitely in a relationship Rhiannon continues tugging me off the field I just cant figure out if its the oppositesattract partnership that has you two baring claws or the slow lethal burn of scalding sexual tension She glances sideways at me Now tell me how the hell you two moved that fast out there What do you mean When Liam was falling Feirge and I flew as fast as we could but I knew wed be too slow given our angle and speed and I thought you She shakes her head It just looked like you were high above him one second and had him in the next Ive never seen a dragon fly that fast Its like I blinked and missed it Now guilt bites into me for a whole other reason Rhiannon is my friend my closest one here if Im being honest about what Dain and I have become Of everyone she should know Do not feel guilt that you can not tell her This secret belongs to dragonkind not you Tairn warns No one has the right to risk our hatchlings Not even you Silver One Tairn is really fast I say in way of explanation Its not a lie but it isnt the full truth either And thank gods for it Zihnal must really love Liam cheating death twice today But it wasnt Liam who cheated death It was me And I cant help but wonder if somewhere on some plane of existence Malek sits on his throne angry that I stole a soul from his grasp But then again I gave him Jacks Of course it might have broken mine forever The wooden target in my room wobbles as one of my daggers sinks into the wood beside the last one I threw I might be angry with the world but at least my aim isnt off If I miss theres a good chance the blade is flying out the window considering where I have the target propped up on the wall I throw three more rapidfire and hit the throat of the personshaped target every single time Whats the point of going for shoulders anymore if Im already taking people out with bolts of lightning What was my restraint for With a flick of my wrist I send the next dagger soaring putting it straight through the figures forehead just as theres a knock at my door Its either Rhiannon asking for the tenth time if I want to talk about what happened today or its Liam I pause It cant be Liam checking to see if Im actually turned in for the night because Liam is still in the infirmary healing from the sword he took to the side Come in Who cares if Im in nothing but my dressing gown Its not like I cant strike an intruder dead with a knife Or lightning The door opens beside me but I dont bother looking as I throw another dagger That height That hint of dark hair I catch in my peripheral vision That incredible scent I dont even need to look fullymy body tells me its Xaden Then my body reminds me exactly what it feels like to have his mouth on mine and my stomach flutters Shit Im too on edge to deal with him or the way he makes me feel tonight Imagining thats me he asks shutting my door and leaning back against it folding his arms across his chest Then he does a doubletake his heated gaze roaming over my body Suddenly the spring breeze coming through the open window isnt enough to cool my skin not when hes looking at me like that My long braid swings across my back as I take another dagger off my dresser No But it was you about twenty minutes ago Who is it now He raises a brow crosses one ankle over the other No one you know With a flick of my wrist the next blade goes through the sternum Why are you here I glance his way just long enough to note that hes bathed and wearing our standard uniform instead of flight leathers and definitely not long enough to note how fucking good he looks Just once Id love to see him disheveled or unnerved anything outside that calm control he wears like armor Let me guess Since Liam is out of commission its your duty to lecture me about sleeping in plain cotton I didnt come to lecture you he says softly and I can feel the warmth of his gaze like a caress as it rakes over the thin black straps of my dressing gown But I can definitely see that youre not wearing your armor No one is going to be ridiculous enough to attack me now I take another dagger from the dresser my pile dwindling Not when I can kill them from fifty yards away Tapping the end of the razorsharp weapon I pivot slightly just enough to face him Do you think it works inside I mean how does someone wield lightning if theres no sky Keeping my eyes locked on his I fling the dagger at the target The satisfying sound of split wood tells me I hit true Fuck thats hotter than it should be He pulls in a deep breath I think thats something youll have to figure out His gaze drops to my mouth and his arms tense Youre not going to step in and say you can train me You can save me I click my tongue and have the absolutely ridiculous urge to run it up the lines of the relic on his neck tracing the intricate pattern How very unXaden of you I have no clue how to train a lightning wielder and from what I witnessed today you dont need saving Theres pure longing in his eyes as he scans the length of my body from my bare toes to the hemline that skirts my thighs over my breasts to my neck finally reaching my eyes Only from myself I mutter The things I think about doing to him when he looks at me like that would surely ruin me and tonight Im not sure I care Thats a dangerous combination So then why are you here Xaden Because I cant seem to stay away He sounds anything but pleased by the admission but my breath catches anyway Shouldnt you be out there celebrating Everyone else is We won a battle not a war He pushes off the door and takes a single step closing the distance between us and lifts my braid from over my shoulder slowly rubbing his thumb along the strands And I figured you might still be upset You told me to get over myself remember So why the fuck would you care if Im upset I fold my arms across my chest choosing anger over lust I told you that youd have to develop a stomach for killing I never said youd get over it He drops my braid I should though right I shake my head and retreat into the center of the room We spend three years here learning how to become killers promoting and praising those who do it best He doesnt even flinch just watches me in that observant infuriatingly calm way of his Im not mad that Jack is dead We both know hes wanted to kill me since Parapet and eventually he would have Im mad that him dying changes me I tap my chest right above my heart Dain told me that this place strips away the niceties to reveal who someone really is Not going to argue there He watches me as I begin to pace And I just keep thinking that when I was younger I asked my dad what would happen if I wanted to be a rider like Mom or Brennan and he told me that I wasnt like them That my path was different except this place has peeled away my civility my niceties and it turns out my power is more destructive than any of theirs I stop right in front of him and hold up my hands And its not like I can blame this power on Tairn not that I would Signets are based on the rider just fueled by the dragon which means this has always been there under the surface just waiting to be unleashed And to think A knot forms in my throat All this time I had this tiny driving hope that I would be like Brennan and that would be the twist in my little fable That my signet would be mending and I could put all the broken things back together But instead Im made to split them apart How many people will I kill with this His eyes soften As many as you choose Just because you gained power today doesnt mean you lost agency What is wrong with me I shake my head my hands clenching into fists Any other rider would be thrilled Even now I feel the power simmering just beneath my skin Youve never been like any other rider He moves closer but doesnt touch me Probably because you never wanted to be here Gods I want him to touch me to wipe away the ugliness of the day to make me feel something anything but this welling shame None of you wanted to be here I glance pointedly at the rebellion relic on his neck Youre all doing just fine He looks at me really looks and it feels like he sees entirely too much Most of us would burn this place to the ground if we had the option but every marked one wants to be here because its our only path for survival Its not the same for you You wanted a quiet life full of books and facts You wanted to record the battles not be in them There is nothing wrong with you You get to be angry that you killed a man today You get to be angry that man tried to kill your friend You get to feel however you want within these walls Hes close enough now that I can feel his body heat through the thin cotton of my dressing gown But not outside them Its not a question Were riders he says as if thats explanation enough He takes hold of my hands and brings them to his chest So do whatever you need to get it out You want to yell Yell at me You want to hit something Hit me I can take it Hitting him is the last thing I want to do and suddenly Im done fighting it Come on he whispers Show me what youve got I surge up on my toes and kiss him Though not forbidden cadets are strongly encouraged not to develop strong romantic attachments while studying in the quadrant for the efficiency of the unit Article Five Section Seven The Dragon Riders Codex CHAPTER THIRTY His body goes rigid for one beat two and then he spins us impossibly fast putting my back against the door jostling the frame Whoa He captures my wrists in one hand and holds them prisoner above my head Violet Xaden groans against my mouth The plea in his tone floods my veins with a whole different form of power Knowing hes just as affected by our attraction as I am is a rush This isnt what you want Its exactly what I want I counter I want to replace the anger with lust the death of the day with the pulsepounding assurance of my own life and I know hes capable of delivering all that and more You said to do whatever I need I arch my back pressing the tips of my breasts against his chest His breathing changes and theres a war in his eyes that Im determined to win Its time to stop dancing around this unbearable tension and break it He leans down his mouth only inches from mine And Im telling you that Im the last thing you need The barely leashed growl of his voice rumbles up through his chest and every nerve ending in my body flares to life Are you suggesting someone else My heart races as I chance calling his bluff Fuck no The unmistakable flare of jealousy narrows his eyes for a heartbeat before his hips pin mine to the door and my instant relief at his answer is replaced by a jolt of pure lust I can see that infamous control of his hovering on the edge balancing precariously on the point of a knife All he needs is one Little Push And Im about to shamelessly shove Good I tilt my head up to his and draw his bottom lip between mine sucking before gently nipping him with my teeth Because I only want you Xaden The words breach something within him and he gives Finally Our mouths collide and the kiss is hot and hard and completely out of our control Need streaks down my spine as he takes my ass in his hands and hauls me against his hips my back raking the ridges of the door behind me as I use it as leverage to push closer to his strength I wrap my legs around his waist and lock my ankles My dressing gown rises with the motion but I dont care not with the allconsuming way hes kissing me The caress of his mouth and the strokes of his wicked tongue steal every logical thought and my world narrows to this kiss this minute this man Mine In this moment Xaden Riorson is mine Or maybe Im his Who fucking cares as long as he keeps kissing me Heat floods my body in an addictive rush setting every inch of my skin aflame as his mouth slides down my neck in a sensual assault that makes me moan Gods he says against my throat and then were moving Wood scrapes the floor and crashes before my ass hits the desk and my ankles fall from the small of his back when he leans over me spearing his fingers through my hair at the nape of my neck as he takes my mouth again I kiss him back with a hunger Ive only known with him My hands fly back to brace my weight knocking anything and everything out of my way sending whatever careening to the floor The clock stops ticking Youll hate me in the morning You Dont Really Want This He punctuates each word with a kiss along my jaw making his way to my ear He bites the lobe and my core liquefies going molten Stop telling me what I want I breathe raggedly and thread my fingers through the short strands of his hair tilt my head giving him better access He takes it working his way down my neck to where it curves into my shoulder Fuck that feels good Every touch of his mouth to my heated skin is flame to kindling and I suck in a sharp breath when he lingers on a sensitive spot taking his time But then he stills again his breath hot and wet against the side of my neck My brow furrows with an unwelcome thought Unless you dont want me Does this feel like I dont want you He takes my hand and slides it between our bodies and my fingers curl around his length through his leathers I whimper with pure want at the feel of how hard he is for me I always fucking want you He groans as I squeeze Then he lifts his head seizes my gaze with his and I recognize the wild need in those goldflecked depths It mirrors my own You walk into a room and I cant look away I get anywhere near you and this is what happens Instantly hard Fucking hell I can barely think when youre around He rocks his hips into my hand and my grip tightens along with my stomach Wanting you is not the problem here Then what is Im trying to do the honorable thing and not take advantage of you after youve had a shit day His jaw flexes I smile and kiss the side of his mouth Its always a shit day around here And its not taking advantage when Im askingmy teeth nip at his lipscorrection begging you to make my day better Violet He says my name like a warning as if hes something I should be wary of Violet He only says my name when its just the two of us when all the walls and the pretenses fall away and gods if I dont want to hear it again and again just like that I dont want to think Xaden I just want to feel I release him One tug of the ribbon is all it takes to unravel the long loose braid of my hair and I run my fingers through the mass His eyes darken and I know Ive won Fuck me this hair he says then hovers his mouth over mine And this mouth All I ever want to do is kiss you even when you piss me off So kiss me I arch into him and claim his lips kissing him like this might be the only time Ill get the chance This kind of desperation isnt natural its a wildfire thats likely to burn us both to the ground if we let it The kiss is blatantly deliciously carnal and I melt against him matching every thrust of his tongue with mine He tastes like mint and Xaden and I cant get enough Hes the worst kind of addiction dangerous and impossible to sate Tell me to stop he whispers his thumb skimming the hypersensitive skin of my inner thigh Dont stop Ill die if he does Fuck Violet he groans slipping his hand between my thighs Never mind That is how I want him to say my name from now on Just like that He glides the fabric of my underwear across my clit and my back arches at the burst of pleasure that radiates through my body so sweet I can taste it He captures my mouth with his again in a hungry assault his tongue sliding against mine as his fingers stroke me through the fabric expertly using it for friction I try to rock my hips against his hand for more but my feet dangle off the desk robbing me of leverage I can only have what he decides to give Touch me I demand my fingernails biting into the back of his strong neck desire pounding through me like a drumbeat His voice is ragged against my mouth If I get my hands on you really honestly get my hands on you I dont know if Ill be able to stop He would I know it in my soul Thats why I trust him with my body My heart It isnt playing into this decision Stop being so fucking honorable and fuck me Xaden His eyes flare and then he kisses me like Im the air hes been missing like his life depends on it and I think mine just might His fingers slide under my underwear and stroke my slickened core and a moan tumbles from my lips His touch is electric So damned soft He kisses me deeply as his fingers touch and tease making that sweet coil of pleasure tighten in my core I dig my nails into his shoulder my back arching as he makes tighter and tighter circles against my swollen clit I bet you taste just as good as you feel Pleasure shudders through me a living breathing fire beneath my skin More Its all Im capable of saying demanding as my skin flushes and my pulse skyrockets Im going to combust to burst into flames and all I can do is whimper against his mouth as he slides one finger inside me My muscles clench around him and he works in a second Youre so fucking hot His voice drops sounding like its been scraped over coals It might damn us both but I cant wait to feel you come around my cock Oh gods That mouth I throw my hands back against the wall for leverage knocking something loose as my hips roll Something shatters on the floor to the left as I ride his thrusting fingers He curls them against my inner walls and I gasp my thighs locking around his leatherclad hips And when he uses his thumb to stroke my clit the friction and pressure push me to the edge of mindless bliss I cry out and he covers the sound with his mouth kissing with devious strokes of his tongue that match the movement of his fingers within me Power surges rippling through my bones and I grab onto Xaden even harder surprised at the unexpected rush of crackling energy Look at you Youre fucking beautiful Violet Let go for me His words curl around my mind his mouth fused to mine and the intimacy of it pushes me to the limit of pleasure and then right over it He swallows my cry as my back bows the first wave of my orgasm washing over me releasing that tight coil of tension in a burst of sparks at the edge of my vision breaking me into a million scattered stars Lightning strikes outside my window flashing light through the room again and again as he strokes me with an expertise that kicks the first climax into a second Xaden I moan as the pleasure ebbs and flares again He grins and slides his fingers from my body and Im nothing but ragged breaths and raw hunger as I reach for his shirt I want it off now He accommodates my urgency ripping off the fabric and then were kissing again all swirling tongues and roaming hands The feel of his skin under my fingertips is divine impossibly soft over yards of hard muscle I trace the lines of his back memorizing the dips and hollows as sinew ripples with every move he makes I need you now I gasp and reach for the buttons of his leathers You know what youre saying he asks as I shove the fabricand any cloth beneathpast his hips freeing the thick length of his cock Its hot and hard in my hand and the moan that rips from his lips makes me feel invincible Im asking you to fuck me I arch up and kiss him He groans dragging my hips to the edge of the desk then working my underwear down my legs leaving me bare My pulse skyrockets I take the fertility suppressant Of course we both do The last thing anyone wants are little quadrant babies running around But its better said than sorry Same He grips my hips lifting me for a better angle and the head of his cock rubs against my clit I gasp and his eyes lock with mine The hunger I see etched in every tense line of his body is my undoing I dont care if it damns us I need him No more holding back Not anymore I reach between us guiding the head of his cock to my entrance but this position is shit Hes considerably taller than the desk and if I wasnt so desperate for him Id laugh but I am I arch but it doesnt help Every second we wait feels like it stretches on for a decade Fucking desk he swears My thoughts exactly His biceps flex as he lifts me by the backs of my thighs and I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist my dressing gown caught between us as he pivots Our mouths meet in a ravenous kiss as my back hits the armoire but I barely blink too consumed with the stroke of his tongue the feel of him between my thighs Shit Are you all right he asks Im fine You wont break me He pushes inside that first tight inch of me and I gasp at the fit the stretch More Im too busy kissing him to speak I need all of you Youre going to be the death of me Violet Whatevers left of his control slips and he takes me completely with one hard thrust I moan into the kiss Deep Hes so fucking deep that I feel him everywhere Tell me youre all right Hes already moving thank gods Im perfect Better than perfect Power blazes beneath my skin again buzzing in wordless frenzied demand You feel so fucking good He slams back into me again and again as he sets a brutal steady pace his mouth sliding down my neck as his hand rises to cup my breast I cant even think around the maddening pleasure as my back pounds the armoire door with every thrust filling the room with the sound of our straining bodies and creaking wood Every stroke is better than the last My breaths stutter Fuck Im never going to get enough of you am I he says his face buried in my neck as I arch into him Shut up and fuck me Riorson Tomorrow is soon enough for regrets Reaching up I grasp the top edge of the armoire with one hand so I can rock back with more force meeting the drive of his hips taking him deeper harder He drags one of my nightgowns straps off my shoulder and the cool night air kisses the hardened peak of my nipple a heartbeat before his hot mouth covers it The sensations spiral spinning and coiling forming a tight knot of pleasure so deep within me the tension is sublimely unbearable The armoire door groans then splinters off the hinges and Xadens shadows whip out protecting me as the frame snaps and wood crashes around us My power flares rising in answer to his sizzling beneath my skin as I grab ahold of his shoulders my mouth finding his Theres no stopping We cant stop Fuck he curses as he takes me over and over never stopping turning us again so theres cloth against my back But its not the bed Its the curtains shoved to the side of the window Energy crackles again as our mouths meet and still he drives on winding that knot inside me painfully tighter with every movement And the powerits too much Its burning me heating my blood with the need for release Xaden I cry out simultaneously writhing yet holding on to him like hes the only thing anchoring me to the earth Ive got you Violet he promises his breath ragged pants against my lips Let it out Lightning whips through me flashing so bright that my eyes slam shut Heat flares above me as thunder cracks immediately And I smell smoke Shit Xadens power fills the room eclipsing what light we had and the curtain falls but were moving before the charred fabric can so much as touch my skin That knot of pleasure builds to a breaking point as he takes me to the floor and finally I have all of his weight as he drives into me Shadows fall away and the sight of him above me his dark gaze locked on mine in intense concentration is the most beautiful sight Ive ever seen So Very Beautiful I punctate each word with a kiss He draws back his eyes searching mine for a heartbeat or two before he devastates me with another kiss that has me straining for more rocking my hips against his This man kisses with his whole body rolling his hips in time with the thrust of his tongue bracing just enough of his weight so I can breathe while stroking his chest over my hypersensitive nipples He keeps me on the same edge hes riding and I dont know how much longer I can take it before I set this entire room on fire I needI need My frantic eyes search his Where are my words I know He claims my mouth again and reaches between us using those talented fingers to stroke me into another orgasm and light flashes again followed by thunder and darkness as I come apart under him Pleasure takes me in waves rolling through me again and again until all I can do is clutch Xadens shoulders and ride it out in blissful surrender Beautiful he whispers The second I come down his rhythm breaks and he presses my knee up toward my chest and takes me even deeper I rock my hips up to meet his sweat beading on our skin as I watch him unravel with rapt fascination I love his loss of control just as much as I fear my own and when I swirl my hips he groans arching his neck as he thrusts once Twice On the third he shouts then shudders within me and his power lashes out in streaks of shadows the force splitting the wooden target on the other side of the window Pieces fly and Xaden throws out another wave of darkness that lasts just long enough to shield us from the debris Then the shadows retreat and daggers clatter to the ground behind me He looks as shocked and as enthralled as I feel as we lay there staring at each other our chests heaving in the aftermath of what can only be described as complete and utter madness Ive never lost control like that he says bracing his weight on one arm and brushing my hair back from my face with the other The move is so gentle so at odds with what weve just experienced that I cant help but blink then smile Me neither The smile morphs into a fullout grin Not that Ive ever had power to lose control of before He laughs and rolls us to his side keeping me close and cushioning my head with his biceps I sniff at the smoke in the air Did I Set the curtains on fire He lifts a brow Yes Oh I cant find it in me to be embarrassed so I brush the backs of my fingers across the stubble along his jaw And you put it out Yes Right before I destroyed your throwing target He grimaces Ill get you a new one I glance over at the armoire And we Yep He lifts his brows And Im pretty sure you need a new chair too That was I didnt even get the mans pants entirely off and my dressing gown is haphazardly hanging from one shoulder Frighteningly perfect He cups the side of my face We should get you cleaned up and to sleep We can worry aboutyour room tomorrow Ironically your bed is the only thing we didnt wreck I sit up to confirm that the bed made it and Xaden does the same next to me leaning forward Immediately I lose interest in everything but the muscled lines of his back and the navyblue relic Sgaeyl transferred to him I reach out and trace the dragon relic on his back my fingers lingering on the raised silver scars and he stiffens Theyre all short thin lines too precise to be a whip no rhyme or reason to their pattern but never intersecting What happened I whisper holding my breath You really dont want to know Hes tense but doesnt move away from my touch I do They dont look accidental Someone hurt him deliberately maliciously and it makes me want to hunt the person down and do the same to them His jaw flexes as he looks over his shoulder and his eyes meet mine I bite my lip knowing this moment can go either way He can shut me out like always or he can actually let me in Theres a lot of them I murmur dragging my fingers down his spine A hundred and seven He looks away That number makes my stomach lurch and then my hand pauses A hundred and seven Thats the number Liam mentioned Thats how many kids under the age of majority carry the rebellion relic Yeah I shift so I can see his face What happened Xaden He brushes my hair back and the look that passes over his face is so close to tender that it makes my heart stutter I saw the opportunity to make a deal he says softly And I took it What kind of deal leaves you with scars like that Conflict rages in his eyes but then he sighs The kind where I take personal responsibility for the loyalty of the hundred and seven kids the rebellions leaders left behind and in return were allowed to fight for our lives in the Riders Quadrant instead of being put to death like our parents He averts his gaze I chose the chance of death over the certainty The cruelty of the offer and the sacrifice he made to save the others hits like a physical blow I cradle his cheek and guide his face back to mine So if any of them betray Navarre I lift my brows Then my life is forfeit The scars are a reminder Its why Liam says he owes him everything Im so sorry that happened to you Especially when he wasnt the one who led the rebellion He looks at me like he sees into the very depths of who I am You have nothing to apologize for I grab his hand as he moves to stand Stay I shouldnt Two lines appear between his brows as he searches my eyes People will talk When did I ever give you the impression that I give a fuck what people think I use his earlier words against him and sit up curling my hand around the section of his neck that bears his relic Stay with me Xaden Dont make me beg We both know this is a bad idea Then its our bad idea His shoulders dip and I know Ive won Hes mine for the night We take turns sneaking out long enough to clean up and then he slides into bed behind me Only within these walls he says quietly and I understand what he means Only within these walls I agree Its not like were in a relationship or anything That would bedisastrous given the chain of command Were riders after all I just dont trust my temper if anyone says I brush a kiss over his mouth silencing him I know what youre saying Itssweet He nips at my skin Im not sweet Please dont mistake any part of me for soft or kind That will only get you hurt and whatever you do He buries his face in my neck inhaling deeply Dont fall for me I stroke my hand over his marked arm and pray thats not exactly what Im doing This overwhelming juxtaposition of longing and satisfaction in my chest has to be the aftereffects of coming not once but three times right It cant be more Violence I look out my window at the infinite black sky and change the topic my eyelids growing heavier by the second Why did you guess I could wield lightning He stretches just enough to tuck my head under his chin I thought you did it the first night Tairn channeled power to you but I wasnt sure so I didnt say anything Really I blink thinking back but my brain is full of a pleasant dull hum as sleep fights to pull me under When My eyes drift shut His arms tighten around me as he tucks me closer the backs of my thighs pressed tight against his pants as I start to drift off The first time you kissed me When I wake Xaden is gone but thats not exactly a surprise Him staying the night to begin with Now that was the shocker Finding a jar on my nightstand with a handful of spring violets My heart swells Im in so much fucking trouble He even moved all the debris to a pile in the corner which means he must have used his shadows while I was sleeping because I didnt hear a thing Im still exhausted but I dress and pin my hair up quickly noting the sun has already risen With Liam in the infirmary Ill be solo for my Archives trip today but I might be able to sneak in to see him on the way back Im lacing my boots when theres a knock at my door You have to be kidding I say loudly enough for the knocker to hear Just because Liam is healing doesnt mean I need anotherI wrench the door open and stumble over the last wordbodyguard Professor Carr stands in my hallway his hair standing on end as he looks at me with scientific appraisal then lifts his eyebrows as he stares past me into the wreckage of my room We have work to do I have Archives duty I argue He snorts Youre off Archives duty until we can be sure youre not going to burn the place down Lightning and paper dont mix well Trust me Sorrengail the scribes arent going to want you anywhere near their precious books and from the looks of it you cant even control your powers in your sleep I try to ignore the sting of his words since hes far off but end up following him down the hall when he leaves Where are we going Somewhere you wont start a forest fire he says without looking back Twenty minutes later were in the flight field and to my surprise Tairn is saddled How the hell did you do that He chuffs in indignation As if Id let them design something I couldnt figure out how to get on myself Remember where you get your power from Silver One Hows Andarna I ask as Professor Carr thrusts a satchel into my hands What is this for Sleeping but shes fine Tairn promises Breakfast Carr answers With all the wielding youre about to do youre going to need it He climbs onto his Orange Daggertail and after I mount Tairn and strap in were airborne The bite of spring wind stings my cheeks as we fly deep into the mountain range and Im thankful I dressed in flight leathers this morning thinking Id have a session before lunch We land almost a half hour later high above the tree line I shiver and rub my arms to fight off the low temperatures that come with high altitude Dont worry You wont be cold for long Carr assures dismounting and pulling a small tome from his pocket According to what I read last night this particular ability has the power to overheat your system hence He gestures around us Plus theres not much to burn up here is there And no witnesses if he decides to break my neck either I glance at him quickly before looking away undoing the buckles of my saddle then sliding down Tairns foreleg Dont leave me Never Ill burn him alive before he takes a single step toward you Exactly He studies me carefully and I avoid meeting his eyes as I check the wrap on my knee to make sure it hasnt slipped under my leathers Its always intriguing to me how nature finds the balance Im not sure I know what you mean Professor This kind of power found in one so He sighs Would you not call yourself fragile I am who I am I bristle Ive never given this particular professor any reason to think of me as different Its not an insult cadet He shrugs looking at the saddle Its a balance In the course of my duties Ive found a correlation of sorts that keeps a system of checks on power Yours seems to be your body A growl rumbles in Tairns chest as he edges Carrs smaller dragon out of his space Your dragon doesnt trust me Carr states like its an academic problem to be solved And considering hes the most powerful of them in the quadrant at the moment But not the Continent Tairn admits that means you dont trust me either Cadet Sorrengail He holds my gaze and the mountaintop wind makes his white hair dance like feathers Why is that No point lying Other than you calling me frail I stay at the base of Tairns foreleg ready to mount if necessary I was there the day you killed Jeremiah His signet manifested and you snapped his neck like a twig in front of all of us Carr tilts his head in thought Yes well he was in a considerable amount of panic and its widely known that inntinnsics arent allowed to live I ended his suffering before he could see the end coming Ill never understand why mindreading is a death sentence I place my hand on Tairns leg like I can absorb his strength even though I already feel it flowing through me Because knowledge is power As a generals daughter you should know that We cant have someone walking around with unfettered access to classified material Theyre a security risk to the entire kingdom And yet Dain is living Because Aetos will be useful to them as long as they can keep him under their control Tairn blasts a puff of steam over my head and the Orange Daggertail backs up even more His power is also limited to touch so more controllable Now you dont have to trust me and you can even wield from your seat on your dragon if you like but I hope you believe me when I tell you that I have no plans on killing you Cadet Sorrengail Losing an asset like you would be a tragedy for the war effort An asset And the fact that you bonded Tairn makes you and Riorson the most coveted pair of riders this kingdom has seen in far too long If I could offer a piece of advice His eyes narrow Please do At least hes brutally honest so I know where I stand with him Keep your loyalties clear You and Riorson both have exceptional lethal power that any rider would be envious of But together His bushy brows furrow You would be a formidable enemy who command could simply not afford to let exist Do you understand what Im saying His voice softens Navarre is my home Professor I will give my life to defend it just like every Sorrengail who has ridden before me Excellent He nods Now lets get to work The sooner you can contain the lightning the sooner we can both stop freezing our asses off Good point I look out over the range You just want me to I gesture to the mountains around us Preferably anywhere but right here yes I stare out at the mountains in the distance Im not really sure what I did to call it before It was anemotional reaction And what happened last night definitely isnt up for discussion Interesting He jots something down in his notebook with a piece of charcoal Youve wielded lightning besides yesterdays display during the War Games I debate keeping my answer to myself but my silence isnt going to help A few times And both times were the result of emotional reactions Tairn snorts and I smack his foreleg with the back of my hand Yes Well then start there Ground in your power and try to feel whatever it was you were feeling He goes back to his notebook Should I get the wingleader Tairn flatout laughs in my head Shut up I ground both feet in my Archives and power flows around me through me Andarnas golden light is there too but its softened from having been drained yesterday and high above me swirl the inkyblack shadows I know represent the connection to Xaden Problems Xaden asks as if he feels my inquiry And what are you doing so far away Training with Carr My cheeks heat at the sound of his low voice And how do you know how far away I am anyway Get stronger in wielding and youll be able to do it too Theres nowhere in existence you could go that I wouldnt find you Violence The promise should be a threat but its not Its too damned comforting for that Right now Id settle for wielding some lightning Carr is staring at me and its about to get really fucking awkward if I cant figure out how Images ofme flood my mind Its last night except Im somehow seeing it through Xadens eyes feeling the unmistakable burn of insatiable desire My control slipsno its Xadens control slipping as I moan beneath him my hips riding his hand my nails biting into his skin with a pain that borders on pleasure as I writhe Gods I neednohe needs me His hunger walks the line of starvation to know my touch my taste the feel of Power floods my entire system crackling along my skin and light flashes behind my closed eyes The images stop and my feelings are once again my own And fuck if Im not so turned on that I have to shift my weight to ease the ache between my thighs Good job Professor Carr nods jotting something down I cant believe you just did that Youre welcome My cheeks are flaming hot as I lift the backs of my hands to my skin See I told you Carr lifts the notebook The last lightning wielder said it made them overheat Now do it again Tairn chortles Not a single fucking word out of you I warn This time I focus on the feeling of the power rush and not what got it there opening every sense and letting whitehot energy course through me gathering to a breaking point Then I release it and lightning strikes more than a mile away Well look at that I am a certified badass Maybe you could work at aiming it this time Professor Carr peers over his notebook Just remember not to exhaust the physical strength with which you control the power No one wants to see you burn out A power like Tairns will eat you alive if you cant contain it Lightning strikes five more times before Im exhausted and none of it hits where I was aiming This is going to be harder than I thought July first the anniversary of the Battle of Aretia is hereby proclaimed Reunification Day and will be celebrated throughout Navarre on this date every year to honor the lives lost during the war to save our kingdom from separatists and those saved by the Treaty of Aretia Royal Proclamation of King Tauri the Wise CHAPTER THIRTYONE Theres a knock at my door as I take an armful of clothes from the skeletal remains of what used to be my armoire Come in I call out dumping them on the bed The door opens and Xaden walks in his hair windblown like hes just come from the flight field and my pulse jumps I just wanted he starts then pauses surveying the wreckage of my room from last night Somehow Id convinced myself today that we hadnt done that much damage but Yeah its He looks at me and we both crack a smile Look this doesnt have to be awkward or anything I shrug trying to ease the tension Were both adults His scarred brow rises Good because I wasnt going to make it that way But the least I can do is help you clean up His attention shifts to the armoire and he winces I swear it didnt look quite that ruined in the darkness when I left this morning Turns out you set more than a few trees on fire last night too Took two water wielders to get them out My cheeks heat You took off early I try to make my tone as nonchalant as possible as I walk toward my deskwhich miraculously survivedand bend down to gather a few of my books wed knocked to the floor I had a leadership meeting and needed to get an early start His arm brushes against mine as he leans down and picks up my favorite book of fables the one Mira slipped into my rucksack once wed gotten back to Montserrat that night Oh My chest lightens That makes perfect sense I stand putting my texts on the desk So it wasnt because I snore or anything No A corner of his mouth rises How did training with Carr go Nice subject change I can wield but I cant aim and its completely exhausting My mouth purses thinking back to the first strike I wielded You know you were kind of an asshole on the flight field yesterday His grip tightens on the book Yes I told you what I thought you needed to hear to get through the moment I know you dont like other people to see you vulnerable and you Were vulnerable I finish He nods If it makes you feel better I couldnt keep anything down after the first time I killed anyone either I dont think less of you for having a reaction like that Just means you still have your humanity So do you I say gently taking the book from him Thats debatable Says the man who has one hundred and seven scars on his back Its not Not to me He looks away and I know hes going to have his defenses up any second now Tell me something real I say desperate to keep him with me Like what he asks just like he did before when we were flying when he left me sitting on that mountain when I had the nerve to ask about his scars Like My mind races looking for something to ask Like where you went the night I found you in the courtyard His brow furrows Youre going to have to be more specific than that Thirdyears get sent away all the time You had Bodhi with you It was right before the Gauntlet I nervously run my tongue over my lower lip Oh He picks up another book and sets it on the desk clearly stalling while he decides whether or not hell open up to me I would never tell anyone anything you tell me I promise I hope you know that I know You never told a soul about what you saw under the tree last fall He rubs the back of his neck Athebyne You cant know why or ask anything else but thats where we were Oh That definitely wasnt what I expected but not out of the ordinary for cadets to run something to an outpost Thank you for telling me I move to put the book back and see that the binding is definitely worse for wear after we knocked the antique tome off the desk last night Damn I open the back cover and see that its split at the binding Something is peeking out What is that Xaden asks looking over my shoulder Not sure Balancing the heavy book with one hand I tug what looks to be a stiff piece of parchment free from where its been tucked behind the binding Gravity shifts as I recognize my fathers handwriting and its dated just a few months before his death My Violet By the time you find this youll most likely be in the Scribe Quadrant Remember that folklore is passed from one generation to the next to teach us about our past If we lose it we lose the links to our past It only takes one desperate generation to change historyeven erase it I know youll make the right choice when the time comes You have always been the best of both your mother and me Love Dad My brow furrows and I pass the letter to Xaden flipping through the book The tales are all familiar and I can still hear my fathers voice reading every word as if I were still a child curled on his lap after a long day Thats cryptic Xaden remarks He got a littlecryptic in the years after Brennan died I admit softly Losing my brother made my father even more reclusive I only really got to spend time with him because I was always in the Archives studying to be a scribe The pages flutter as I flip through stories of an ancient kingdom that spanned from ocean to ocean and a Great War among three brothers who fought to control the magic in this mystical land Some of the fables tell stories of the first riders who learned to bond with dragons and how those bonds could turn on the rider if they tried to consume too much power Others talk of a great evil that spread across the land as man became corrupted by dark magic and turned into creatures known as venin who created flocks of winged creatures called wyvern and scourged the land of all magic in the thirst for more power Another talks about the dangers of wielding power from the ground instead of the skies as one could easily start drawing magic from the earth and eventually be driven mad One of the purposes of the fables is to teach children about the dangers of too much power No one wants to become a venin theyre the monsters that hide beneath our beds when we have nightmares And we certainly never want to try to control magic without a dragon to ground us But thats all they are childrens bedtime stories So why did my dad leave me this cryptic noteand hide it inside the book What do you think he was trying to tell you Xaden asks I dont know Every fable in this book is about how too much power corrupts so maybe he felt someone in leadership was corrupt I glance up at Xaden and joke I certainly wouldnt be surprised if General Melgren ripped a mask off one day and revealed he was a terrifying venin That man has always given me the creeps Xaden chuckles Well lets hope not that My dad used to say venin were biding their time in the Barrens and one day were coming to get usif we didnt eat our vegetables He glances out the window to his left and I know hes remembering his father He said one day there would be no magic left in the kingdom if we werent careful Im sorry I start but when he tenses I decide a subject change is what he really needs So which mess should we tackle first I have a better idea of how to spend our night he says as he puts another pile of clothes on my bed Oh I glance over and catch his eyes darkening as he stares at my mouth My pulse immediately quickens the thought of touching him sending a burst of energy through me Dont fall for me His words from last night cut a sharp contrast to the way hes looking at me now I take a step backward You said not to fall for you Did you change your mind Absolutely not His jaw tenses Right I dont expect that to hurt as much as it does which is part of the problem Im already too emotionally involved to separate out the sex no matter how phenomenal it is Heres the thing I dont think I can separate sex from emotion when it comes to you Well shit now Ive said it Were already too close for that and if we hook up again Im going to eventually fall for you My heart pounds at the rushed confession waiting for his response You wont Something akin to panic flares in his eyes and he crosses his arms I swear I can actually see the man building his defenses against his own feelings You dont really know me Not at my core And whose fault is that I know enough I argue softly And wed have all the time in the world to figure it out if youd stop acting like such an emotional chickenshit and just admit that youre going to fall for me too if we keep this up Theres no way he would have designed that saddle spent all that time training me to fight and fly if he didnt feel something Hes going to have to fight for this too or it will never work I have absolutely no intention of falling for you Sorrengail His eyes narrow and he enunciates every word like I could possibly take that any other way Fuck That He let me in He told me about his scars He had an arsenal crafted for me He cares Hes just as wrapped up in this as I am even if hes shitty at showing it Ouch I wince Well its apparent that youre not ready to admit where this is going So yeah I think its best we agree that this was just a onetime thing I force my shoulders to shrug We both needed to blow off some steam and we did right Right he agrees apprehension lining his forehead So the next time I see you Ill just act as cool as you are right now and pretend that Im not remembering what it feels like to have you sliding inside me Warm and hard He really does have an incredible body but he doesnt get to dictate what I do with my heart He stalks forward with a smirk his gaze warming every inch of my body And Ill just pretend that Im not remembering the feel of your soft thighs around my hips or those breathy little sounds you make right before you come His teeth rake over his lower lip and it takes all my willpower not to suck that lip into my mouth And Ill ignore the memory of your hands biting into my hips pinning me to the armoire so you could take me deeper and your mouth on my throat Easy My lips part as I retreat my heart jumping in the best way when he follows backing me against the wall His hand rests next to my head as he leans into my space his lips curving into a half smile Then I guess Ill ignore the memory of how hot and slick you feel around my cock and how you cry out for more until all I can think about is how to push every physical limit to be exactly what you need Shit Hes better at this game than I am Heat flushes my skin I want him closer I want exactly what I had last night But I want more His breath hits my lips in ragged pants and Im in no better condition Fuck it I can have him right I can take exactly what hes offering and enjoy every single minute We can shred every piece of furniture in this room and then move to his But where will that leave us in the morning Right here both wanting and only one of us brave enough to take and I deserve more than a relationship thats only on his terms You want me I put my hand on his chest and feel his heart pounding And I know that scares you even though I want you just as badly He stiffens But heres the thing I hold his gaze knowing he could bolt at any second You dont get to dictate how I feel You might give the orders out there but not in here You dont get to tell me we can fuck but I cant fall for you Thats not fair You can only respect what I choose to do So were not doing this again until I want to risk my heart And if I fall then thats my problem not yours Youre not responsible for my choices His jaw clenches once Twice And then he pushes off the wall giving me space I think thats for the best Im graduating soon and who knows where Ill end up Besides you and I are chained together because of Sgaeyl and Tairn which complicateseverything He retreats one step at a time the distance more than just physical Besides with all that pretending Im sure well eventually forget last night ever happened The way were looking at each other tells me neither of us is ever going to forget And he can avoid it all he wants but were going to end up right here time and again until hes willing to recognize what this is Because if theres one thing I know for certain its that Im going to fall for this manif I havent alreadyand hes halfway there too whether he realizes it or not Turning my back on him I walk to the shattered halves of my throwing target and pick them up before heading back across my room I never figured you for a liar Xaden I shove the halves at his chest You can get me a new one when youre ready to come to your senses Then well blow off some steam I throw the aggravating man out Did you hear that King Tauri is celebrating Reunification Day here Sawyer asks as he swings his leg over the bench beside me at lunch Really I attack my roasted chicken with zeal Since Ive been training every day with Carr my appetite somewhat resembles a bottomless pit At least he only drags me to that mountaintop for an hour a day but still by the time breakfast comes Im ravenous After a month I still cant aim lightning for shit But Im up to about twenty strikes an hour so thats an improvement Glancing down the tables I catch Xadens eye as he eats with the leadership on the dais He looks scrumptious this morning Even the broody little cloud that follows him everywhere has a certain appeal as he rolls his eyes at something Garrick says Dont look at me like that Like what I arch an eyebrow His gaze flashes to mine Like youre thinking about the sparring gym last night Well duh Rhiannon says across from me Thats why Devera has about five hundred black dress uniforms in commons right now Where the king travels so does the party Well now that you mention it My tongue flicks over my lower lip remembering how his hips pinned mine to the mat after everyone had left for the night How close we both came to giving in to the pulsing need between us His jaw flexes and his grip tightens on his fork Seriously I cant think when you look at me like that Really I figured those were for graduation Ridoc questions Imogen scoffs Like anyone dresses up for graduation Its basically a giant formation where Panchek says Look you lived Good job Come get your assignments and then pack your shit and leave Everyone laughs at her spoton imitation Youre the one with the ridiculous rule about not falling for each other I remind him Youre still looking He forces his attention back to his plate You make it hard to look away I miss his mouth on my skin the feel of his body pressed against mine I miss the look on his face when he watched me come undone But I miss the feeling of him curled around me in sleep more Im over here keeping my hands and memories to myself because you asked me to and youre fucking me with your eyes Thats not playing fair I drop my fork and everyone at the table turns to stare You all right over there Rhiannon asks her eyebrows rising Yep I nod ignoring the flush of heat creeping up my neck Im great Liam sets his glass down and glances between Xaden and me shaking his head as he fights a smile Of course he knows whats going on Hed have to be completely oblivious not to considering he helped Xaden and Garrick move in the new armoire Told you to stop staring Theres laughter in his voice but his face is as expressionless as ever I tap my fork on my plate in pure frustration You know what Fuck this Two can play at this game If youd just man up and admit theres something between us I would strip down to my skin so you could see every single inch of me And once I had you begging Id drop down to my knees undo those flight leathers youre wearing and wrap my lips around Xaden chokes Every head in the dining hall turns his way and Garrick pounds on his back until Xaden waves him off taking a drink of his water I grin which earns me about six looks of confusion from our table and one set of rolled eyes from Liam Youre going to be the death of me Were only ten days away from graduation and Im counting every single one of them Thats when well find out how far Xaden is being sent from Basgiath Most brandnew lieutenants are given midland posts manning the forts along the roads that lead to the border outposts but someone with Xadens power I dont even want to think about how far hell be Or why he still hasnt admitted theres something between us Or even hinted that at least he didnt regret that one night Id take that Dont fall for me I feel a familiar prickle along my scalp and I know Xaden has filed into the Battle Brief room with the rest of the remaining cadets and leadership Professor Devera jumps right into todays brief but I find it difficult to pay attention Today marks six years since Brennan was killed Hed be a captain by now or maybe even a major given the way his career had taken off Maybe hed be married Maybe Id be an aunt Maybe our fathers heart wouldnt have given out that first time from the strain of losing him or that final time that spring two years ago Take me to bed I mentally blurt out then sink down in my seat a little I dont regret it though Today of all days I need a distraction It might be awkward in front of all these people I cant see him from where I know hes sitting at the top of the Battle Brief room but his words feel like a caress on the back of my neck Might be worth it And what would you have done differently Devera asks scanning the crowd I would have asked for reinforcements if Id known the wards were weakening in the area Rhiannon answers I havent changed my mind Violence Theres no future for us And when no reinforcements are available Devera asks arching a brow You have noticed that the graduating classes from the Riders Quadrant are diminishing every year while the uptick in attacks has cost us another seven riders and their dragons this year havent you It takes at least a full company of infantry to make up for the loss of one rider Graduation is ten days away The approaching deadline has me on edge I would have temporarily pulled riders from the midland posts to help rebuild the wards Rhiannon answers Dont remind me Excellent Devera nods Are you seriously going to leave Basgiath without Without what Declaring his undyinglust Yes Of course he would Xaden is a master of containing his emotions which is probably why hes so fixed on containing mine too Or is there some other reason hes holding himself back that Im not considering The sex was great Our chemistry Explosive Were evenfriends though the constant ache in my chest tells me its gone far beyond that If he could just be an asshole then Id write that night off as just sexridiculously mindblowing sexand move on But hes not being an assnot usually at least and now I understand why he takes his job so seriously He shoulders the responsibility for every marked one in here Whatever youre thinking can wait until theres not a room of people between us he says What else do you have for me Devera continues calling on a secondyear Its been a month and a half since we destroyed my roomand weve managed to keep our hands off each other even though one night wasnt enough to satisfy either of us if the tensionfilled evenings on the sparring mats are any indication Of course we both know anything more would only further complicate an already overly complicated situation But surely hes not relieving this sexual tension that stretches taut between uswith someone else Surely The insidious thought spreads with a sickening quickness I stop listening as my stomach twists at an alltooreal possibility Is there someone else Im not having this discussion with you right now Pay attention It takes everything I have not to turn around and yell at him If Ive spent every night tossing and turning in my sheets alone while he Thats a good idea too Aetos Devera smiles A very wingleader answer if I might say so Oh gods Dains ego is going to be unbearable today during sparring if Devera keeps complimenting him Sparring I clasp my pen a little too hard as I remember the way Imogen looked at Xaden that night Shit That would make sense She carries a rebellion relic and definitely isnt the daughter of the woman who killed his father so she has that going for her too Is it Imogen Im going to be sick For fucks sake Violence Is it I know we said we werent going there again but Im kicking myself for telling him I wanted more now and for the fact that I should be paying attention instead of fighting with Xaden At least tell me Sorrengail Xaden snaps I freeze feeling the weight of every gaze on me Yes Riorson Devera prompts He clears his throat If reinforcements were unavailable I would have asked for Mira Sorrengail to temporarily transfer The wards are strong at Montserrat and with her signet she could reinforce the weaknesses until other riders could arrive to strengthen those wards Good idea Devera nods And what riders are the most logical choice to help rebuild the wards in this particular mountain pass Thirdyears I answer Go on Devera tilts her head at me Thirdyears are taught to build wards and at this point in the year theyre leaving anyway I shrug May as well send them early so they can be of use Point fucking made I slam my shield down and block him out Thats a logical choice Devera says And thats all we have for today Dont forget that you should be preparing for the last exercise of War Games before graduation Also we expect each and every one of you in the courtyard in front of Basgiath tonight at nine for fireworks to celebrate Reunification Day Dress uniforms only She lifts her brows at Ridoc He shrugs What else would I be wearing One never knows what youll come up with Devera says dismissing us Anything I need to know about whats going on between you and Liam raises his eyebrows at me as we gather our things Absolutely nothing is going on between us Not one damn thing I insist If Xaden doesnt want to see if there might be more between us message received I turn to Rhiannon So are you excited to finally be able to write to your sister in ten days She grins Ive been writing her once a month since we got here Now Ill finally get to post them At least one good thing is coming with graduation Well all be able to talk to our loved ones again Later that night I adjust the sash across the bodice of my black dress uniform and tuck a loose strand of my hair back into the pretty arrangement Quinn helped me with earlier before meeting Rhiannon in the hallway Shes unbound her hair from its usual braided protective style and the tight coils form a beautiful halo around her face which shes dusted with goldtinted blush Her chosen option of sleek tailored dress pants and a crossbody doublet that cuts across her torso on the diagonal looks phenomenal on her taller frame Hot I say with a nod as she tugs on her sash I went with the high neck sleeveless option to hide my armor and the flowing floorlength skirt with the slit up the thigh which Devera told me was for mobility in case of attack Personally Im not against the flash of thigh it gives when I move especially with all the work Ive put in to strengthen my legs with Imogen My sash is simple the same black satin as everyone elses with my name embroidered just beneath my shoulder and the star of a firstyear I heard theres going to be a mob of infantry guys there Nadine says as she joins us Dont you prefer a little brain with your brawn Ridoc slides right in Sawyer at his side You did not try to leave without me Liam shouts as he runs forward darting through the crowd as we move toward the staircase that leads to Basgiaths main campus I was hoping youd been given the night off I answer truthfully as he reaches my side Dont you look handsome I know He preens sarcastically straightening his sash over a midnightblack doublet Ive heard healer cadets have a thing for riders Hardly Rhiannon laughs As often as they have to put us back together I bet theyre more into scribes What are scribes into Liam asks me as we descend the stairs in a sea of black taking the path we tread every morning toward the Archives Seeing as you were almost one of them Usually other scribes I answer But I guess riders in my fathers case Im just excited to see some people who arent riders Ridoc says holding open the door so we can pass through the tunnel Its getting kind of incestuous around here Agreed Rhiannon nods Oh whatever You and Tara have been on again off again all year Nadine says then blanches Shit Are you off again Were taking a breather until Parapet she says and we enter the Healer Quadrant Hard to believe well be secondyears in a little more than two weeks Sawyer says Hard to believe weve survived I add There was only one name on the death roll this week a thirdyear who didnt come back from an overnight mission By the time we make it to the courtyard the party is in full swing Theres a blend of pale blue for the healers cream for the scribes and the navyblue uniforms of the infantry more than overwhelming the scattered black uniforms There must be a thousand people or more in here Mage lights hang above us in the form of a dozen chandeliers and drapes of rich velvets cover the stone walls of Basgiath transforming the functional outdoor space into a ballroom of sorts Theres even a string quartet playing in the corner Where are you I ask Xaden but theres no answer We all seem to scatter as we enter but Liam stays at my side as tense as the string on my crossbow Tell me youre wearing your armor under all that You think someone is going to knife me in front of my mother I gesture to the exposed balcony where Mom appears to be holding court surveying her domain Our gazes collide and she whispers something to the man next to her disappearing from view Nice to see you too I think if anyone was going to knife you now would be the time especially knowing that killing you has a good chance of ending Fen Riorsons son His voice tightens Thats when I notice the stares of the officers and cadets around us Theyre not gawking at my hair or the name on my sash No their gazes widen at Liams wrist and the visible swirls of his rebellion relic I hook my arm through his and lift my chin Im so sorry There is absolutely nothing for you to be sorry about He gives my hand a reassuring pat Of course there is I whisper Oh gods everyone is here to gather in celebration of the end of what he and the others call the apostasy Theyre celebrating his mothers death You can go You should go This is I shake my head I go where you go His hand tightens over mine A boulder lodges in my throat and I scan the crowd instinctively knowing that hes not here Theres no Garrick no Bodhi no Imogen and definitely no Xaden No wonder he was in such a shit mood today This isnt fair to you I glare at the infantry officer who has the nerve to look appalled at the sight of Liams wrist I highly doubt you enjoy celebrating the anniversary of your brothers death either Liam holds himself with a dignity I could never imagine Brennan would hate all of this I gesture to the crowd He was more about getting the work done than celebrating its completion Yeah sounds like His words die and I squeeze his arm tighter as I note the separating crowd before us King Tauri walks at my mothers side and from the direction of his wide toothy smile hes headed this way A purple sash crosses his doublet pinned to his chest by a dozen medals hes never won from a hundred battlefields hes never stepped foot on Moms medals are all earned and they adorn her black sash like jewelry as it drapes across her highnecked longsleeve dress uniform Go I hiss at Liam in a whisper forcing a smile for my mothers sake as General Melgren joins them Melgren may be brilliant but hes also unnerving as fuck to be around When your greatest danger approaches I think not His spine straightens Im going to rip Xadens gorgeous head off for forcing Liam through this Your Majesty I murmur dropping a foot behind me like Mira taught and bending as I bow my head noting that Liam has bowed at the waist Your mother tells me youve bonded with not one but two exceptional dragons King Tauri says smiling under his mustache Yes she is quite confident in your power Melgren adds his smile icy as he stares at me in blatant appraisal I would not say the same at this time I answer with a polite smile Ive spent enough time around egotistical generals politicians and royalty to know when to be humble Im still learning how to wield Dont be so modest daughter Mom chides From what her professors say theyve only seen a gift this powerful a few times in the last decade in Brennan and the Riorson boy That boy is a twentythreeyearold man but I know better than to correct her and put an even bigger target on Xadens back And your gift King Tauri asks Liam Farsight Your Majesty Liam responds Melgrens eyes narrow on Liams exposed rebellion relic then rise to his sash Mairi as in Colonel Mairis son I squeeze his arm tighter against mine in silent support and Mom notices Yes General Though I was mostly brought up by Duke Lindell at Tirvainne His jaw flexes but thats the only physical sign of his discomfort Ahh King Tauri nods Yes Duke Lindell is a good man a loyal man The superiority in his air makes me want to snatch the medals off his chest I have him to thank for my fortitude Majesty Liam plays the game well Yes you do Melgren nods again his gaze scanning the crowd Now tell me where is the Riorson boy I always like to lay eyes on him once a year and make sure hes not causing trouble No trouble I answer earning a swift glare from Mom Hes our wingleader actually He saved my life when we were on the front lines at Montserrat By making me leave instead of staying to help but still he deserves the credit for me not distracting Mira and getting her myself and Tairn killed Xadens done more than save me He believed me when I told him Amber led the unbondeds to my room He had an entire arsenal of daggers crafted just for me He designed a saddle for Tairn so I can ride into battle with my peers Hed protected me when I needed and taught me to defend myself so I wouldnt require protection forever And when others are quick to stand in front of me Xaden always stands at my side trusting me to hold my own But I dont say any of that Whats the point Xaden wouldnt give a fuck what these people think of himso I wont either Instead I just continue to offer a simpering smile seemingly in awe of the powerful men before me Their dragons are mated Mom offers her smile chilling So shes grown quite close to him out of necessity Out of lust and need and the ache in my chest Im terrified to define but sure necessity works Thats excellent King Tauri beams Its good to have a Sorrengail on lookout for us Youll let us know if he decides to oh I dont know He laughs Start another war Melgren is fully capable of seeing the outcome of any such absurdity and yet he stares at Liam and me with unnerving focus My entire body tenses I can assure you hes loyal So where is he King Tauri scans the courtyard I asked that they all be here all marked ones I just saw him a little earlier I smile through the notquite lie Battle Brief was earlier Id check the edges Hes not much for parties Oh look Theres Dain Aetos Mom says nodding somewhere behind my shoulder Hed be so humbled if you said hello she prompts the king Of course The three of them walk off leaving Liam and me standing in complete silence as we pivot to watch them so we dont accidentally turn our backs on the king I feel like Ive just survived certain death or at least some kind of natural disaster Im going to kill him for making you come to this I mutter under my breath as Dain greets the king with perfect manners Xaden didnt make me come What My gaze jumps to his Hed never ask this of me Never ask it of anyone But I told him I would keep you safe and thats what Im doing keeping you safe He flashes a crooked smile You are a good friend Liam Mairi I rest my head on his arm You saved my life Violet The least I can do is grin and bear it through a fucking party Im not sure I can grin and bear it Not with the way people constantly glance at his wrist like hes the one who personally led the army to the border Dain smiles as the king takes his leave then glances over his shoulder meeting my gaze and heading our way He grins and its all too easy to remember how many events just like this weve attended together over the years His touch is gentle when he cups my cheek You look beautiful tonight Vi Thank you I smile You look fabulous yourself His hand falls away as he turns to Liam Has this one tried to escape yet Shes always hated these things Not yet but the evening is young Liam replies Dain must read the tense lines of Liams face because his smile slips when he looks back at me The staircase is about five feet to our right Ill distract while you slip away Thank you I nod in thanks offering him a soft smile Lets get out of here I say to Liam Once were out of the party and back in the Riders Quadrant I walk straight into the courtyard and ground letting power swirl around and through me I sense the golden energy from Andarna the blazing power from Tairn that connects me to Sgaeyl and finally the shimmering shadows of Xaden I open my eyes tracing the ebb and flow of that shimmering shadow and I know hes somewhere in front of me Liam you know I adore you right Well thats nice Go away I walk straight ahead through the courtyard What Liam catches up to me I cant just leave you out here by yourself No offense but I can fry this entire place with a lightning bolt if I want to and I need to see Xaden so go I pat his arm and keep striding toward the feeling using it to guide me I mean your aim is shit according to you but I get the rest he calls out falling behind I dont bother with a mage light as I pass the area where we usually stand in formation and keep walking toward the figures lounging against the only opening in this godsforsaken wall Theres only one place Xaden can be Tell me hes not out there I say to Garrick and Bodhi whose features I can barely see in the moonlight I could tell you that but Id be lying Bodhi remarks rubbing the back of his neck Youre not going to want to see him Not tonight Sorrengail Garrick warns with a grimace Selfpreservation is a thing Notice were not with him and were his best friends Yeah well Im his I open my mouth and shut it a few times becausefuck if I know what I am to him But the longing that holds my heart hostage this driving need to be at his side because I know hes suffering no matter if it means throwing myself headfirst into uncertaintyI cant deny what he is to me I kick off the leather slippers of my dress uniformtheyre more of a hazard than anything and in this wind Well well see how it goes Im justhis For the first time since last year I step up onto the parapet As for the 107 innocents the children of the executed officers they now carry what shall be known as the rebellion relic transferred by the dragon who carried out the kings justice And to show the mercy of our great king they will all be conscripted into the prestigious Riders Quadrant at Basgiath so they may prove their loyalty to our kingdom with their service or with their death Addendum 42 the Treaty of Aretia CHAPTER THIRTYTWO Walking the parapet on Conscription Day is a certifiable risk Walking the parapet in a dress uniform barefoot in the dark Now this is madness The first ten feet while Im still inside the walls are the easiest and as I reach the edge where the wind ruffles my skirt like a sail I start to doubt my plan Its going to be hard to get to Xaden if I fall to my death But I see him sitting about a third of the way across the narrow stone bridge staring up at the moon like it somehow adds to the burden he carries and my heart fucking hurts He had the lives of all one hundred and seven marked ones carved into his back taking responsibility for them But who takes responsibilitytakes careof him Everyone across the ravine is celebrating his fathers death and hes out here mourning it alone When Brennan died I had Mira and Dad but Xadens had no one You dont really know me Not at my core Isnt that how he replied when I told him that Id end up falling for him As if knowing him would somehow make me want him less but everything I learn about him only makes me tumble harder and faster Oh gods I know this feeling Denying it doesnt make it any less true My feelings are what they are I havent run from a challenge since I crossed this parapet a year ago and Im not about to start now The last time I stood here I was terrified but the distance to the ground isnt what has my pulse pounding now Theres more than one way to fall Shit That ache in my chest burns brighter than the power coursing through my veins Im in love with Xaden It doesnt matter that hes leaving soon or that he probably doesnt feel the same for me It doesnt even matter that he warned me not to fall for him Its not an infatuation our physical chemistry or even the bond between our dragons that keeps me reaching in every way possible for this man Its my reckless heart Ive kept out of his bedout of his armsbecause hes adamant I cant fall for him but that ship has long sailed so whats the point in holding back Shouldnt I grab hold of every moment we can have while hes still here I take the first step onto the narrow stone bridge and put my arms out for balance Its just like walking along Tairns spine which Ive done hundreds of times Except Im in a dress And Tairn isnt going to catch me if I fall Hes going to be so pissed when he hears that I did this Already am Xadens head snaps in my direction Violence I take a step and then another holding my frame upright with muscle memory I didnt have last year and begin to cross Xaden swings his legs up and then fucking jumps to his feet Turn around right now he shouts Come with me I call over the wind bracing myself as a gust whips my skirt against my legs Should have gone with the pants I mutter and keep walking Hes already coming my way his strides just as long and confident as if he was on solid ground eating up the distance between us as I move forward slowly until we meet What the fuck are you doing out here he asks locking his hands on my waist Hes in riding leathers not a dress uniform and hes never looked better What am I doing out here Im risking everything to reach him And if he rejects me No Theres no room for fear on the parapet I could ask you the same thing His eyes widen You could have fallen and died I could say the same thing I smile but its shaky The look in his eyes is wild like hes been driven past the point where he can contain himself in the neat apathetic facade he usually wears in public It doesnt scare me I like him better when hes real with me anyway And did you stop to think that if you fall and die then I can die He leans in and my pulse jumps Again I say softly resting my hands on his firm chest right above his heartbeat I could say the same thing Even if Xadens death wouldnt kill Sgaeyl Im not sure I could survive it Shadows rise darker than the night that surrounds us Youre forgetting that I wield shadows Violence Im just as safe out here as I am in the courtyard Are you going to wield lightning to break your fall Fine Thats a good point Iperhaps did not think that part through as thoroughly as you I admit I wanted to be close to him so I got close parapet be damned Youre seriously going to be the death of me His fingers flex at my waist Go back Its not a rejection not with the way hes looking at me Weve been sparring emotionally for the past month hell even longer than that and one of us has to expose our jugular I finally trust him enough to know he wont go for the kill Only if you do I want to be wherever you are And I mean it Everyone elseeverything else in the world can fall away and I wont care as long as Im with him Violence I know why you said you dont see a future for us My heart races like its trying to take flight as I blurt out the words Do you Of course he isnt going to make this easy Im not sure the man even knows what easy is You want me I say looking him in the eyes And no Im not just talking about in bed You Want Me Xaden Riorson You might not say it but you do one better and show it You show it every time you choose to trust me every time your eyes linger on mine You show it with every sparring lesson you dont have time for and every flight lesson that pulls you away from your own studies You show it when you refuse to touch me because youre worried I dont really want you then show it again when you take the time to hunt down violets before a leadership meeting so I dont wake up feeling alone You show it in a million different ways Please dont deny it His jaw flexes but he doesnt deny it You think we dont have a future because youre scared that I wont like who you really are behind all those walls you keep And Im scared too I can admit it Youre graduating Im not Youll be gone in a matter of weeks and were probably setting ourselves up for heartbreak But if we let fear kill whatever this is between us then we dont deserve it I lift one hand to the back of his neck I told you that I was the one who would decide when Im ready to risk my heart and Im saying it The way he looks at me with the same mix of hope and apprehension currently flooding my system gives me absolute life You dont mean that he says shaking his head And there he goes sucking the life right out again I mean it If this is about the Imogen thing Its not I shake my head the wind catching the curls Quinn spent so much time on I know theres no one else I wouldnt be walking the parapet in the middle of the night if I thought you were playing me His brow furrows and he pulls me in closer against the warmth of his body Then what made you even think that Have to admit it pissed me off Ive given you exactly zero reasons to think Im in anyone elses bed Which means hes only in mine My own insecurities and the way she looked at you and Garrick sparring You might not have a thing for her but she definitely has one for you I know that look Its the same look I have when Im watching you Embarrassment heats my cheeks I could change the subject or deflect but its not going to do our relationshipif thats even what this isany favors if I hide my feelings no matter how weak the irrational ones might make me seem Youre jealous He bites back a smile Maybe I admit then decide that answer is halfassed Fine Yes Shes strong and fierce and has that same ruthless streak you do Ive always thought she was a better match for you I know the feeling well He shakes his head And you are strong and fierce and have a ruthless streak too Not to mention youre the smartest person Ive ever met That mind of yours is sexy as hell Imogen and I are just friends Trust me she wasnt looking at me and even if she were He pauses his hand slipping to cradle the back of my head as he holds us steady despite the gusting wind Gods help me Im only looking at you Hope is a stronger buzz than anything they were serving at the party She wasnt looking at you No Rethink what you just said but take me out of the equation He lifts his brows waiting for me to come to the right conclusion But on the sparring mat My eyes widen She has a thing for Garrick Catching on fast arent you I am Are you done pushing me away He draws back searching my eyes in the moonlight before glancing over my shoulder You done putting yourself in harms way to get your point across Probably not He sighs Theres only you Violence Is that what you needed to hear I nod Even when Im not with you theres only you Next time just ask Youve never had a problem being bluntly honest with me Wind blows around us but hes as immovable as the parapet itself As I remember youve even thrown daggers at my head which I greatly prefer over watching you get tangled up in your thoughts If were going to do this then we have to trust each other And you want to do this I hold my breath He sighs long and hard then admits Yes His hand slides up and he caresses my cheek with his thumb I cant make you any promises Violence But Im tired of fighting it Yes One word has never meant so much to me Then I blink remembering his previous comment about jealousy What do you mean you know the feeling of jealousy well His hands tighten on my waist and he looks away Oh no if I have to trust you and tell you what Im thinking then I expect the same from you Im not going to be the only vulnerable one out on this ledge He grumbles dragging his gaze back to mine I saw Aetos kiss you after Threshing and nearly lost my shit If I didnt already love him that might have pushed me over the edge You wanted me then Ive wanted you from the first second I saw you Violence he admits And if I was short with you todaywell its just a shit day I understand And you know Dain and I are just friends right I know thats how you feel though I wasnt sure back then He runs his thumb over the swell of my lips Now get your ass back on solid ground He wants to stay out here and wallow Come with me My fingers grasp the material of his flight leathers ready to tug him along if I have to He shakes his head and looks away Im not in a place to take care of anyone tonight And yes I know thats a shitty thing to say since its the anniversary of losing Brennan I know I slide my hands down his arms Come with me Xaden Vi His shoulders dip and the sadness that permeates the air between us puts a lump in my throat Trust me I step back out of his arms and take his hands Come on A moment of tense silence passes before he nods once moving forward and holding me steady while I turn around Im much better at this than I was last July So I see He stays close one hand on my waist as I walk the last part of the parapet In a fucking dress Its a skirt actually I say over my shoulder only feet away from the wall Eyes forward he grumbles and its only the fear in his tone that keeps me from doing something arrogant like skipping the last few feet The second were within the confines of the wall he hauls me against him my back to his front Dont ever put your life at risk over something as trivial as talking to me again Its as low as a growl against my ear sending a shiver down my spine Next year is going to be so much fun I tease walking forward and lacing my fingers with his so he follows Liam will be here next year to make sure youre not doing asinine things he mutters Youre going to love getting his letters I promise jumping the final foot off the parapet to the courtyard below Huh I glance around the empty courtyard while putting my slippers back on Garrick and Bodhi were just here They probably know Im going to kill them for letting you out there A dress Sorrengail Really I take his hand in mine and head across the courtyard Where are we going He sounds just as much the asshole as the day I met him Youre taking me to your room I say over my shoulder as we approach the dormitory Im what I throw open the door grateful for the mage lights that make it easy to see him now sneer and all Youre taking me to your room Turning left I lead us past the hallway to my room and then start up the wide spiral staircase Someone will see he argues Its not my reputation Im worried about Sorrengail Youre a firstyear and Im your wingleader Pretty sure everyone already knowswe set half the forest on fire that night I remind him as we climb past the door to the secondyear hallway Did you know that the first time I climbed these steps with Dain I was horrified that there wasnt a handrail Did you know I cant stand to hear his name on your lips while youre leading the way to my room He trudges up the steps behind me shadows curling from the wall as if they sense his mood and want nothing to do with it But his shadows dont scare me Theres nothing about this man that scares me anymore except the magnitude of my feelings for him Point is and now look at me I grin as we reach the thirdyear floor and I push open the arched door All but dancing on the parapet in a dress Probably not a good time to remind me He follows me into the hallway It looks like the secondyear floor except there are fewer doors and a high vaulted roof Which one is yours I should make you guess he mutters but keeps my fingers laced with his as we walk to the end of the massively long hall Of course its the last one Fourth Wing I scoff Always has to go the farthest He unweaves his own wards and opens his door standing back so I can walk in first Im going to have to either ward your new door before I go or teach you how in the next ten days Im not thinking about the looming deadline of his departure as I step into his room for the first time Its twice as big as mineand so is the bed Surviving to third year has some serious perks Or maybe the size reflects his rank who knows Its immaculately clean with a large armchair by the bed darkgray rug wide wooden armoire tidy desk and a bookshelf that gives me instant envy A sword rack consumes the area beside the door complete with so many daggers that I cant possibly count them all and across the space next to the desk stands a throwing target just like I have in my room Theres a table and chairs in the corner and his window faces Basgiath but is framed by thick black curtains with Fourth Wings emblem on the bottom We do leadership meetings for the sections in here sometimes he says from the doorway I pivot to find him watching me with curious eyes like hes waiting for me to pass judgment on his space Walking past the sword rack I let my fingers graze across the handles of the different daggers How many challenges have you won anyway The better question is how many have I lost he says coming in and closing the door behind him Theres the ego I know and love so much I mutter making my way to the bed which just like mine is outfitted in black Have I told you how beautiful you look tonight His voice lowers If not Im a fool because you are magnificently beautiful Heat rises in my cheeks and my mouth curves into a smile Thank you Now sit I pat the edge of his bed What His eyebrows rise Sit I order staring him down I dont want to talk about it I never said you had to Theres no need to ask what it is nor am I going to let what happened nearly six years ago drive a wedge between us not even for one night To my absolute surprise he does as I ask sitting on the side of his bed His long legs stretch out in front of him and he leans back slightly on the heels of his hands Now what I move between his thighs and run my fingers through his hair He closes his eyes and leans into my touch and I swear I feel my heart crack wide open Now I take care of you His eyes fly open and gods are they beautiful Ive memorized every gold fleck in those onyx depths and its a good thing since I dont know where hell be sent after graduation Seeing him once every few days isnt the same as being able to touch him anytime I like Leaving his hair I sink to my knees before him Violet Im just taking off your boots A smirk plays at my lips as I unlace one then the other taking them off I rise and carry his boots toward the armoire You can just leave them there he blurts I put them on the floor next to the armoire and walk back I wasnt going to go snooping through your clothes and its not like I havent seen them all anyway His gaze locks on my skirt heating every time the slit reveals a section of my thigh Youve been wearing that all night Thats what you get for walking behind me I tease coming to stand between his thighs again I cant really argue about the view from the back either He tilts his chin to look up at me Be quiet and let me get this off you I undo the line of diagonal buttons across his chest and he shrugs out of the leathers Were you flying tonight It usually helps He nods as I lean over to set them on the armchair This day is always Im sorry I look him in the eyes as I say it hoping he knows how very much I mean it as I return reaching for his shirt Im sorry too He lifts his arms and I tug the shirt off before putting it with the flight jacket You have nothing to be sorry about I keep my eyes on his as I cup the unrelenting angles of his face then trace the scar that bisects a brow Challenge Sgaeyl He shrugs Threshing Most dragons scar their riders but Tairn and Andarna have never hurt me I say absentmindedly my hand slipping down his neck Or maybe they knew you already carried a scar He trails his fingers down the long silver scar on my arm from Tynans blade I wanted to fucking kill them And instead I had to stand there and watch them go at you threeonone I was at the edge of my control and ready to step in when Tairn landed It was only twoonone once Jack ran I reminded him And you couldnt have interfered Its against the rules remember But he took that step That single step that told me he would have A corner of his mouth quirks into one of the sexiest smirks Ive ever seen At the end of the day you walked away with two dragons His expression falls Two weeks from now I wont even be here to watch when youre challenged let alone do anything about it Ill be fine I promise Whomever I cant beat in a challenge Ill just poison He doesnt laugh Come on lets get you to bed I lean in and kiss the scar on his eyebrow It will be tomorrow when you wake up I dont deserve you His arm curls around my hips and he tugs me closer But Im going to keep you all the same Good I lean in and brush my lips over his Because I think Im in love with you My heart beats erratically and panic claws up my rib cage I shouldnt have said it His eyes flare wide and his arms tighten around me You think Or you know Be brave Even if he doesnt feel the same at least I will have spoken my truth I know Im so wildly in love with you that I cant imagine what my life would even look like without you in it And I probably shouldnt have said that but if were doing this then were starting from a place of complete honesty He crushes his mouth to mine and pulls me fully into his lap so Im straddling him He kisses me so deep that I lose myself in it in him There are no words as he takes off my sash my top and unbuttons my skirt all without breaking the kiss Stand he says against my lips Xaden My heart thunders I fucking need you Violet Right now And I dont need anyone so Im not quite sure how to handle this feeling but Im giving it my best And if you dont want this tonight thats fine but Im going to need you to walk out that door right now because if you dont Im going to have you naked on your back in the next two minutes The intensity in his eyes and the vehemence of his words should frighten me but they dont Even if this man loses every ounce of his selfcontrol I know hell never hurt me Not with his body at least Walk away or stay but either way I need you to stand up he begs I think two minutes might be overestimating your skills with a corset I glance down at my armor He grins and lifts me from his lap My feet hit the floor Im timing you Is that One Two I hold up my fingers Three Hes on his feet in a heartbeat and then his mouth is on mine and I stop counting Im too busy chasing the strokes of his tongue feeling the ripple of his muscles beneath my fingertips to give a shit where my clothes are going I feel air rush against my legs as my skirt hits the floor and I help him out by kicking off my slippers while I suck on his tongue He groans his hands flying over my back Laces loosen in record time and the corset falls to the floor leaving me in my underwear since there wasnt much else fitting underneath that dress uniform Daggers both his and mine hit the ground as he unstraps the sheaths at my thighs and undoes his own Its a glorious cacophony of metal until were both naked and hes kissing me breathless Then his hands are in my hair and pins fly until the mass falls down my back unbound He pulls back only long enough to rake his ravenous gaze down my body So fucking beautiful I think that might have been a little longer than two I start but he grabs the back of my thighs and lifts sweeping my feet out from underneath me My back hits the bed with a slight bounce and honestly I should have seen that move coming given that hes been putting me on my back for the better part of a year now Still counting he asks dropping to his knees beside the bed and dragging me across the soft coverlet to the edge Do you need me to keep score I tease as my ass hits the end of the bed Feel free He grins and before I can get another word in his mouth is between my thighs I suck in a sharp breath and throw my head back at the sheer pleasure of his tongue licking and swirling around my clit Oh gods Which one are you calling out for he asks against my flesh Because its just you and me in this room Vi and I dont share You My fingers tangle in his hair Im calling out for you I appreciate the elevation to deity but my name will do He licks me from entrance to clit finally flicking his tongue over that sensitive bud and I moan Fuck you taste good He lifts my thighs up onto his shoulders and settles in like he has nowhere else to be tonight Then he absolutely devours me with tongue and teeth Pleasure hot and insistent spirals in my stomach and Im lost in sensation my hips rising and falling as I chase the high he drives me toward with every expert stab of his tongue My thighs tremble when he takes up a rhythm against my clit and drives two fingers inside me They lock when he strokes his fingers in time with his tongue Mindless Im simply mindless Power rushes through me in a deluge mingling with the pleasure until theyre one and the same and when he tips me over the edge of oblivion its his name I scream as that power whips outward with every wave of my climax Thunder booms shaking the paneled glass in Xadens windows Thats one he says kissing his way up my limp body Though I do think were going to have to work on the fireworks show or people are always going to know what were doing Your mouth is I shake my head as his hands slide under me moving us to the center of his bed There are no words for that Delicious he whispers his lips skimming the plane of my stomach You are absolutely delicious I never should have waited this long to get my mouth on you I gasp when he sucks the peak of my breast into his mouth his tongue lashing and stroking my nipple as he works the other between thumb and forefinger setting a whole new fire within me built on the embers of the first By the time he gets to my neck Im a writhing flame beneath him touching every part of him I can reach stroking my hands down his arms his back his chest Gods this man is incredible every line of him carved for battle and built by sparring and swordplay Our mouths meet in a deep kiss and I can taste us both in it as I draw my knees upward settling his hips right where theyre meant to bebetween my thighs Violet he groans and I can feel the head of him at my entrance I dont get equal time to play I tease arching my hips so he slides against me and making my own breath catch with the motion He nips my lower lip You can play all you want later if I can have you right now Yeah thats a plan I can get with You already have me His gaze collides with mine as he hovers above me bracing his weight to keep from crushing me You have everything I have to give Thats enoughfor now I nod arching my hips again Eyes locked with mine he pushes into me with one long roll of his hips consuming every inch and then taking another until hes seated to the hilt The pressure the stretch the fit of him is beyond words You feel so damn good I roll my hips because I cant help myself I could say the same thing about you He smiles using my own words from earlier against me Hard deep and slow he sets a rhythm that has me arching for every thrust as we come together again and again and again He drives us up the bed and I throw my arms back bracing against the headboard for leverage as I meet every plunge of his hips Gods each is better than the last When I urge him to move faster he gives me a wicked grin and takes me at the same mindblowing heartjolting pace I want this to last I need this to last But Im That fire in my core is coiled tight and so ready to burst free that I can almost taste how sweet it will be I know He drives forward again and I whimper at how fucking good it feels Just stay with me He adjusts the angle so he hits my clit with every thrust and presses my knee forward taking me even deeper Im not going to survive this Im going to die right here in this bed Then Im going to die with you he promises kissing me Im so far gone I didnt even realize I said the words out loud and then I remember that I dont have to More I need more Power simmers beneath my skin and my legs lock Youre almost there Fuck you feel so damn good around me Im never going to get enough of this enough of you I love you The words are so incredibly freeing even if he doesnt say them back His eyes flare and his control snaps as he pounds into me and that coiled pleasure explodes as my powers whip out again cracking through the room shattering like glass as he throws his weight to the side bringing me with him as he drives toward his own release groaning into the side of my neck as the last waves of my orgasm leave me shuddering against him Long minutes pass before our breathing steadies and a light breeze kisses my thigh thats thrown over his Youre all right he asks brushing my hair back from my face Im great Youre great That was Great he supplies Exactly I was going to use the word explosive but I think great covers it His fingers tangle in my hair I fucking love your hair If you ever want to bring me to my knees or win an argument just let it down Ill get the point I grin as the breeze rustles through the browntosilver strands Wait There shouldnt be a breeze My stomach drops as I push myself up on an elbow to look over Xadens shoulder Oh no no no My hand covers my mouth as I glimpse the destruction Im pretty sure I blew your window out Unless theres someone else throwing lightning around then yeah that was you See what I mean Explosive He laughs I gasp Thats why he threw himself sideways to shield me from my own wreckage Im so sorry I scan over the damage but theres only sand on the bed Im going to have to get that under control I threw up a shield Dont worry about it He pulls me back in for a kiss What are we going to do Repairing a window is on a whole different level from replacing an armoire Right now He strokes my hair back from my face again That was two if were still counting and I say we clean up get the sand out of the bed and get you to three maybe four if youre still awake My jaw drops After I just shattered your window He smiles and shrugs Ive got us covered just in case you decide to take out the dresser next I gaze down at his body and the craving for him ignites again How could it not when he looks like the gods blessed him and feels like the gods blessed me Yeah lets go for three Were going for five my hips in Xadens hands while I slowly ride him when I trail my fingers down the black swirls of the relic on his neck Im not sure how either of us is still moving and yet we cant seem to stop tonight cant get enough It really is beautiful I tell him rising up only to sink back down again taking him deep within me His dark eyes flare as his hands flex I used to think of it as a curse but now I realize its a gift He arches his hips hitting me at a sublime angle A gift Gods hes robbing me of every thought Someone pounds on the door Go the fuck away Xaden snarls reaching up my back and hooking onto my shoulder to pull me down into his next thrust I fall forward muffling my moan in his neck I really wish I could Theres enough regret in the voice that I believe it Someone better be dead if I get out of this bed Garrick Xaden retorts I think therere a lot of people dead which is why theyre calling the full quadrant to formation jackass Garrick growls Both Xaden and I startle our gazes colliding in shock I slide off him and Xaden covers me with his blanket before shoving his legs into his leathers and striding for the door What the fuck are you talking about he asks through a tiny opening in the door Grab your flight leathers and youd better bring Sorrengail with you too Garrick says Were under attack The inability to control a powerful signet is just as dangerous to a riderand everyone in their vicinityas never manifesting one Major Afendras Guide to the Riders Quadrant Unauthorized Edition CHAPTER THIRTYTHREE Ive never gotten dressed so fast in my entire life and Im not even bothering with the thigh sheaths What time is it I ask Xaden pulling on my formal dress and slippers and blowing my hair out of my face Mandatory urgent formation for the entire quadrant means now The wards are falling How many Navarrians are we going to lose Four fifteen He finishes lacing his boots already armed to the teeth as Im picking up my sheaths pretty sure Im missing one of them Youre going to freeze out there Ill be fine I drop to my knees and locate the missing dagger hauling it out by the strap of the sheath before standing again Here Xaden throws one of his flight jackets over me trapping my hair If Garricks right and were under attack then my guess is theyll order the older years to staff the midguard posts so you shouldnt be out in formation too long I cant stand the thought of you being cold Which means hell be leaving My heart somersaults as I clumsily shove my arms through the sleeves of his jacket Hell be safe right It will just be a midland assignment and hes the most powerful rider in the quadrant With my hands full of weapons I dont argue about him buttoning the flight jacket over my chest We have to get to formation His hands cradle my face And if I have to go then dont worry Im sure Sgaeyl will drag me back in a few days He leans in and kisses me hard and quick Wanting you will be the death of me Lets go The best thing about a war college in complete and utter chaos No one notices when I slip out of my wingleaders room and into the sea of riders all tugging on their own clothes to get to formation Everyone is running on adrenaline too busy getting their shit together to notice what Im doing or the brief touch of Xadens hand against mine before he heads toward leadership gathered near the dais in the courtyard Im not the only one still in my dress uniform either The wind has a bite to it as I make it into formation but at least Xadens flight jacket keeps my hair tucked away This had better be good because I was finally taking my shot with that gorgeous brunette healer Ridoc whines as he steps into formation behind me Liam stands to my right still buttoning the top on his uniform Good night I ask Liam Fine he mutters his cheeks turning pink in the moonlight Anyone seen Dain I ask Nadine as she steps into formation ahead of me All the squad leaders are with leadership she answers over her shoulder as Rhiannon jogs up Rhi cracks a huge yawn then glances my way and does a doubletake Violet Sorrengail she whispers moving closer Are you wearing Riorsons flight jacket Liams head snaps in my direction curse his stupidly good hearing Why would you say that I do a shitty job of feigning shock and shove the sheaths into every available pocket in this thing All three of them which are considerably deeper than the ones in my own jacket Oh I dont know Because its huge on you and there are three stars right here She taps where theres only one star on her uniform Well shit Just goes to show that neither of us was thinking clearly It could be any thirdyears I shrug With a Fourth Wing shield on the shoulder She cocks an eyebrow That does limit it a bit I agree And a wingleader emblem beneath those stars she teases Fine its his I whisper quickly as Commandant Panchek takes the dais followed by Dains father and the wingleaders Xadens damn good at keeping his eyes off me but I cant say the same especially when theres little doubt hes about to be sent away and I can still feel his mouth on my skin I knew it Rhi grins Tell me its good I broke his window I wince and my cheeks heat Likeyou threw something at it Her brow knits No As in lightning strucka lot and I shattered his window I glance toward the dais And look there he is now all calm cool and collected My chest tightens as I wonder which is the real version of him The one standing up there in complete control ready to command his wing Or the one I had inside me less than a half hour ago The one who declared that he doesnt deserve me but is going to keep me Xaden looks anything but pleased and his gaze locks with mine for a millisecond Fucking War Games Relief and disbelief hit me in equal measure Youre kidding me We got hauled out of bed for War Games Nope Damn Rhiannon grins I wish someone made me shatter windows I turn toward her rolling my eyes Oh please youve had way more Hey Aetos Rhiannon says leaning on my shoulder and quickly draping her hand over my collarbone to hide Xadens insignia and rank Good morning huh Dain looks at Rhiannon like shes drunk too much mead as he approaches the squad Not really no He glances over the rest of us I know its earlyor late depending on your night but weve spent all year training for this so wake the hell up He turns to face the dais as Panchek takes the podium Thanks I whisper to Rhiannon as she stands back at my side Im not up for listening to Dain lecture me about my choices Not tonight Riders Quadrant Panchek shouts his voice carrying across the courtyard Welcome to the last event of this years War Games A murmur rips through the formation The alert that was sounded is similar to what it would have been if this were a reallife attackto see how fast you would musterand we will continue this exercise as if it is Were the borders to be simultaneously attacked and the wards faltering you would all be called into service to reinforce the wings Colonel Aetos would you do us the honor of reading the scenario Dains dad steps forward scroll in hand and begins to read The moment weve dreaded has arrived The wards weve dedicated our lives to upholding are falling and there has been an unprecedented multilevel attack along our borders putting villages under siege from drifts of gryphon riders Mass casualties among civilians and infantry are already being reported as are the deaths of multiple riders Hes laying on the melodrama pretty thick As we would if you were a battleready force we are sending your wings in every direction he continues focusing on each wing until coming to ours Fourth Wing to the southeast Each squad will pick which outpost they will reinforce within that region He holds up a finger Choices are first come first served Wingleaders however will be assigned to theirs for the purposes of determining a headquarters for this exercise He turns to each wingleader giving out orders but glances in our directionno doubt looking for Dainbefore he turns toward Xaden Something about the way his smile slips for a heartbeat makes the hair rise on the back of my neck Riorson youll establish your headquarters for Fourth Wing at Athebyne Wingleaders assemble your headquarters squads at your own discretion pulling from any and all riders within your wings Consider this a test of leadership as there are no limitations in a realworld scenario You will receive the updated orders once you reach your selected outposts for this fiveday exercise He steps back Athebyne Thats beyond the wardsthats where Xaden flew his secretive mission My gaze seeks out his but hes focused on the colonel Five whole days This is going to be so much fun Heaton exclaims with terrifying glee running their hand over the purple flames dyed into their hair Were going to pretend war Yeah Imogen adds quietly I think we are Just like real life you squad leaders need to make your choices quickly then report to the flight field within thirty minutes Panchek decrees Youre dismissed Tairn Already moving Were going to claim the outpost at Eltuval the northernmost one in our assigned region Dain says turning around to face us as Rhiannon leans over my shoulder again blocking Xadens insignia Im not getting stuck at some coastal outpost when we know thats not how Poromiel would choose to attack Anyone have a problem with that We all shake our heads Good then you heard the commandant You have thirty minutes to change pack what you can carry for five days and get your asses to the flight field Formation breaks and we all scurry to our dormitory rooms What do you think our orders will be when we get there Rhiannon asks as we force our way through the bottleneck of cadets all trying to get into the barracks More eggs to hunt Guess were about to find out It takes ten minutes to wrap my knees and support my shoulders for a long flight then dress in my own flight leathers It takes another five minutes to detangle my hair from Xadens handling and braid it which leaves me exactly five to pack I throw Xadens jacket in my rucksack just in case anyone snoops through my room while Im gone Wear every single dagger you own Xaden demands startling me Im already wearing twelve I continue throwing items into my overnight pack Good Ill see you on the flight field right If he leaves without saying goodbye Im going to track him down and kill him myself Yes His reply is curt but I finish packing and head out meeting Rhiannon and Liam in the hallway A buzz of excitement accompanies the crowd as we make our way to the flight field taking rations the kitchen staff hands out near commons on our way No doubt well be eating breakfast midflight When we arrive it takes me a second to absorb the sight Every dragon from the quadrant fills the field standing in the same formation we keep in the courtyard and hundreds of mage lights float overhead like hovering stars giving the space an otherworldly feel as though were in a great hall instead of on the flight field Its beautiful and menacing at the same time Theres a nervous mix of energy and anticipation and more than one person hurling up whatever theyve had to drink as the field floods with riders Were going to win Rhiannon states as we make our way through the wings amid way too many snarling dragons and snapping teeth Were not the only ones anxious tonight Were the best Well win Her face is set in lines of determination I can almost taste that squad leader designation for next year Youll get it I tell her then turn toward Liam as we approach our section What about you Want to distinguish yourself with glory so you can rise to squad leader Hes a shooin with his handtohand skills and stellar marks in classes Well see Hes unusually tense as we keep walking We make it to our dragons and I cant help but notice that Tairn is standing in what should be Caths spot forcing Dains dragon to the side as Dain does a head count My egotistical dragon is already saddled with Andarna under his wing Shit Theyre going to force Andarna to keep up with us And if we take enemy fire then you find the first available cover and hide just like last scenario Youre too shiny for your own good Tairn tells her All right What are you wearing I ask Andarna who struts out from under Tairns wing with her head held high boasting a contraption that reminds me of a saddle but isnt The wingleader had it made for me See It hooks to Tairns I cant help but smile as I see the shape of the triangle on Andarnas back that Im sure fits the one on Tairns chest Its amazing Its just in case I cant keep up Now I can come along Just another reason to adore Xaden Well I love it I turn to Tairn whos busy snapping at Cath to give him more room Need me to attach anything I have it handled Im sure you do Then it hits me Five days Damn Are you going to be all right if youre separ Second Squad Dain calls out Prepare for a fourhour first leg of our flight Well need to keep a tight formation for the first fifteen minutes as the squads disperse He glances my way then over my shoulder Wingleader I pivot and see Xaden striding our way the hilts of two swords strapped to his back rising above his shoulders and my throat closes How am I supposed to say goodbye to him in front of all these people And worse how are our dragons going to cope Dont worry Silver One Tairn interjects his tone resolved Everything is as it should be How can I help you Dain bites out his shoulders straightening I need you Xaden says to me Im sorry Dain retorts before I can even nod Relax he just wants to say goodbye I explain If youre saying goodbye its to him Xaden corrects nodding at Dain Im constructing my headquarters squad and youre coming with me So are Liam and Imogen My jaw unhinges Im what The fuck you are Dain barks stepping forward Shes a firstyear and Athebyne is beyond the wards Xaden blinks I dont hear you giving me the same argument about Mairi I look over my shoulder and sure enough Liam stands with his chin raised in front of Deigh Its almost as if he expected this What is going on I ask Xaden Liam is the best cadet among the firstyears even with you assigning him guard duty over Violet Dain argues folding his arms across his chest And Sorrengail wields lightning Xaden counters taking a step closer so his arm brushes my shoulder And not that I owe you an explanation secondyear because I dont but Sgaeyl and Tairn cant be separated for longer than a few days Of course Now it makes sense That you know of Dain exclaims Or can you honestly tell me Sgaeyl was at her wits end when you showed up at Montserrat Youve never fully tested how long they can be apart Feel like asking her yourself Xaden quips arching a brow A low growl rumbles as Sgaeyl stalks forward menace gleaming in her eyes My heart launches into my throat on Dains behalf It doesnt matter how often Im around hertheres always a part of me that sees her as the death sentence she is Dont do this Riders are known to die during War Games and shes safer with me Dain argues Anything could happen once were away from Basgiath let alone you taking her beyond the wards Im not dignifying that with a response This is an order Dains eyes narrow Or has this been your plan all along To separate her from her squad so you can use her to get your need for revenge on her mother Dain I shake my head at him You know thats not going to happen Do I he fires back Hes made a big deal out of the whole ifshediesIdie thing but do you know it for a fact Do you know Tairn wont survive your death Or has it all been a ploy to earn your trust Violet I suck in a sharp breath You need to stop right now Please do quit while youre behind Aetos Xaden seethes You want the truth Shes a fuck of a lot safer with me beyond the wards than she is with you within them We both know it The look in his eyes is similar to the one in Sgaeyls and it dawns on me why she chose him Theyre both ruthless both willing to annihilate whatever stands between them and what they want And Dain is in Xadens path Stop I put my hand on Xadens arm Xaden stop If you want me to go with you Ill go Its that simple His gaze shifts to meet mine and immediately softens No fucking way Dain whispers but it reverberates in my bones like a lightning strike I pivot dropping my hand from Xadens arm but its obvious by Dains expression that he now knows theres something between Xaden and meand hes hurt My stomach hits the ground Dain Him Dains eyes widen and his face flushes You andhim He shakes his head People talk and I thought thats all it was but you Disappointment drops his shoulders Dont go Violet Please Hes going to get you killed I know you think Xaden has ulterior motives but I trust him Hes had every opportunity and has never hurt me I move toward Dain At some point you have to let this go Dain looks horrified for a second but quickly masks it If hes what you choose He sighs Then I guess that has to be enough for me doesnt it Yes I nod Thank gods all this nonsense is about to be past us He swallows hard and leans in to whisper Ill miss you Violet Then he pivots on his heel and heads for Cath Thank you for trusting me Xaden says as I reach Tairns foreleg Always We have to ride He pauses like hes going to say more but turns away instead As he heads back to Sgaeyl I cant help but note both of the important men are walking away from me right now in opposite directions and given the one Ive chosen to follow my life is about to change forever The first known gryphon attack occurred in 1 AU After Unification near what is now the trading post of Resson At the edge of the dragonprotected border the post has always been vulnerable to attack and over the course of the past six centuries has changed hands no less than eleven times in what has become a neverending war to secure our borders from our powerhungry enemies Navarre an Unedited History by Colonel Lewis Markham CHAPTER THIRTYFOUR We fly into the morning and then the afternoon and when Andarna cant keep up she hooks on to Tairns harness midflight Shes asleep by the time Xaden chooses to skirt the thousandsfoothigh Cliffs of Dralor that give Tyrrendor a geological advantage over every province in the kingdomover every province on the Continent really and go around instead heading into the mountains north of Athebyne Theres a pulling sensation in my chest then a snap as we cross the barrier of the wards It feels different I tell Tairn Without the wards magic is wilder here Its easier for dragons to communicate within the wards The wingleader will have to take that into account when commanding his wing from this outpost Im sure hes already thought of that Its nearly one oclock in the afternoon when we approach Athebyne stopping at the orders of the dragons at a lake closest to the outpost so they can drink The surface of the lake is smooth as glass reflecting the jagged peaks in front of us with breathtaking accuracy before the riot lands on the shoreline and sends ripples over the water in tiny shock waves A thick forest of trees and heavy boulders surround one edge of the water and nearby grass is trampled which means were not the first riot to rest here There are ten dragons in all with us and though I might not recognize each one of them I know that Liam and I are the only firstyears in the group Deigh lands beside Tairn and Liam jumps from his seat like we havent just spent seven hours in the sky You both need to drink and probably eat something I tell them as I unbuckle from the saddle My thighs are sore and cramping but its not quite as bad as it was at Montserrat The extra hours in the saddle this last month have helped Tairn pops a talon onto a latch and Andarna plops to the ground shaking her head body then tail And you need to sleep Tairn replies Youve been up all night Ill sleep when you do Navigating his spikes carefully I slide down his foreleg to the mossy edge of the shore I can go for days without sleep Id rather you not fire off lightning bolts out of sleep deprivation Its on the tip of my tongue to retort that it takes effort to wield lightning but after I shattered Xadens window last night Im not sure I have any expertise on the subject Or maybe its just Xaden who makes me lose control Either way Im dangerous to be around Im surprised Carr hasnt given up on me Its strange to be beyond the wards I say changing the subject Tairns talons dig into the soil as Liam approaches stretching his neck high above his shoulders From the general agitation of the riot I wonder if its something they all feel this wrongness in the air that has the hairs on the back of my neck standing on end Were twenty minutes out from Athebyne so hydrate We have no idea what kind of scenario is waiting for us Xaden calls out his voice carrying over the squad You doing all right Liam asks coming my way as Tairn and Andarna both take the few steps they need to access the water Stay with Tairn I tell Andarna Shes a shiny target this far from the protection of the Vale I will Gods I should have left her at Basgiath What the hell was I thinking bringing her out here Shes just a kid and this flight has been grueling It was never your choice Tairn lectures Humans even bonded ones do not decide where dragons fly Even one as young as Andarna knows her own mind His words bring little comfort When push comes to shove Im responsible for her safety Violet Concern furrows Liams brow If I say Im not sure will you think less of me There are so many ways to answer that question Physically Im sore but fine but mentally Well Im a mess of anxiety and anticipation for what the War Games will bring We were warned the quadrant always loses ten percent of the graduating class in the final test but its more than that I just cant put my finger on it Id think youre being honest I glance to the left and see Xaden deep in conversation with Garrick Naturally the section leader made the cut for Xadens personal squad Xaden looks my way our eyes locking for a second and thats all it takes to remind my body that I had him naked a few hours ago the lines of his carved muscles straining against my skin Im so damned in love with that man How am I supposed to keep it off my face Just be professional Thats all I have to do Though the way Im hyperaware of each and every thing hes said and done since leaving his bedroom pretty much makes me a walking example of why firstyears shouldnt sleep with their wingleaders let alone fall in love with them Good thing hes only my wingleader for another week or so Keep looking at me like that and well be stopped longer than a half hour he warns without looking at me Promise His gaze whips my way and I swear I see him actually smile before turning back toward Garrick You doing all right with whatever is going on there Liam asks startling me And if I tell you Im not sure I give him the same answer my lips curving Id think you got yourself in over your head The look on his face is anything but teasing now For someone who said he owes Xaden everything thats not a glowing recommendation I drop my pack to the ground and roll the tense muscles of my shoulders Dont turn into Dain on me You feeling all right Xaden asks Fine Just a little sore The last thing I want to be is a burden for him Its not that Liam grimaces Its just that I know his priorities Im really sorry you got dragged along on my account I say quietly so the others wont hear You should be at one of the midland posts with Dain not being hauled past the wards Colonel Aetos is a fair man but I have no doubt this assignment is meant to give the marked wingleader his due I finish the last in a fair imitation of Dains dad and Liam rolls his eyes Im not scared no one is hauling me and believe it or not Violet sometimes my orders actually dont revolve solely around you I do have other skills you know he teases with a grin flashing a dimple as he hipchecks me Ive never once forgotten how amazing you are Liam And I mean it He coughs and I gesture him off Now I need a moment of privacy He bows with a wave of a hand as though introducing me to the forest behind us and I head off into their shadowy depths When I return to the shore of the lake Xaden walks away from Garrick and holds out his hand as he approaches My eyebrows rise Is he No He wouldnt Not in front of the eight other cadets He laces his fingers with mine Guess he would Its more than the touch of his skin that has my pulse leaping Hes breaking his own rule I glance pointedly toward where the others are gathered all in various states of relaxation by the shore but my hand tightens around his None of them is going to say a single word about youor us I trust every single person here with my life he says leading me toward a cluster of boulders almost twice his height on the far side of the lake People talk Let them Im not ashamed of loving him and I can handle any meanspirited gossip that comes my way You say that now His jaw flexes Did you get enough to drink Or eat I brought everything I needed in my pack You dont have to worry about me Worrying about you is ninetynine percent of what I do His thumb strokes the back of my hand When we make it to the outpost I want you to rest after we get our scenario objective Liam will stay while I most likely take the thirdyears out to patrol I want to help I immediately protest Wasnt that why he brought me For my lightning Not that Im exactly winning any accuracy awards but still You can after you rest up You have to be at full strength to wield that signet of yours or youll risk burning out Tairn is too powerful He makes a decent point but it doesnt mean I have to like it Once were out of sight of the others he backs me against the largest boulder and then lowers into a crouch before me What are you doing I run my fingers through his hair just because I can The fact that I get to touch this man is absolutely mindblowing and I plan on taking every advantage of the privilege while I can Your legs are stiff He starts at my calves working the knots loose with his strong hands I guess we cant really leave until the dragons are ready anyway right His touch feels downright decadent Right We have another ten minutes or so He flashes a wicked grin at me Ten minutes Considering we really have no idea what the rest of the day will bring Im more than happy to grab ahold of what time we have I groan as my muscles melt and my head falls back to rest on the boulder That hurts so wonderfully Thank you He laughs making his way up to the tense muscles of my thighs Trust me my motives arent altruistic Violence Ill take any excuse I can get to put my hands on you The scruff on his cheeks scrapes my palms as I slide my hands down the sides of his face to cup the back of his neck The feeling is more than mutual His breathing changes when he reaches the top of my thighs his fingers kneading my muscles into outright submission Im sorry about this morning What He looks up at me the sunlight catching the gold specks in his eyes and arches his scarred brow We were in the middle of something if you dont remember A slow smile spreads across my face Oh I remember The top button of his flight jacket is undone and I grip the fabric and tug him toward me At what point is this constant craving for him going to be assuaged Ive had him multiple times in the past twentyfour hours and could still go another roundor three Is it wrong to wish wed had time to finish Not sure Ill ever be finished He rises every plane of his body caressing mine on the way up Im way too fucking greedy when it comes to you He slants his head over mine and blurs out the rest of the world with a slow luxurious kiss His tongue slides between my parted lips to glide against mine like he has absolutely no other plans for the day but to memorize every corner of my mouth My entire body flares to life then starts to simmer when he kisses a path down my throat He palms my waist pulling my curves flush with his hard angles and Im nothing but heat and need My heart pounds so hard it sounds like wingbeats in my ears Gods Ill never get enough of this He groans one hand sliding to my ass Tell me what youre thinking I wind my arms around his neck I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room Oh yeah He draws back curiosity sparking in his eyes And what exactly was that A very dangerous addiction My gaze skims over the silver line of his scar the thick lashes so many women would kill for and over the bump in his nose to that perfectly sculpted mouth Ive already told him that I love him so its not like Im keeping secrets over here Hell compared to him Im an open book Impossible to sate His eyes darken Im going to keep you he promises just like he did last night Or was it this morning Youre mine Violet I lift my chin Only if youre mine Ive been yours for longer than you could ever imagine As if the words untether him he clutches the nape of my neck and kisses me long and hard stealing every breath every thought beyond the sweep of his tongue and the rising tide of need that heats my skin Xaden yanks his mouth away with a gasp breaking the kiss and cocking his head to the side as if listening for something Whats wrong I ask Hes gone rigid beneath my arms Shit His eyes widen as he drags his gaze back to mine Violet Im so sorry Is this seriously how you dragon riders spend your time a woman asks from behind Xaden her voice like velvet dragged over a gravel road He spins around so quickly hes a blur Shadows envelop me thick as a thundercloud I cant see shit Xaden someone yells and multiple pairs of feet come crashing through the brush Bodhi maybe Silly to hide whats already been seen the woman says her tone curt And if rumors are true theres only one silverhaired rider in your death factory of a college which means thats General Sorrengails youngest Fuck Xaden swears I need you to stay calm Violence Calm Shadows fall away and I leave my hands loose at my sides in case I need to grab a dagger or wield sidestepping Xaden so I can see A pair of gryphon riders stands in the meadow about thirty feet away their beasts eerily silent behind them Theyre a third of the size of our dragons but those beaks and claws look capable of shredding skin and scale just the same Tairn Coming Stay with Sgaeyl I order Andarna The gryphons look tasty from here she responds Theyre the same size you are No A fucking Sorrengail The woman looks only a few years older than me but she has the look of a veteran rider She arches a dark brow looking at me like Im something that needs to be shoveled out of the horse stalls The sound of beating wings fills the air as a handful of dragon riders barrel into the space around us Imogen Bodhi A thirdyear with a scarred lip I recognize Liam But no one is reaching for a weapon At least the odds are in our favor now Power unfurls under my skin and I throw open that Archives door letting energy rush over me in a torrent of scalding heat The sky crackles No Xaden turns and hauls me against his chest wrapping his arms around me and pinning my arms to my sides What are you doing I throw my weight against Xaden but its no use He has me locked down tight A gust of wind hits my right side as Tairn lands Holy shit that one is huge the woman says Around Xadens immovable arm I see the gryphon riders retreat with quick steps their eyes flying wide as they look up Xaden lifts one hand to cup the nape of my neck as I look up at him What the actual fuck is he doing Kissing me before we die If you have ever trusted me Violet I need you to do it now The plea in his eyes leaves me stunned Our enemies are feet away and he wants tohave a moment Just stay here Stay calm His eyes search mine for an answer to a question I havent been asked Then he passes me to Liam Passes me Like Im a damned rucksack Liam pins my arms to my sides with careful but unyielding strength Im sorry about this Violet Why the hell is everyone apologizing Let Me Go I demand as Xaden strides toward the pair of gryphon riders Garrick at his side Fear squeezes my heart like a vise that he thinks he can take on the gryphons and their riders himself I cant do that Liam apologizes his voice lowering I really wish I could Tairn roars from my right so hard that spit flies smacking Liam in the face and making my ears ring Liam drops his hands and backs away slowly putting his palms up Got it Point made No touching Free from his grip I spin toward the field as Xaden reaches the riders Youre fucking early he says And my heart stops In his last days of interrogation Fen Riorson lost touch with reality railing against the kingdom of Navarre He accused King Tauri and all who came before him of a conspiracy so vast so unspeakable that it does not bear repeating by this historian The execution was swift and merciful for a madman who cost untold lives Navarre an Unedited History by Colonel Lewis Markham CHAPTER THIRTYFIVE Somehow I manage to keep breathing which is impressive given my heart feels like it might shatter in a million pieces and narrow my gaze on the enemy Ive never seen a gryphon rider before The dragons usually burn them to ash along with their halfeagle halflion mounts What happened to meeting tomorrow We dont have a full shipment Xaden says to the gryphon rider his voice calm and even The shipment isnt the issue the woman says shaking her head Unlike our black the riders leathers are brown matching the darker feathers of their beastswho are currently staring at me like Im dinner If they try anything theyll be a snack Tairn says Shipment I barely process what Tairn says through the shock of the riders words And Xaden knows them Hes working with them aiding our enemy Betrayal cuts my throat like glass as I try to swallow This is why hes been sneaking off from the quadrant So you were waiting nearby to chat on the off chance that wed fly by a full day early Xaden asks We were patrolling from Draithus yesterdayits about an hour southeast from here I know where Draithus is Xaden retorts Never know you Navarrians act like nothing exists beyond your borders the male gryphon rider snarks I dont know why were bothering to warn them Warn us Xadens head cocks to the side We lost a village in the vicinity to a horde of venin two days ago They decimated everything I startle my eyes flying wide She just said what Venin never come this far west Imogen says from my left Venin Yep thats what they both said What the actual hell Id think someone was fucking with me if not for the two enormous gryphons looming behind the pair of riders But no one is laughing Until now the woman replies turning her gaze back to Xaden They were unmistakably venin and had one of their Dont say anything else Xaden interrupts You know that none of us can know the details or we put everything at risk All it takes is one of us being interrogated Are you getting this I ask Tairn glancing left and right to see if anyone else noticed the pure ridiculousness spewing from the womans mouth but everyone else lookshorrified like they actually believe a village was destroyed by mythical creatures Unfortunately yes Details or not it looks like the horde is heading north the male says Straight toward our trading post on the border across from your garrison at Athebyne Are you armed Were armed Xaden admits Then our job here is done Youve been warned the male says Now we have to go defend our people As it is this side trip only gives us about an hour to reach them in time Instantly the atmosphere changes intensifies and the riders around me seem to brace for something Xaden looks over his shoulder at me and instead of laughing at the utter absurdity of what theyre discussing his face is set in grim lines If you think youll ever convince a Sorrengail to risk their neck for anyone outside their own borders then youre a fool the man says with a sneer in my direction Power sizzles painfully beneath my skin demanding an outlet The man leans slightly to the side and looks me up and down in obvious judgment I wonder what your king would be willing to pay in order to get back the daughter of his most illustrious general Im willing to bet your ransom would be worth enough weaponry to defend all of Draithus for a decade Ransom Oh I think not Tairn snarls Fuck Bodhi mutters moving closer to me Try I dare you I crook my fingers at them releasing just enough power that light flashes within the clouds above us Shadows race menacingly from the pine trees on the edge of the meadow as Xaden raises his hands at his sides and both gryphon riders tense when the darkness pauses only inches from their feet You take a step toward that Sorrengail and youll be dead before you can even shift your weight Xaden says his voice dropping lethally Shes not up for discussion The woman glances at the shadows then sighs Well be there with the rest of our drift Just signal if you can get away from the disbelievers She walks away leading the man back toward their gryphons They mount within seconds and launch skyward Every head turns toward me with looks that vary from expectation to something akin to fear and my stomach sinks No one was surprised at the gryphon riders familiarity or throwing words like venin around And they all knew Xaden was aiding the enemy Im the outsider here Good luck Riorson Imogen tucks a piece of her pink hair behind her ear her rebellion relic peeking out above the sleeve of her flight leathers as she turns to give us space My stomach drops and my mind races grasping for anything but the obvious devastating truth as they all slowly follow Imogen back toward the lake Theres a rebellion relic winding up a thirdyears forearm as he passes in front of me Garricks here Hes a section leader but heshere not with any of the Flame Section squads So are Bodhi and Imogen That brunette rider with the nose ring is Soleil I think and thats definitely a relic on her left forearm The secondyear from Claw Section He has one too And LiamLiam is at my side Tairn I keep my breathing as even as possible as Xaden stares at me his face masked like an emotionless wingleader Silver One Tairns giant head swings in my direction They all carry rebellion relics I tell him Everyone in this squad besides me is the child of a separatist In the chaos of the flight field Xaden constructed an allmarked squad And theyre all Fucking Traitors And I fell for it I fell for him Yes They are he agrees resignation in his tone My chest threatens to cave in as it truly hits me This is so much worse than just Xaden betraying me betraying our entire kingdom Theres only one explanation as to why my own dragons have been so damned docile in the presence of the enemy You and Andarna lied to me too The treachery of it is too much and my shoulders dip from the weight of it You knew what he was doing We both chose you Andarna says like that makes it any better But you knew I look past where Liam dares to stare at me with sorrow to Tairn whose lethal focus lies straight ahead like he hasnt quite decided if hes going to burn Xaden alive or not Dragons are bound by bonds he explains as Xaden approaches There is only one other bond more sacred than that of a dragon and its rider A dragon and its mate Everyone knew but me Even my own dragons Oh gods is Dain right Has everything Xadens done been a ploy to earn my trust The sweet glow of happiness of love trust and affection that burned so brightly in my chest just a few minutes ago sputters painfully gasping for oxygen like a campfire put out by a bucket of water once it outlives its usefulness All I can do is watch as the embers drown and die Xaden watches me with increasing apprehension the closer he comes like Im some kind of cornered animal about to fight her way out with teeth and claws How was I ever foolish enough to trust him How did I ever fall for him My lungs ache and my heart screams This cant be happening I cant be this naive But I guess I am because here we are His entire body is a fucking warning especially the dark relic thats so glaringly visible on his neck right now His father may have been the Great Betrayer may have cost my brother his life but Xadens treachery cuts just as deep He flinches as my eyes narrow into a glare Were we ever really friends I whisper at Liam searching for the strength to yell We are friends Violet but I owe him everything Liam answers and when I glance up hes watching me with so much misery that I almost feel sorry for him Almost We all do And once you give him a chance to explain There it is Anger rushes to my aid overpowering the hurt You watched me train with him I shove at Liams chest and he stumbles backward through the grass You stood by and watched me fall for him Oh shit Bodhi laces his hands behind his thick neck Violence let me explain Xaden says Hes always known my true nature and honestly the shadows should have clued me in to his Hes a master of secrets Unspent power ripples in my very bones as I turn my back on Liam to face Xaden If you even think about touching me I swear Ill fucking kill you My power flares with my rage and lightning cracks across the sky jumping from cloud to cloud I think she means it Liam warns I know she does Xadens jaw ticks as our gazes collide and hold Everybody go back to the shore Now He watches me with apprehension as he draws closer I know what youre thinking Xaden says in that deceptively soft voice of his and theres a flicker of fear in those onyx depths You have no idea what Im thinking Fucking Traitor Youre thinking Ive betrayed our kingdom Logical guess Good for you Another bolt of lightning whips free streaking cloud to cloud Youre working with gryphon riders I leave my arms loose at my sides just in case I need my hands free to wield though I know Im no match for him Not yet Gods you are such a cliché Xaden Youre a villain hiding in plain fucking sight He winces Actually theyre called fliers Xaden says softly holding my gaze And I might be the villain to some but not you Im sorry Are we seriously arguing the semantics of your treason Dragons have riders and gryphons have fliers Which you know because youre in league with them I retreat a few steps so I dont act on the overwhelming urge to punch him in the face Youre working with our enemy Did you ever once stop to think that sometimes you can start out on the right side of a war and end up on the wrong one In this particular case No I point toward the shore I was trained as a scribe remember All weve done is defend our borders for six hundred years Theyre the ones who wont accept peace as a solution What shipments have you been giving them Weapons My stomach hits the ground That they use to kill dragon riders No He shakes his head emphatically These weapons are only to fight venin My jaw unhinges Venin are the stuff of fables Like the book my father I blink The letter What had he written Folklore is passed from one generation to the next to teach us about our past Was he trying to say No Thats impossible Theyre real Xaden says softly like hes trying to lessen a blow Youre saying people who can somehow tap into the source of magic without a dragon or gryphon to channel corrupting their power beyond all salvation actually exist I say the words slowly just so were crystal clear Theyre not just part of the creation fable Yes His forehead creases They drained all the magic out of the Barrens and then spread like an infestation Well at least thats in keeping with folklore I fold my arms across my chest What was the fable again One brother bonded to gryphon one to dragon and when the third grew jealous he drew directly from the source losing his soul and waging war on the other two Yes He sighs This was not how I wanted to tell you Assuming you were ever going to tell me I glance to where Tairn watches his head low as though he might have to incinerate Xaden at any moment Care to add to the discussion Not yet Id prefer you come to your own conclusion I chose you for your intelligence and courage Silver One Dont let me down I barely restrain myself from flipping the middle finger at my own dragon Fine Were I to believe venin exist and roam the Continent wielding dark magic then Id also have to believe they never attack Navarre because My eyes widen at the possibilitys logical conclusion Because our wards make all nondragon magic impossible Yes He shifts his weight Theyd be powerless the second they cross into Navarre Fuck that makes sense and I desperately dont want it to Which means I would have to believe that we have no clue that Poromiel is being relentlessly viciously attacked by dark wielders just beyond our borders My brow furrows He glances away and takes a deep breath before looking me in the eye Or you have to believe that we know and choose to do nothing about it Indignation lifts my chin Why the hell would we choose to do nothing about people being slaughtered It goes against everything we stand for Because the only thing that kills venin is the very thing powering our wards He doesnt say anything else as we stand there the only sound the water lapping against the shore in time with the echo of his words beating against the edges of my heart Is this why there have been raids along our borders Theyre looking for the material we use to power our wards I ask Not because I believe him not yet but because hes not trying to convince me The truth rarely needs effort my dad used to say He nods The material is forged into weapons to fight the venin Here take this Raising his right arm he takes a blackhandled dagger from the sheath at his side Im brutally aware of every move horrifyingly aware that hes been able to kill me whenever he wants and this moment is no different Though it would have been a swifter death if hed simply used one of the swords strapped across his back He moves slowly extending the dagger as an offering I take it noting the sharpened blade but its the alloy embedded into the runemarked hilt that makes me gasp You took this from my mothers desk My gaze jumps to his No Your mother probably has one for the same reason you should To defend against venin Theres so much pity in his eyes that my chest tightens The dagger The raids Its all right there But you told me there was no chance we could be fighting something like this I whisper clinging to the last of my hope that this is all a horrible joke No He moves closer reaching for me and then dropping his hand as if hes thought better of it I told you I would hope that if this threat was out there our leadership would tell us You twisted the truth to suit your needs My hand curls around the daggers hilt and I feel it hum with power Venin are real Venin Are Real Yes And I could lie to you Violence but Im not No matter what you think right now I have never lied to you Sure Right And how do I know this is the truth Because it hurts to think were the kind of kingdom that would do this It hurts to rearrange everything you think you know Lies are comforting Truth is painful I feel the hum of power within the blade and glare at Xaden You could have told me at any time but instead you hid everything from me He flinches Yes I should have told you months ago but I couldnt Im risking everything by telling you now Because you have to not because you want Because if your best friend sees this memory everything is lost he interrupts and I gasp You dont know that Dain wouldnt break a rule to save your life Violet What do you think hed do if he had this knowledge What would Dain do I have to believe he would not put the Codex above people suffering beyond our borders Or maybe I could have built shields that would have kept Dain from prying Or maybe he would continue to respect my boundaries and never look in the first place I narrow my eyes But well never know will we Because you didnt trust me to know the right thing to do Xaden did you He throws his hands wide This is bigger than you and me Violence And leadership will stop at nothing to sit behind their wards and keep the venin secret His voice is raw as he pleads I watched my own father executed trying to help these people I couldnt risk you too He leans into my space a little more with every word launching my pulse but Im done letting my heart make my heads choices You love me and Loved I correct him sidestepping so I can get some fucking space and then taking it Love he shouts stopping me in my tracks and earning us a glance from every rider within hearing distance You love me One of those little embers in my chest tries to come back to life and I squash it before it has the chance to burn Slowly I turn to face him Everything I feel I swallow fighting to hold on to the anger so I dont fall apart Felt for you was based on secrets and deception Shame burns in my cheeks that I was naive enough to fall for him in the first place Everything between us is real Violence The intensity with which he says it hurts my heart even more The rest I can explain with enough time But before we get to our assigned outpost I need to know if you believe me I glance at the dagger and hear the words in my fathers letter as surely as if hed spoken them I know youll make the right choice when the time comes He warned me the only way he could have through books Yes I say handing the dagger back to Xaden I believe you That doesnt mean I trust you anymore Keep it His posture softens in relief I sheathe it at my thigh Youre giving me a weapon after just telling me that youve been deceiving me for months Riorson Absolutely I have another and if what the fliers say is true and venin are headed north then you might need it I never lied when I said I cant live without you Violence He backs away slowly his lips curving in a sad smile And defenseless women have never been my type remember Im not remotely ready to joke around with him Lets just get to Athebyne He nods and a few minutes later were midflight We know we didnt lie We just didnt tell you everything Andarna says flying in the pocket of air behind Tairn with the least wind resistance as we make our way to the outpost Thats lying by omission I argue Theres a lot of that going around today Shes right Golden One Tension radiates through every line of Tairns body and the very beats of his wings You have every right to be angry He banks following the mountain range along the border The straps on my saddle bite into my thighs We made a choice to protect youwithout your consent It was an error and one that I wont make again The guilt he feels overwhelms my own emotions melting the hottest of my anger and I begin to think Really truly think If venin exist wed have record And yet there werent any copies of The Fables of the Barren in the Archivesthe one location Navarre should have a copy of every book written or transcribed in the last four hundred years which means Dad didnt just give me a rare bookbut a forbidden one Four hundred years of tomes and not a single one Four hundred years But our history spans over six Everything is a copy of an earlier work The only original text in the Archives older than four hundred yearsaround the time we fell into war with Poromielare the original scrolls from the Unification over six hundred years ago It only takes one desperate generation to change historyeven erase it Gods Dad spelled it all out for me Hed always told me scribes hold all the power Yes Tairn says as we curve around the last peak its jagged top bare of snow from the summer heat and the mountainside outpost of Athebyne comes into view at the same time as the Cliffs of Dralor One generation to change the text One generation chooses to teach that text The next grows and the lie becomes history He banks left following the curve of the mountain then slows as we approach the outposts flight field My hands grip the pommels when we land in front of the looming structure perched on the side of the last peak in this range Its design is identical to Montserrat a simple square fortress with four towers and walls barely thick enough to launch a dragon The military is nothing if not uniform I unbuckle from my saddle and slide down his foreleg And somehow were supposed to be able to concentrate on the War Games I mutter adjusting my pack on my shoulders thinking about a trading post that may or may not be under attack from mythical creatures soon The others dismount and I look back to see Andarna already curled up between Tairns feet Xaden walks with Garrick looking my way with what feels like longing I gave him everything and he never truly let me in Pain rips through my chest with the kind of cut that only heartbreak can give sharp and jagged I imagine this is what it feels like to be cleaved apart with a dull rustcovered blade Its not honed enough to slice quickly and theres a one hundred percent chance the wound is going to fester If I cant trust him theres no future for us Its more than tense as the ten of us walk beneath the open portcullis and into the outpost The very empty outpost What the hell Garrick strides across the courtyard in the center of the structure looking along the gathering spaces that should line the interior just like Montserrat Stop Xaden orders surveying the walls that rise on every side above us Theres no one here Divide and search He glances at me You dont leave my side I dont think this is a War Game I start to argue that he couldnt possibly know that but the whip of wind through the open gate makes me pause The only sounds in a fortress that should house more than two hundred people are our footsteps on the rocky groundand hes right Everything feels off Awesome I reply with more than a small dose of sarcasm and everyone but Liamwhos my shadow once againscatters in groups of two or three climbing various staircases This way Xaden says beelining for the southwest tower We climb and climb finally reaching the top of the fourth floor where the door leads us to an openair observation point that overlooks the valley below including the Poromish trading post This is one of the most strategic garrisons we man I say looking for any sight of the infantry and riders who should be here Theres no way theyd abandon it for War Games Thats exactly what Im afraid of Xaden looks out over the valley then narrows his eyes on the trading post a thousand feet below Liam On it Liam moves forward leaning on the stone battlement as he focuses on the structures in the distance beneath us The trading post is maybe a twentyminute walk along the wide gravelly path winding down the mountainside our outpost is perched on The roofs of several buildings just poke out above the circular stone wall of its defenses a drift of gryphons and their fliers approaching from the south Xaden turns on me and the look in his eyes is anything but welcoming What did Dain say to you before we left He leaned in and whispered something I blink trying to remember He said something like I search my memory Ill miss you Violet His body goes tense And he said I was going to get you killed Yes but he always says that I shrug What would Dain have to do with emptying an entire outpost I have something Garrick calls from the southeast tower holding what looks to be an envelope as he and Imogen cross the thick rampart coming in our direction Did you tell him about my trips here Xaden questions his eyes hardening No I shake my head Unlike some people I never hid anything from you He draws back his gaze shifting left and right as he thinks before settling on me again and widening Violence he says softly did Aetos touch you after I told you about Athebyne What My brow furrows and I shove an errant strand of hair out of my face as the wind swirls around us Like this He lifts his hand to my cheek His power requires touching someones face Did he touch you like this My lips part Yes but thats how he always touches me He would nnever I sputter I would know if he read my memories Xadens face falls and his hand slips downward cradling the back of my neck No Violence Trust me you wouldnt Theres no accusation in his tone just a resignation that hurts whats left of my heart He wouldnt I shake my head Dain is a lot of things but he would never violate me like that never take something I hadnt offered Except he tried once Its addressed to you Garrick says handing the envelope to Xaden Xaden drops his hand from my face and breaks the seal I can read the lettering as he opens the missive War Games for Xaden Riorson Wingleader of Fourth Wing I recognize the handwritinghow could I not when Ive seen it all my life Thats from Colonel Aetos What does it say Garrick asks folding his arms over his chest Whats our assignment Guys I see something just past the trading post Liam says from the battlement Oh shit Xadens face drains of all color and he crumples the missive in his fist before looking at me It says our mission is to survive if we can Oh gods Dain read my memories without my permission He must have told his father to where theyve been sneaking off Ive unknowingly betrayed Xadenbetrayed them all Thats not Garrick shakes his head Guys this is bad Liam shouts and Imogen races to his side This isnt your fault Xaden says to me then rips his gaze from mine and turns to his friends who are running down the ramparts to join us Weve been sent here to die For there in the land beyond the shadows were monsters that dwelled in the night and dined on the souls of children who wandered too close to the woods The Wyverns Cry The Fables of the Barren CHAPTER THIRTYSIX Xaden hands Garrick the missive and the rest of us rush to the battlements to see what were up against but I cant spot any threat in the valley below or the plains that stretch beyond for miles before the Cliffs of Dralor Something is off Tairn says I felt it at the lake but its stronger here Can you pinpoint what it is I reply as panic creeps up my throat If Dains dad knows Xaden and the others have been supplying weapons to the gryphon fliers theres every chance this is an execution Its coming from the valley below I cant see shit down there Bodhi says leaning over the edge of the masonry Well I can Liam replies and if those are what I think they are were fucked Dont tell me what you think they aretell me what youre sure of Xaden orders The letter says this is a test of your command the section leader reads behind us You have the choice of abandoning the village of our enemy or abandoning command of your wing What the hell does that mean Bodhi reaches back and takes the letter Theyre testing our loyalty without actually saying it Xaden folds his arms over his chest standing at my side According to the missive if we leave now well make it to the new location of headquarters for Fourth Wing at Eltuval in time to carry out our orders for War Games but if we leave the trading post of Resson and its occupants will be destroyed By what Imogen asks Venin Liam responds My stomach drops Youre positive Xaden asks Liam nods As sure as I can be without having actually seen them before Four of them Purple robes Distended red veins spidering all around bright red eyes Creepy as shit Sounds about right Xadens weight shifts I liked it better when we just delivered the weapons Bodhi mutters Oh and one guy with a giantass staff Liam continues And I swear to Dunne one second the plain was clear and the next they were justthere walking toward the gates His eyes are wide his pupils blown as he uses his signet to see to the bottom of the valley Red veins Imogen asks Because magic corrupts their blood as they lose their souls I murmur looking up at Xaden wondering if he remembers what Andarna said the night we took the tunnel to the flight field Nature likes everything in balance Every head but Liams swings my way If the fables are true at least A part of me hopes they are or I know next to nothing about the enemy below Of course if theyre true Seven gryphons have landed next to us Tairn tells me Everyone else stiffens no doubt receiving the same message from their dragons Andarna stay with Tairn I say Xaden might trust the fliers but Andarna is damn near defenseless All right she answers The guy with the staff just Liam starts An explosion sounds echoing up the sparsely treed valley followed by a plume of blue smoke My heart jolts at the sight Those were the gates he finishes How many people live in Resson Bodhi asks More than three hundred Imogen answers as another boom cracks through the valley Thats the post they do the yearly trades at Then lets get down there Bodhi turns and Xaden steps back blocking his path with an outstretched hand Youre kidding me right We have no idea what were walking into Xadens tone reminds me of that first day after Parapet Hes in full command mode So we should just stand here while civilians die Bodhi questions and I tense We all do watching Xaden Thats not what Im saying Xaden shakes his head He has to choose Thats what the War Games missive said He can abandon that village or his command whos now waiting for him at Eltuval This isnt a fucking training exercise Bodhi Someif not allof us are going to die if we go down there If wed been assigned to an active wing there would be far older more experienced leadership making this decision but there arent If we werent marked with rebellion relics if we hadnt been aiding the enemyhis gaze darts to mine brieflywe wouldnt even be here with this choice So all command structure aside what are your thoughts We have the numbers Soleil says narrowing her brown eyes on the field and tapping her bright green fingernails rhythmically on the stone crenelations of the battlement And air superiority At least there arent any wyvern I scan the skies just to be sure Uh What Bodhis eyebrows rise Wyvern Fables say venin created them to compete with dragons and instead of channeling from them channel power into them Lets hope theres something in that book that isnt true Yeah lets not borrow trouble Xaden shoots a look sideways at me then studies the sky There are four venin and ten of us Garrick says walking away from the edge of the battlement We have the weapons to kill them Liam says turning his back on the valley And Deigh told me seven gryphon fliers Were here the older brunette from the lake says striding down the battlement from the southeast corner of the outpost I left the rest of the drift outside once we noticed that your outpost seems to beabandoned She glances over the rampart at the clouds of smoke rising from the valley beneath with a look of resignation her shoulders dipping Im not going to ask you to fight with us Youre not Garricks eyebrows rise No She gives him a sad smile Four of them is tantamount to a death sentence The rest of my drift are making peace with our gods She turns toward Xaden I came to tell you to leave You have no clue what theyre capable of wielding It only took two of them to bring down an entire city last month Two Of Them We lost two drifts trying to stop them If therere four down there She shakes her head Theyre after something and theyre going to kill every single person in Resson to get it Take your riot and go home while you can Fear squeezes my chest but my heart aches at the thought of leaving them to die It goes against everything we stand for even if they arent Navarrian civilians We have dragons Imogen says her pitch rising Surely that has to count for something Were not afraid to fight Are you afraid to die Have any of you seen combat The brunettes gaze sweeps over us and suddenly I feelyoung as we reply with our silence Thought not Your dragons do count for something They can fly you far and fast Dragon fire wont kill them Only the daggers youve been bringing and we have those She looks at Xaden Thank you for everything youve done Youve kept us alive these last couple of years and given us a fighting chance Youre going down there to die Xaden says matteroffactly Yes She nods as another explosion sounds Get your riot out of here Fast Pivoting on her heel she strides back down the rampart her head held high before she disappears into the tower on the opposite end Xadens jaw clenches and I can see the battle raging in his eyes An unbearable heaviness settles in my stomach If we leave theyll all die Every civilian Every flier We wont have killed them but well be complicit in their deaths all the same If we fight well likely die with them We can live as cowards or die as riders Xadens shoulders straighten and the rock in my stomach turns to nausea Hes made a decision I can see it in the lines of his face the resolve in his posture Sgaeyl says she has never run from a fight and today will not be the first And Im not going to stand by while innocent people are dying either He shakes his head But Im not going to order any of you to join me Im responsible for all of you None of you crossed that parapet because you wanted to None of you You crossed it because I made a deal Im the one who forced you into the quadrant so I wont think less of anyone who wants to fly for Eltuval instead Make your choice He tears his hand through his hair I dont want you in harms way In a perfect world that would be all I need to hear If the others get to make a choice then so do I His jaw flexes Were riders Imogen says as another explosion sounds We defend the defenseless Thats what we do You saved every single one of us here cousin Bodhi says And were thankful Now Id like to do what weve trained for and if it means I dont go home then I guess my soul will be commended to Malek I wouldnt mind seeing my mother anyway Ill tell you the same thing I did after Threshing our first year when we decided to start smuggling weaponry out Garrick says You kept us alive all these years we get to decide how we die Im with you Exactly Soleil says drumming her fingertips just above the dagger sheathed at her thigh Im in Liam steps forward so he stands at my side We watched as our parents were executed because they had the courage to do the right thing Id like to think my death would be just as honorable My chest tightens Their parents died to expose the truth while mine sacrificed my brother to keep this heinous secret Agreed Imogen nods They all do One by one everyone agrees until theres only me Xaden captures my gaze If you think youll ever convince a Sorrengail to risk their neck for anyone outside their own borders then youre a fool Isnt that what the flier said at the lake Fuck that Tairn Its not just me going to war We will feast on their bones Silver One Graphic but point made I will not leave innocent people to die no matter what side of the border they live on I will not let my squadmates risk their lives while I run despite the plea I see in Xadens eyes At least Rhiannon Sawyer and Ridoc arent here Theyll live to be secondyears Mira will understand I have no doubt that she would do the same And as for Mom The dagger on her desk means she knows and has done nothing to stop it Guess Ill be the second child she sacrifices to keep the existence of venin a secret Ive been defenseless I tell Xaden lifting my chin And now Im a rider Riders fight The others shout in agreement A thousand emotions cross his face but Xaden only nods as he walks toward the battlements Liam Give me a report His foster brother moves to his side and focuses The fliers are engaged all sevensix of them Looks like theyre trying to draw fire away from the civilians but damn the venin are wielding a kind of fire Ive never seen among riders Three surround the city and one is making his way toward a structure in the middle A clock tower Xaden nods then divides us according to objectives Garrick and Soleil will do a perimeter sweep for reconnaissance while the rest of us target the venin on various sides of Resson keeping an eye on the advance on the clock tower as we near it on each pass through town The only way to take them out is by dagger That means well have to dismount and fight once we get the townspeople to whatever safety we can find Garrick adds his face set in grim lines Dont throw your only weapons unless youre certain of your aim Xaden nods Save as many people as you can Lets go We make our way down the steps and through the silent courtyard Xaden leading the way When we emerge from the outpost our dragons wait all perched on the edge of the ridgeline shifting their weight in agitation as they survey the trading post below I walk directly between Tairn and Sgaeyl I knew youd make the right choice Sgaeyl says glancing toward where Xaden approaches with Liam their footsteps dangerously close to the cliffside at my left He did too Even if he doesnt like you putting yourself in danger he knew you would Well he knows me a great deal better than I know him I lift a brow at her She blinks Youre a far cry from the trembling girl who stood in the courtyard and tried to mask her fear after Parapet I approve I wasnt asking for your approval If Im going to die I might as well be honest in my last moments She chuffs and nudges Tairns head with hers but hes solely focused on the trading post The rocky terrain crunches under my boots as I walk beneath Tairn to where Andarna stands between his forelegs watching the attack unfold beneath us I put myself right in front of her blocking her view of what has to be carnage Stay here and hide Im not taking a kid into battle period Stay here she grumbles sarcastically in response I bite back a sad smile Its really too bad I wont get to see her go through her rebellious adolescent years Agreed Tairn dips a shoulder for me Youre a target little one I mean it I order Andarna stroking my hand over her scaly nose If were not back by morning or if you think venin are approaching you fly home to the Vale Get behind the wards no matter what Her nostrils flare Im not leaving you My chest hurts so badly I fight the urge to rub the area above my heart but I square my shoulders instead It has to be said Youll feel the moment when youll know that theres nothing to leave And it might break your heart but when you feel it you fly Promise me youll fly Heartbeats pass before Andarna finally nods Go I whisper stroking her beautiful jaw one last time Shell be fine Shell make it back to the Vale I cant let myself believe any differently She turns around and heads for the outpost and I pull my shit together and walk between Tairns forelegs taking one last quick look at the valley Xaden and Liam stand to my right doing the same A screech rends the air and an enormous gray dragon emerges from a valley two ridgelines to the southacross the Poromish border It tucks its two legs up under its massive body as it flies away from us heading straight for Resson Do we have a riot nearby Liam asks No Xaden answers Its as though the ground beneath my feet shifts I could have sworn I saw a riot of dragons across the border Isnt that what Mira said at Montserrat The dragon shrieks again spewing a streak of blue fire down the mountainside setting some of the smaller trees on fire before it reaches the plains where Resson stands Blue Fire No No No Wyvern My heart launches into my throat Xaden it has two legs not four Its not a dragon Its a wyvern Maybe if I say it a few more times Ill believe what Im seeing Holy Shit Is this what leadership has been redacting Theyre supposed to be myth not fleshandblood beings But then again so are venin Well there went our air superiority Imogen says across from us then shrugs Fuck em They can die too They have created abominations Tairn says a low growl rumbling in his chest Did you know I suspected Why do you think Ive been so hard on you during flight maneuvers You and I are going to have to work on our communication skills Guess we know all the details now Liam says Anyone want to change their minds Xaden asks down the line None of us answer No Then mount up I walk toward Tairns shoulder as Xaden strides over to me Turn around Violence he orders and I pivot looking up at him He unsheathes one of his daggers and slides it in the empty spot I have at my ribs Now you have two Youre not going to lecture me about staying safe in the outpost I ask my emotions rioting at his nearness He hid all of this from me and yet my chest aches just looking at him If I asked you to stay behind would you His eyes bore into mine No Exactly I try not to pick fights I know I cant win My eyes flare Speaking of knowing youll win fights General Melgren will know whats happened here Hell be able to see the outcome of the battle even now He shakes his head slowly and points to his neck to the rebellion relic snaking around his throat Do you remember how I told you I realized it was a gift not a curse Yes Back when I was in his bed Just trust mebecause of this Melgren cant see a fucking thing My lips part remembering Melgren saying he liked to lay eyes on Xaden once a year Any other secrets youre keeping from me Yes He cups my neck and leans into my space Stay alive and I promise Ill tell you whatever you want to know The simple confession makes my heart clench As angry as I am I cant imagine a world without him in it I need you to survive this even if I hate that I still love you I can live with that A corner of his mouth lifts as he drops his hand and turns away from me heading toward Sgaeyl Tairn dips his shoulder again and I mount settling into the saddle and strapping my thighs in after I secure my pack behind the seat Its time Find a good hiding place Andarna I cant stand the thought of you being hurt Go for the throat she says walking into the abandoned outpost Sgaeyl launches to my right and I hold the pommels tight when Tairn springs skyward with great heavy beats of his wings Theres something in that trading post We all feel it Tairn says as he banks with Sgaeyl plummeting from the ridgeline into a steep dive that leaves my stomach behind The saddle straps dig into my thighs but they do their job and keep me seated as I lower my riding goggles to shield my eyes from the wind We fly into the shade the sun sinking behind the Cliffs of Dralor and throwing the afternoon into shadow Another explosion hits this time taking out a chunk of the posts high stone walls as Tairn pulls up narrowly missing a gryphon rider and bringing us level across the post flying too fast to hear anything more than the screams of townspeople as they run through the streets fleeing for the exodus at the post gates Where did the wyvern go I ask Tairn Retreated into the valley Dont worryit will come back Oh Joy My gaze sweeps the rooftops of the little post until I see ithimwhatever Theres a figure standing at the top of a wooden clock tower wearing purple floorlength robes that billow in the wind while he hurls blue flames like daggers at the civilians below Hes more terrifying than any illustrator could have depicted rivers of red veins fanning in every direction around soulless eyes consumed by magic His face is gaunt with sharp cheekbones and thin lips a gnarled hand gripping a long red cane made of some misshapen wood Tairn Yes lets Tairn banks away from Sgaeyl pulling us in a hard turn and taking us into the village A few beats of his wings later fire streams from his mouth and he incinerates the clock tower on a flyby Got him I turn in the saddle watching as the wooden structure collapses in the blast Its only a matter of seconds before the venin walks out of the flames though and there isnt a scratch on him Oh fuck Hes still there I call out as we cut back across the post to get to our assigned area mentally kicking myself for thinking it could have been that simple Theres a reason these creatures are what make up most Navarrians nightmare storiesand it isnt because theyre easy to kill We have to get close enough to get a dagger in him I turn forward just in time to see a giant mass of wings and teeth cut across our path with an earsplitting screech and Tairns tail smashes into the stone walls behind me knocking the masonry loose as he dodges the wyvern We just barely evade the hissing curl of blue fire that streams from its mouth catching a nearby tree on fire The wyvern is back Thats a different one Tairn barks Im relaying orders to the others Of course he is Xaden might command the riders on this field but Tairn is clearly leading the dragons The wyvern swings around and heads toward the towns center tucking up two legs and beating spiderwebbed wings It bears a female rider in maroon flight gear that resembles our own and her eyes are the same eerie red color as the venin on the clock tower Xaden theres more than one wyvern Theres a moment of silence but I can feel Xadens palpable shock then rage If you get separated from Tairn call out then fight until I get there No chance of that happening Im not letting her off my back wingleader Tairn growls as I get my first good look at the airspace above the city flooded with dragons gryphons and wyvern just like in the creation fable Soleil found a sealed entrance to what looks to be a mine Xaden says I need Tairn turns abruptly veering toward the mountains you to see if you can put down some cover so Garrick and Bodhi can get the townspeople evacuated he finishes Liam is on his way On it My pulse leaps Tairn I cant aim You will he says like its a foregone conclusion Orders are being dispersed amid the gryphons Dragons can speak to gryphons My eyebrows shoot up Naturally How do you think we communicated before humans got involved I hunker down across his neck as we dart above the city passing over a clinic what looks to be a school and rows and rows of an openair market thats currently on fire Theres no sign of the purplerobed venin we first saw as we sail over the shriveled body of a gryphon and its rider near the center of town My stomach turns especially when I see a wyvern circling back toward themand Sgaeyl is on an intercept course She can hold her own Tairn reminds me And so can he We have orders Focus Focus Right We pass families scurrying from their ruined homes then over the city walls heading toward the opening in the side of the mountain where Soleils Brown Clubtail swings its tail into the wood planks covering the abandoned tunnel There are a few outbuildings lining the road but not much else Tairn pulls hard to the left as we approach the strap digging into my legs as my weight shifts in the saddle with the abrupt motion Then he flares his wings to hover in front of Soleil facing Resson and the screaming crowd that runs the hundred yards between the city walls and us led by a pair of gryphons and their fliers who continuously look behind them scanning the skies But what they dont see is the venin striding our way from north of the gate watching the crowds movement with a narrowed red gaze The veins on both sides of her eyes are more pronounced than the earlier riders and her long blue robe reminds me of the staff bearer who survived the clocktower blast Ive already told Fuil Shell protect Soleil Tairn says angling toward the threat Get us away from the crowd Power already sizzles beneath my skin A child stumbles on the dirt road and my heart lurches as her father scoops her into his arms and continues to sprint Deigh passes and I see him land out of the corner of my eye as I lift my arms and let my power rip free focusing on the venin Lightning cracks A section of the city wall crumbles Fuck Keep going Deigh says they need more time Tairn urges I make the mistake of turning in the saddle noting that both Liam and Soleil are unseated ushering the townspeople into the mine while Deigh and Fuil guard separate sides of the evacuation path If anything happensif one of those wyvern circling the town decides to take noticetheyre vulnerable But so are the people theyre protecting A trio of gryphons flies in all three dangling townspeople from their talons dropping them off at the entrance to the mine and looping back for another run Energy rips through me as I aim a bolt for the venin this one shattering an outbuilding along the hillside to our right Boards split and wood flies as it collapses The venins attention whips upward and my stomach twists when she spots me Theres pure malice in her red eyes as she reaches forward with her left hand then flips it fisting air Rocks tumble down the mountainside Soleil throws up her hands stopping the slide before it can crush the people running into the mine below Her arms shake but the boulders fall on either side of the evacuation path leaving the escape clear I whip back toward the venin and gasp Raw power is palpable in the air lifting the hairs on my arms as the venin stands with her palms lowered to the ground The grass around her turns brown then the flowers of the wild clover bushes wilt and the leaves curl losing all their color Tairn is she Channeling he growls I fling another flare of energy as the blight spreads outward from the venin as though shes draining the very essence of the land but it hits too close to the road and the straggler racing toward safety for my comfort Watch out Deigh says that building on the other side of the road has a crate of something marked with Liams family crest Tairn tells me as I fire off another blast that lands nowhere near the venin He says its highlyunstable he finishes pausing as he relays the information Not worried about the building I reply as the circle of death expands under Tairns beating wings and I draw more power from Tairn poising to strike again Soleil charges toward the venin with Fuil on her heels her dagger palmed and ready as the rest of the group of townspeople make it into the tunnel This is all worth it as long as they survive The wave of death pushes forward from the venin flowing outward and catching up with the fleeing civilian in the middle of the road He falls then screams soundlessly curling in on himself as his body becomes nothing but a husk of a shell Air freezes in my lungs and my heart stutters The venin just Soleil I yell but its already too late The thirdyear stumbles a few steps into the dead zone her dragon reaching for her as they both buckle and fall Fuil throwing up a cloud of dirt with her heavy impact They desiccate in a matter of seconds their bodies shriveling A vise clamps around my chest and for a second I cant breathe The venin has even more power now Tell Deigh I look back over my shoulder to see Liam sprinting for Deigh He needs time Already done Tairn rolls left as a fireball churns up at us the first of a volley that causes us to retreat across the road We lost Soleil I tell Xaden The only acknowledgment is a wave of sorrow and I know its his The gryphons take flight their riders wielding what looks to be lesser magic at the venin as two wyvern approach both riderless Tell them to change tactics They dont stand a chance if they cant get close to that venin I tell Tairn The gryphons change course and I loose my power again hitting closer to the venin She glares up at me then turns at the sound of flapping wings Garrick and the other marked thirdyears are coming Shes outnumbered and damn I hope she knows it The gryphons team up tearing into one of the approaching wyvern as Liam mounts and Deigh launches escaping the spreading ring of death but the other wyvern dips low heading for the venin Right on course to pass by the outbuilding You said that building has unstable material in it right I ask Yes I cant be sure Ill hit it but Excellent idea Tairn puts us into position hovering about twenty feet aboveground as Liam flies for the gryphons above us wielding spears of ice into the injured wyverns throat Blood streams as the wyvern falls from the sky with an earpiercing cry One down The venin reaches the road and the wyvern skids to a landing on the dirt path so she can mount Now I shout Tairn breathes in deep and exhales pure fire as the wyvern takes off sending the outbuilding up in a blaze that ignites whatever is within Heat rushes my face singeing my cheek as the building explodes engulfing everything around it The firestorm nearly catches us but Tairn banks left narrowly missing the blast I shout throwing up my fist as we circle back the wind easing the sting in my cheek We have one wyvern down a good share of the townspeople evacuated and theres no way anything survived that blast Tairn dips his right wing low and we turn sharply getting set up to make another run through town I glance to the right and gasp Not only did that blast not kill the wyvern but its rider is alive and well too flying toward Shit Shit Shit There are more wyvern than dragons exiting the valley to the south and Im trying hard not to panic when blazinghot blue fire streams past us I pivot in the saddle and see a wyvern on our tail approaching frighteningly fast as we circle the post walls Any idea how to kill that many wyvern I ask Tairn panic sitting on my chest like an anchor that threatens to pull me under into the chaos of my thoughts There are at least six wyvern from what I can see all with terrifying wingspans and sharp teeth and theyre heading straight for us The same methods that can kill us Tairn says leading the wyvern away from the posts center where Garrick and Bodhi are both on foot chasing down the venin from the clock tower daggers in hand I dont exactly have a crossbolt handy No but you do have lightning and a bolt of that will stop any dragons heart Tell me you warned the others how Soleil and Fuil died Everyone touching the ground is vulnerable They all know what they risk Gods there are still kids down there some screaming others heartbreakingly silent as their mothers drag their dead bodies from the streets There are no words We need to draw them away from the city I tell Xaden turning back in the saddle as far as the bands across my thighs will let me to get a better vantage point of the airspace and the wyvern some of which seemed to have slowed in order to circle the remains of the clock tower Whatever they want must be there Tairn says Agreed on both counts Do what you can to give the rest time to evacuate Xaden responds Were clearing the edge of town now He pauses and a ripple of worry pushes through our emotional barrier Try not to die Working on it A wyvern dives only to climb again with a human leg hanging from between its teeth We circle back then head south through the trading post away from the citys center and whatever Bodhi and Garrick are doing Theyre not following Tairn grunts Well need to draw them out That venin didnt seem to like when I wielded lightning Youre a threat So lets get their attention and threaten He growls in approval I open the floodgates of Tairns power letting it roil and billow beneath my skin As soon as were outside the walls I throw my hands up and let it burst free Lightning streaks the sky earning us the notice of the horde of wyvern one of which peels off its flight pattern and soars in our direction its poisonbarbed tails flicking behind it Maybe this wasnt the best idea Were committed now Tairn reminds me Right Theyre finally outside the city walls I summon more power and wield my arms trembling with the effort to control the deluge of raw energy Lightning strikes once missing the wyvern by more than Id like to admit Dread fills my mouth with the taste of ash Im not ready for this Try again I dont have enough control Try again Tairn demands I wield again ripping down the walls between Tairn and me and more of the energy he channels rips through me Lightning splits the duskhued sky in a blast so bright I blink Again I let the power overcome me again and again concentrating on the location of the wyvern as Tairn dodges blasts of blue fire Finally a strike hits the one behind us dropping him from the sky It hits the hillside with a satisfying crash What about the venin its bonded to I tremble with the effort of controlling the power fighting to keep it from overtaking me Sweat drips down my face Hopefully theyre like us Kill the wyvern and the rider dies but its hard to tell with so many riderless ones Hopefully isnt the best word right now I turn in the saddle and watch in horror as two more riderless wyvern fly out of the valley The civilians need more time to reach the mine Lets give it to them Tairn growls in agreement and we speed back over the post Xaden has one wyvern by the throat strangling it with shadows as a thirdyear hurls ice at its rider and the other four are doing everything they can to drive the newcomers back with a combination of dragon fire and magic Power jolts through me in wave after burning wave as I wield more lightning than I ever have in practice I swing my arm around and aim another bolt at a wyvern flying near the front gateor what used to be the front gate I miss the wyvern but hit an empty tower sending stone flying in all directions a large chunk hitting a wyvern in the tail and causing it to spin in midair Tairn banks another hard turn and we come back around I take a deep breath then call a lightning boltthis one striking a wyvern directly in its upper back with a satisfying sizzle The giant beast shrieks then smashes into a nearby hillside with a thunderous boom Coming back around again for another pass and heady from my recent kill I throw out three more bolts of lightning in quick succession Unfortunately more speed doesnt translate to more accuracy and the adrenaline rush isnt helping my aim either I manage to cause three more alarming explosions thoughone of which distracts a rather large wyvern that had been on Bodhis tail giving him a moments advantage which his dragon seizes by banking hard left and coming up behind the wyvern and sinking its teeth into its leathery gray neck Theres an ominous crack and then Bodhis dragon releases the wyverns lifeless body letting it fall to the ground fifty feet below On the left I shout as two more wyvern come into view on our rear flank I leave the evasive maneuvers up to Tairn and concentrate on bringing down as many strikes as possible as the wyvern gain speed on us My arms tremble growing weaker and weaker with each bolt I try to control to keep from hitting our own riders Sgaeyl is on the west side of the outpost and my heart crawls into my throat when she flies low and Xaden does an impressive running jump off her back landing with a roll onto the street below Almost immediately shadows pull in every direction and cover the people screaming as they try to run for cover from the snarling jaws of a hungry wyvern One of the wyvern on my tail must notice Xaden out of the saddle because it tucks its wings for a moment diving for the ground only to widen them and pull out at the last minute gliding mere feet above the silky shadows Shit Its heading straight for Xaden its jaws opening wide as though it plans to just snatch Xaden up like a quick bite to eat Xaden I scream out loud but hes already noticed the wyvern throwing a rope of shadows high above the buildings in a perfect lasso around Sgaeyls head and she yanks him up off the ground and out of the path of the oncoming wyvern One minute Xaden is dangling from the shadow rope and the next hes back in his saddle as Sgaeyl banks for another low pass through town But I was so focused on Xaden I completely forgot about the wyvern on my own tail Tairn hasnt though and starts to climb higher and higher leading the wyvern from the post as he gains altitude nauseatingly fast Violence Xaden screams Beneath you I look down and gasp A stream of blue fire billows up toward us Bank Tairn rolls left and my ass leaves the saddle held in only by the straps as he rolls us upside down to narrowly avoid the blast But when he straightens the wyvern is still on us My heart lurches into my throat as its mouth gapes open its sharp bloodied teeth snapping as it lunges for Tairns side No I lift my arms to throw a bolt in its direction and prepare for impact A blur of blue shoots between us and the wyvern is knocked away by the body of a navy dragonSgaeyl Her jaws tear through the side of the wyvern in several rapid brutal bites flesh ripping and blood spraying in the most vicious midair meal I have ever seen Then she flips and catches the devoured wyvern by the head with her daggertail sending its dead body sailing several hundred feet before crashing to the ground Sgaeyl picks up speed banks and flies right by us her wing gliding under Tairns almost affectionatelywhich is in complete contrast to the menacing glare that seems directed at me wyvern blood still dripping from her jaws Message received Its her job to keep an eye on Xadens back and mine is to watch Tairns I do a quick turn in my saddle checking all our sides for more wyvern then tell Tairn Lets climb so we can get a better count of what were facing Weve barely made it a hundred feet above the town when I spy Liam and Deigh flying hard and fast in the opposite direction with a venin riding a wyvern on his tail Liam needs help I rush to explain On it Tairn says flipping us in midair We hang in the sky for a second before his massive wings catch the air and turn us so that were heading straight for Liam The venin raises a staff of some sort sending balls of blue flame at Deigh but he manages to avoid them all as Liam stands up and runs along Deighs spine toward his daggertail At the last second Deigh uses his tail to whip Liam up into the air toward the wyvern I dont even have time to scream before he lands in a crouch on the wyverns rear and pulls out one of the runed daggers like the two Xaden gave me The venin whips around raising his staff but Liam is brutally fast and slits the venins throat with sickening precision The wyvern stops beating its wings within seconds its heavy body freefalling to the ground and Liam leaps from his back just as Deigh flies beneath easily catching him A wyvern flies at us from the left approaching with great beats of its wings Tairn Power fills my veins and I lift my hands but Tairn rolls flipping my world upside down as he rakes his claws and morningstartail along the wyvern from throat to tail splitting it open in midair then leveling out as the wyvern streaks a bloody path to the ground The rush in my head is a result of more than Tairns acrobatics For the first time since we agreed to try to defend the civilians in this trading post since we were told there were four venin and no way we could win a little bit of the panic sitting on my chest starts to ease We might actually be able to survive today Maybe Just then another wyvern drops out of a cloud above us diving at Tairn gaining speed as it tucks in its wings becoming a teethtipped spear Theres no time for evasive maneuvers Its seconds awaybut red fills my vision and Deigh is there driving into the side of the massive gray beast Theres no breath of relief as the collision sends Liam hurtling off Deighs back and across the base of Tairns neck at breakneck velocity Violet Liam I catch his scrambling hands as he slides by and hold on a cry escaping as my shoulders pop and subluxate from the strain of catching his weight and Tairn pitches in a sharp turn to follow Deigh Hold on Grimacing Liam crawls forward on his elbows despite the impossible angle then grasps the pommels of the saddle I throw myself over him sheltering his head and holding on with everything I have as Tairn rolls and banks to keep close but clear of Deigh and the massive gray wyvern Locked in battle only a few feet away their talons shred through the scales of the other amid snapping teethand Deighs catastrophic roars of pain Theyre too close for me to act and theres no guarantee Ill hit the wyvern and not Deigh with my lightning Theres nothing I can do but secure Liam Grabbing the lap belt I never use I wind it around Liams torso and buckle it That should hold you until we can get you back to Deigh but I cant wield without hitting him I yell as wind whips around us The agony in his eyes steals my breath Why did you do that I cry my fingers searching for purchase on his leathers to pull him closer I settle for the back of his collar and yank Why would you risk it Gods if anything happens to them His gaze collides with mine That thing was going to take a chunk out of Tairn Youve saved my life and now its my turn No matter what you think of me for keeping secrets were friends Violet Response is impossible as Tairn rolls again lifting Liams entire body and the leather belt slips to just under his arms I fist my hands in the back of his flight leathers but theres not much to grab on to Heartbeats pass and I cant breathe cant think past the desperation to keep Liam safe until Tairn levels out again trying to stay as close as he can to Deigh without risking any of us in the process But then Deighs scream slices me to the bone as the two lock into a dive Cant you do something I beg Tairn Working on it He pitches right and plummets positioning himself around the downwardspiraling duel to strike It should be us fighting for our lives not Liam and Deigh And gods Deigh is losing which means Liam My throat constricts No Not going to happen Get over here I shout at Xaden Energy crackles through my hands but theres no clear target Theyre moving too fast Im hunting the venin at the walls he answers Deigh is fighting for his life The heartbeat of terror squeezing my chest like a vise isnt mine Its Xadens If I leave these civilians are all dead Were on our own A quick glance at the field tells me every other dragon is locked in its own battle Tairns tail swings out slamming into the wyverns hindquarters and comes away bloody but the fucking thing doesnt release Deigh Its claws flex burrowing deeper beneath the reds scales Deigh Liams scream is raw his voice breaking at the end Tairn lunges snapping at the wyverns shoulder and drawing blood but its not enough He swings around to get a better angle on the wyvern and the force nearly costs Liam his grip but the buckle holds Another riderless wyvern flies at us from the right On the right Tairn whips his body faster than Ive ever felt and rips out the throat of the new threat shaking the wyvern like a doll then releases his jaws and lets the thing fall hundreds of feet to the mountainside below Then Tairn dives to catch up with Deigh and the wyvern as they race toward the ground Dread settles in my chest ominous and heavy Were on our way Xaden says But hell be too late Violet Liam shouts over the wind and I rip my attention from the gruesome battle alongside us as we spiral downward We have to take out the riders I know I reply We will He just needs to hang on They both do No I mean thats the Tairn lunges again and were thrown sideways as he rips another hole in the wyverns wings with his teeth raking down its tail with his talons but the creature has Deigh in a death lock Its wings are shredded now but it doesnt seem to care as its claws dig into Deighs underbelly like its willing to mindlessly die to make the kill Its going to be all right I promise Liam wind stinging my cheeks It has to be all right even though the ground rushes at us closer and closer each second it justhas to be Deigh screams again the sound weaker and higherpitched than the last Its a cry We have to pull up Tairn warns Hes dying Liam lunges across Tairns back reaching for his dragon as if so he can touch the Red Daggertail one last time Just hold I start but Deighs shriek of pain closes my throat strangling the words Hes being eviscerated and theres nothing we can do The wyvern roars in victory a heartbeat before they crash into the hillside with a sickening thud The wyvern limps away on its hind legs and the talons that tip its wings Deigh doesnt move Liams raw scream shatters my heart and Tairn flares his wings banking hard to keep us from the same gruesome fate DEIGH Tairns grief blasts through my body as he streams fire at the wyverns retreating back and Andarnas cry fills my head No If Deigh Is he I cant bring myself to finish Hes gone Tairn reverses course barreling for the hillside outside the city walls where Deigh has fallen No No No That means Liam I grab for my friend as we land at speed Tairns claws digging into the ground to stop us close to Deighs body You only have minutes Tairn warns Deigh Liam whispers falling limp against Tairns back Ill get you to him I promise already fumbling with the straps buckle Deighs gone I cry to Xaden my voice a trembling mess Liam is dying No I feel his terror his sorrow and his overpowering anger wrap around my mind mixing with my own until it hurts to breathe Minutes We have minutes Just hold on I whisper to Liam fighting not to cry as he looks up at me with those skyblue eyes wide with shock and pain After everything Liam has given up for me this is the least I can do for him I can get him to Deigh the same way I know he would carry me to Tairn or Andarna Tairn lies down completely flattening his massive frame as much as possible as I unstrap my thighs Then I wrap my arms around Liams bulky frame and we slide down Tairns side hitting our feet on the rocky hillside far from the trading post Deigh lies a couple of dozen feet away his body folded at an unnatural angle This isnt fair This isnt right Not Deigh NotLiam Theyre the strongest of our year Theyre the best of us Cant make it Liam says stumbling forward and tripping I rush to catch him as he goes down but his substantial weight is too much for me and we both fall to our knees We can make it I force out through my tightening throat trying to hook his arm over my shoulders Were so close If a venin comes along then Ill deal with it We cant He crumples against me sliding down my side I fall back on my heels and his head lands in my lap as his body goes limp Its all right Violet he says looking up at me and I shove my goggles on top of my head so I can see him clearer Hes struggling to breathe Its not all right I want to scream with the injustice of it but that wont help My hand trembles as I slide his riding goggles up to his forehead then brush his blond hair back off his forehead None of this is all right Please stay I beg tears I cant fight rolling unchecked down my cheeks Fight to stay Please Liam Fight to stay At Parapet His face twists in pain You have to take care of my sister Liam no I choke on the words as tears clog my throat Youll be there I stroke his hair Hes fine Hes physically perfectly fine and yet Im watching him slip away You have to be there He has to smile at the sister hes missed for years and flash that dimple of his He has to give her the stack of letters hes written He deserves it after all hes been through He cant die for me Tairn I cry Tell me what to do Theres nothing you can do Silver One We both know I wont Just promise youll take care of Sloane he begs his eyes searching mine as his breaths grow ragged Promise I promise I whisper taking his hand and squeezing not bothering to wipe my tears Ill take care of Sloane Hes dying and theres nothing I can do Nothing anyone can do How can all this power be so fucking useless The pulse under my thumb slows Good Thats good He forces a weak smile and that dimple makes a faint appearance before his expression falters And I know you feel betrayed but Xaden needs you And I dont just mean alive Violet He needs you Please hear him out All right I nod fighting to force a watery smile He could ask for anything right now and Id give it to him Thank you Liam Thank you for being my shadow Thank you for being my friend He blurs in my vision as the tears come faster Its been My honor Liams chest rattles as his lungs struggle A gust of wind blows the loosened strands of my braid back from my face Seconds later I feel Xaden racing toward us a torrent of his emotions overwhelming my own No Liam Xaden chokes out as he crouches in front of us the muscles in his face working to control his expression but theres no hiding the despair that pushes at our mental connection Deigh Liam pleads in a strangled whisper turning his head toward Xaden I know brother Xadens jaw flexes and our gazes lock above Liam as tears overflow my eyes I know He leans forward and lifts Liam into his arms then stands carrying him Ill take you He walks slowly across the gravelly terrain to Deighs body saying things I cant hear from where I kneel the rocks digging into my knees through the fabric of the leather as I watch Xaden say goodbye Xaden lowers Liam sitting him against Deighs unblemished shoulder then kneels beside him nodding slowly at whatever Liam has said The cry of a wyvern splits the air above us and I look up instinctively A cloud of flapping gray wings moves toward us from higher up the valley Wyvern Dozens and dozens of wyvern Look up at the valley Liams head rolls slowly as they both look Xadens head bows and my breath freezes in my lungs as shadows momentarily whip out around him like a blast of menace and sorrow Seconds later his soundless soulrending scream fills my head with such force that my heart shatters like glass against a stone floor I dont need to ask Liam is gone Liam who never complained about being my shadow never hesitated to help never bragged about being the best of our year He died protecting me Oh gods and I just asked him if wed ever really been friends an hour ago Just one of those beasts managed to kill my friend what the hell can that many accomplish A bloodied wyvern dives for us and Tairn throws his wing over me I hear the sound of his teeth snapping and a sharp cry above me before his wing retracts Were targets on the ground Tairn says as the wyvern flies away Then lets be the ones who hunt I stumble to my feet in time to see Xaden running my way Violence Xaden grasps my shoulders determination lining his features Liam told me to tell you that there are two riders with that horde Why would he tell me and not An anvil sits on my chest Because he knew Id have to be the one who holds off the wyvern as long as possible He studies my face like hell never see it again And Im the one who can kill them all It will kill me to wield that many times but Im the best shot we have The best shot he has to survive You can kill them He yanks me close and kisses my forehead There is no me without you he says against my skin Before I can react he turns toward the valley and lifts his armsthrowing up a wall of shadow that consumes the space between the ridgelines Go Ill give you as much time as I can Every second matters and these are bound to be my lastour last In the span of one heartbeat I look over my shoulder past Tairn and see the flaming ruins of the trading post Townspeople run from the city walls fleeing the wyvern that circle above My stomach drops at our failurewe havent managed to evacuate all the civilians At the second beat I draw a stuttered breath of smokeladen air as a lone gryphon flies through the haze followed by Garrick and Imogen on their dragons and I can only hope the others are still alive In the third heartbeat I turn back toward Liams and Deighs lifeless bodies and rage floods my veins faster than any lightning strike Ive ever wielded The horde of wyvern behind Xadens wall will tear into Tairn and Sgaeyl just like Deigh And Xaden No matter how strong he is Xaden wont be able to hold them forever His arms already shake with the effort of controlling so much power Hell be the first to die if Im not exactly what he called me under that tree all those months ago Violence There are dozens of wyvern and one of me I have to be as strategic as Brennan and as confident as Mira Ive spent the last year trying to prove to myself Im nothing like my mother Im not cold Im not callous But maybe there is a part of me thats more like her than I care to admit Because right now standing near the dead body of my friend and his dragonall I want is to show these assholes exactly how violent I can be I pull my goggles down as I turn to Tairns shoulder mounting quickly Theres no need to ask him to launch not when our emotions are aligned like this We want the same exact thing Revenge I buckle the straps across my thighs as Tairn springs upward taking off with heavy beats of his massive wings The bloodied wyvern has doubled back and Tairn flies straight at it I dont even care if its the same one that just killed our friends Theyre all going to die As soon as we get close enough I throw my hands out letting all my power loose with a guttural scream Lightning hits the wyvern on the first shot sending the monster plummeting to the ground near the city walls But I never see the one coming at us from the left Not until I feel Tairns roar of pain But it was the third brother who commanded the sky to surrender its greatest power who finally vanquished his jealous sibling at a great and terrible price The Origin The Fables of the Barren CHAPTER THIRTYSEVEN I whip around in the saddle and see a veninthe one who killed Soleil distended branchlike veins spreading from her red eyesgrasping the sword shes stabbed in between Tairns scales in the area behind his wings Theres a venin on your back I shout at Tairn as the venin whips a ball of fire toward my head It comes so close that I feel the singe of heat along my cheek Tairn rolls executing a dizzying climb that throws my weight back into the saddle and yet the venin holds fast grabbing on to the embedded sword as her feet fly out from under her The second Tairn levels off the venin stares at me like Im her next meal striding for me with nothing but resolve in her eyes and fisting serrated greentipped daggers Three more riderless ones on my tail Tairn shouts Fuck Theres something Im missing Its taunting me from the edge of my mind like the answer to a test I know Ive studied for Arent you a little small for a dragon rider the venin hisses Big enough to kill you Tairn and I are dead if I dont do something I need you to stay level I tell Tairn unbuckling my thigh straps You will not unseat Tairn growls I wont let her kill you I climb to my feet and unsheathe the two daggers Xaden gave me today Every challenge every obstacle every hour Imogen spent in the weight room every single time Xaden has taken me to the mat has to be worth something right This is just a challengewith a notsofictitious dark wielderon the parapet A moving flying parapet Get back in your seat Tairn orders You cant shake her Shell cut into you again I have to kill her I shove the fear aside Theres no room for it here By the dying sunlight and the eerie glow of the burning city below us I dodge the first swipe of her knife then the second ducking low and throwing up my forearm to block a downward thrust halting the plunge of metal jabbing toward my face The force of impact results in a snap I know is one of my bones Excruciating pain momentarily freezes me as the dagger flies out of my hand Im down to only one My heart pounds as my feet catch on one of Tairns spikes and I stumble I cant even cradle my ruined throbbing arm as she advances gaining on me with every lunge and swipe of her greentipped daggers Its as if she knows exactly what Im going to do before I do it She counters every one of my attacks with a quicker one of her own as if shes adapting to my fighting style from mere moments of combat Shes unnaturally quick Ive never seen Xaden or Imogen move this fast I manage to parry each of her attacks but theres no question that Im on the defense Shes not even in leathers just a fluttering sail of a robe and still Pain flares in my side hot and sharp and I fall back in disbelief when I find one of her daggers protruding low in my side just beneath the edge of the dragonscale armor Tairn roars and Andarna shrieks Violet Xaden screams Shes too fast I doubt the dagger has struck anything vital from its position and I fight through mouthwatering nausea to balance the only venin blade I have left and yank hers out But something isnt right The wound begins to burn and I immediately battle to keep my balance as acid races through my veins The tip on the knife is no longer green as it falls from my fingers Such untapped power No wonder we were called here You could command the sky to surrender all its power and I bet you dont know what to do with it do you Riders never do Im going to split you open and see where all that astonishing lightning comes from She waves the other dagger at me and I realize shes playing with me Or maybe Ill let him do it Youll wish for death if I hand you over to my Sage She has a teacher Shes a damn student just like me and Im lethally outmatched I can barely keep track of which hand her blade is in My arm has its own heartbeat and my side screams Level the playing field Xaden orders Hes split his power and shadows rush in from the cliffs at my left throwing the world around meand the venininto a cloud of complete darkness And I have the power of light Im the one in control now and I know the terrain of Tairns back like my own hand Moving to the right where I can feel the slope of his shoulder I take up a fighting stance grip my dagger in my good hand and let my power explode through the dark illuminating the sky for one crackling priceless second The venin is disoriented her back turned toward me I plunge the runed dagger between her ribsright where Xaden showed me all those months agoand yank it out so I dont lose it She staggers backward her face turning an ashen gray before she falls from Tairns back I falter swaying as the acid in my veins burns brighter harsher incinerating me from the inside out Shes dead I manage to tell them throwing the word out toward Tairn Xaden Andarna Sgaeylwhoever might be listening The shadows fall away letting in the fading light of dusk as I stumble toward the saddle holding my side to stanch the flow of blood from the stab wound Youre hurt Tairn accuses Im fine I lie staring with wide eyes as darkblack blood sludges through my fingers Not good So not good I wont be able to fight another in handtohand not with the wound in my side and soon Ill be too weak to wield The strength is flowing out of me with my blood I sheathe the dagger My best weapon now is my mind Taking a deep breath I fight to steady my heartbeat and think Theyre falling Tairn says and I jerk my gaze from my side to see three wyvern tumble from the sky and crash to the earth Riderless wyvern Created by venin And they all died because I killed one venin Thats what Liam was trying to tell me When a dragon dies so does its rider But apparently when a venin dies so do the wyvern they created All of them Thats how we can save everyone on this battlefield There are two riders among the horde Xaden is holding back We have to take out the riders I whisper Yes Tairn agrees following my thoughts Excellent idea Youre willing to gamble your life on it If Im wrong were both dead and so are Xaden and Sgaeyl I will bet my life on you as I have from the first day he says banking to fly back to the valley as the other dragons rush with their riders to follow us no doubt following Tairns command Only Garrick and his Brown Scorpiontail are ahead of us flying low and fast toward Xaden Three of the venin are dead but one is I watch in horror as a venin with a staff as tall as he is strides out of the darkness his menacing gaze locked on Xaden To the left I scream at Xaden Sgaeyl spins and blasts fire at the venin but he doesnt so much as pause Garrick leans from his seat and flings a dagger but before it can reach the venin the robed figure slams his staff into the ground and disappears like he was never there in the first place He moved But to where The hell I shout into the wind A general can recognize another general and thats their leader Tairn says The Sage I cant hold them back much longer Xaden yells his arms shaking so hard it looks like his body is tearing itself apart at the very seams as we rush toward the mouth of the valley New plan I tell Xaden as Tairn pushes himself to the max I need you to let the shadows fall WHAT Hes already wavering I can see it by the straining shapes against his shadows wyvern desperate to push their way through So much suffering The hurt in Andarnas voice jars me I whip my head back toward the trading post and catch the glint of gold My heart seizes No Its not safe for you here You need me she yells Please hide One of us has to survive this I tell her as Tairn flies past Xaden and Sgaeyl Xaden you have to drop the shadows Its the only way Tairn Sgaeyl shouts fear edging her tone in a way Ive never heard Dont ask that of me Even Xadens voice shakes Those shadows are coming down whether or not he wants them to Hes approaching burnout If youve ever trusted me Xaden I need you to do it now I use his earlier words barely breathing through the searing pain in my side Hell lose himself to burnout if he doesnt trust me Fuck In a blink the wall of shadow falls and the wyvern fly toward us with terrifying speed If I cant do this no one will survive There are too many of them Spot the more powerful rider Tairn Its the best bet The only bet Were a minute away from a collision Once Ive taken the rider out that only leaves one Xaden Just kill that one and the rest of the wyvern will fall Im coming But Ill get there first Tairn is faster than Sgaeyl You saved us by holding them back this long When he starts to respond I slam my shield down blocking him out to concentrate Tairns head swivels left and right searching and I break apart the last of my Archives walls keeping one foot firmly on that marble floor There Tairn says his head turned to the right That one At the corner of the flying horde is a seated venin crimson veins streaking his temples and traveling down his cheeks Youre sure I ask Positive Blue fire erupts from the horde and I barely draw breath before a torrent of shadows rises from the edges of the valley snuffing out the flame Power ripples in my bones vibrating my very being with the amount of energy Im forcing my body to contain Tell me your plan isnt to try and jump on the wyverns back Tairn asks as my breath hitches Just a few more seconds and well be close enough I dont have to I tell him Didnt you hear what the venin said I can command the sky to surrender all its power but Im going to need every ounce of yours to do it I unleash my signet and strike once missing the wyvern then again missing once more Theyre almost on us as I strike again and again pushing myself to the limit as Xaden smothers the blue flames before they have a chance to burn me alive I cant aim Im not ready Maybe if I had another year or two to practice but not now I need more Tairn You will burn out Silver One he growls dodging a flame Xaden misses You already walk the edge My arms shake as I lift them again This is the only way I can save them I can save Sgaeyl You just have to decide to live Tairn Even if I dont I will not watch another rider die because they do not know their own limitations One more strike could be your last I feel your waning strength I know exactly what Im capable of I promise as energy fills my body once again and my heart jolts struggling to find the right rhythm Hot Im so damned hot I feel like I could burst into flame myself Ive taken too much power Im not Naolin Fear threatens to consume me as the venin rides at us close enough that I can see his snarling mouth but its not my terror Its Tairns Let me help Andarna shouts and my heart swells even as it stutters from the energy flowing through my veins I dont have time to look to see where she isI only hope shes still in the outpost Only what I need I say to her I swallow hard my good hand clutching the bloodtipped dagger as we fly toward the wall of wyvern I reach for her golden power and it spreads down my spine and explodes through me time pausing around us Tairn flares his wing bringing us to a hover as the wyvern move toward us inch by precious inch fighting against Andarnas magic with their own I have to want to kill that venin and gods help me I do Now I push my arms toward the venin and command lightning to split the sky and it does branching out in every direction but I only need to control one of its silverblue veins I focus on the one closest to the venin bringing it down in slow bursts that defy time My arms vibrate and I feel Tairns power push the boundaries of my body as I yank the branch sideways in its descent inch by inch with the last of my strength positioning it over the venin More Tairn He roars and lightning itself rips through me sizzling my lungs and charring my very breath as Andarnas gift ebbs I dont have to be near her to feel her fatigue her strength ebbing But I only take what I need Andarna will live today even if she is the only one I have only a few heartbeats or this much power will burn through me and take me under Xaden screams through the barrier in my mind and the sounds of his anguish and fear are nearly more than I can bear But theres no time to focus on him to wonder what will happen if I dont succeed Because right now I am focused on vengeance with a coldness that would make even my mother proud Finally dragging the lightning down into place as my skin sizzles and burns I release time and hold myself upright long enough to see it strike true killing the venin at the first touch of its energy As if time were still frozen his body slowly topples from the top of his wyvern In the next breath more than half the monsters fall from the sky as if they were struck themselves and as if it had been waiting for me to accomplish my goal the wound in my side threatens to burn me alive On the left Tairn roars swinging toward the wyvern and its rider as they barrel toward us with murder in their eyes A rope of shadow flies up wrapping around the venins neck as Tairn banks left to avoid the hit and I barely manage to keep my seat Xaden pulls the venin from the wyverns back and yanks him downward right into the dagger he holds in his outstretched hand Damn sometimes I forget just how beautifully lethal he is Knowing theyll all live I let gravity claim my body and slide from Tairns back VIOLET I hear Xadens scream as I fall In the event that you come across a poison you do not recognize it is best to treat with any and every antidote Either way the patient will die but at least this way you would have learned something Major Fredericks Modern Guide for Healers CHAPTER THIRTYEIGHT I think I might die today Air rushes by and my stomach feels like its somewhere above me Because Im falling Endlessly falling Tairn roars and its the panic the pitch of that bellow that forces my eyes open just long enough to see him diving for me but I cant feel him in my head cant feel my feet on the Archives floor cant access my power Im cut off no longer grounded My back slams into something knocking the breath from my lungs slowing my descent but not stopping it and shimmering gold rises and ebbs around me Wind stills the cries of mayhem and destruction pause but the burn inside rages on consuming me with fiery teeth Time Andarna has stopped time with what strength she has left Im on her back fallingbecause she isnt strong enough to carry me but shes brave enough to fly into this battle Now my eyes are burning too She shouldnt be here She should be tucked away in the outpost safe from the wyvern three times her size Are there any wyvern left Did we get them all When time starts again wind whipping at my exposed skin I slip from her back and am gathered close by strong human arms Violet I know that deep panicked voice Xaden But I cant move cant even force my lips apart to scream with the pain of it all when he puts pressure on the wound Fuck it must be poison You have to fight it Poison The greentipped dagger But what poison could paralyze me not only physically but magically Ill take care of you Justjust live Please live Of course he wants me to live Im integral to his survival It takes all my strength but I manage to lift my eyelids for a second and the blatant fear in his eyes jolts my heart before I lose consciousness Maybe it isnt poison someone says in a deep voice as I wake but cant pry my eyes open Garrick maybe Gods everything hurts Maybe its magic Did you see the way she whipped that lightning straight at that venins head someone asks Not now Bodhi practically growls She saved your fucking life She saved all our lives But I didnt Soleil andLiam are dead Her blood is fucking black Xaden snaps and his arms tighten holding me to his chest It has to be poison Imogen criesa sound Ive never heard from her Look at it We have to get her back to Basgiath Nolon might be able to help Yes Nolon They need to take me to Nolon But I cant say it cant make my lips move cant even reach out along the mental pathways that have become as familiar to me as breathing Being cut off from Tairn from Andarnafrom Xaden is a torture all on its own Thats a twelvehour flight Xadens voice rises And Im pretty sure her arm is broken Ill be dead in twelve hours The promise of sweet oblivion already hovers at the edge of my consciousness a promise of peace if I agree to just let go Theres somewhere closer Xaden says quietly and I feel his fingers skim over my cheek The motion is unnervingly tender Another wave of fire consumes me singeing every nerve but all I can do is lie there and take it Make it stop Gods make it stop You cant be serious Someones voice lowers to a hiss Youll put everything at risk Garrick warns as sleep tugs at me the only escape from the searing pain Tairn bellows so loudly my rib cage vibrates At least hes close I wouldnt say that again Imogen mutters or hell probably eat you And dont forget if she dies theres a damn good chance Xaden does too Im not saying he shouldnt just reminding him what the stakes are Garrick replies Can Tairn feel the disconnect between us Is he suffering the same way I am Was the sword poisoned too Can Andarna fly Or does she need to sleep Sleep Thats what I want Cool blissful empty sleep I dont give a fuck what happens to me Xaden yells at someone We are going and thats an order No need for orders man Well save her Thats Bodhi I think Live up to your nickname and fight this Violence Xaden whispers against my ear Then he says louder to someone farther away We have to get her to him We ride I feel the shift as he begins to walk but the agony of movement against the wound is too much and I fade into blackness Hours pass before I wake again Maybe seconds Maybe days Maybe its forever and Ive been sentenced to an eternity of torture by Malek for my sheer recklessness but I cant bring myself to regret saving them Maybe its better if I die But then Xaden might die Whatever is wedged between us right now I dont want him dead Ill never want that A steady rush of wind at my face and the rhythmic beat of wings tells me were flying and it takes all the energy I have to lift a single eyelid as we pass over the Cliffs of Dralor The thousandfoot drop is unmistakable Its what made the Tyrrish rebellion not only possible but nearly successful The poison scorches every vein every nerve ending in my body as it runs through me unchecked slowing my heartbeat Even the irony that Im going to die by poison something I have unparalleled knowledge of cant make me muster the energy to speak to offer any thoughts on an antidote How can I when I dont even know whats been used on me Until a few hours ago I didnt even know venin existed outside fables and now theres nothing but pain and death Its only a matter of time and mine is short Death would be preferable to existing for another second in this pyre of a body but its apparently a mercy Im not allowed as Im jostled awake Air Theres not enough air My lungs struggle to inhale Youre sure about this Imogen asks Each step Xaden takes brings a new wave of agony that starts in my side and ripples through my whole body Stop fucking asking him that Garrick snaps He made his decision Support him or get the fuck out Imogen And its a bad one another man retorts When you have a hundred and seven scars on your back then you get to make the fucking decisions Ciaran Bodhi snarls Tairns roar startles me and I twitch which only intensifies the already indescribable torture racking my body now What was that Garrick asks from somewhere to the left He basically said that hell cook me alive if I fail Xaden replies holding me closer I guess that part of the bond is still in place My cheek falls against his shoulder and I swear I feel him brush a kiss over my forehead but that cant be right You dont keep secrets from someone you care about let alone secrets that are going to cost me my life any second if the stuttering beat of my heart is any indication Its struggling to pump the liquid fire thats cauterizing my veins Gods I wish hed just let me die I deserve it Im the reason Liam is dead Im so weakminded that I didnt even realize Dain took my memories and used them against meagainst Liam You have to fight Vi Xaden whispers against my forehead as we move You can hate me all you want when you wake up You can scream hit throw your fucking daggers at me for all I care but you have to live You cant make me fall for you and then die None of this is worth it without you He sounds so sincere that I almost believe him Which is exactly what got me into this situation in the first place Xaden a familiar voice calls out but I cant place it Bodhi maybe One of the second years So many strangers And no friends Liam is dead You have to save her Youre all cowards The last words of Fen Riorson redacted CHAPTER THIRTYNINE XADEN Shell be all right Sgaeyls voice is gentler than shes ever deigned to use with me Then again she didnt choose me because I needed coddling She chose me for the scars on my back and the simple fact that I am the grandson of her second riderthe one who didnt make it through the quadrant You dont know that shell be all right No one does Its been three fucking days and Violet hasnt woken up Three neverending days Ive spent in this armchair walking a knifes edge between sanity and madness studying every rise and fall of her chest just to be sure shes still breathing My lungs only fill when hers do and the time between my heartbeats is filled with sharp allconsuming fear Shes never looked fragile to me but she does now lying in the middle of my bed her lips pale and chapped the ends of her hair duller than their usual bladelike hue For three days everything about her has felt as though the life was leached from her body only a shadow of her soul left beneath her skin But today at least the morning light shows her cheeks have a little more color along the darker line of her flight goggles than yesterday Im a fucking fool I should have left her at Basgiath Or sent her with Aetos even if it strained Sgaeyl and Tairn She never should have suffered the punishment Colonel Aetos delivered For a crime she didnt even know I was committing Didnt even suspect I run a hand through my hair She wasnt the only one who suffered Liam would be alive Liam Guilt pairs with soulsucking grief and I can barely inhale around the pain in my chest Id ordered my foster brother to keep her safe and that order got him killed His death is on me I should have known what was waiting for us at Athebyne You should have told her about the venin I waited for you to impart the information and now shes suffering Tairn growls The dragon is the living firebreathing embodiment of my shame But at least the bond that links the four of us is still in place even if he cant communicate with herwhich means Violets alive He can yell at me all he wants as long as her hearts beating I should have done a lot of things differently What I shouldnt have done was fought my feelings for her I should have grabbed on to her after that first kiss the way I wanted and kept her at my side should have let her all the way in My eyelids scratch like sandpaper each time I blink but Im fighting sleep with every bone in my body Sleep is where I hear her heartbreaking scream hear her cry that Liam died hear her call me a fucking traitor over and over She cant die and not just because theres a chance I wont survive She cant die because I know I cant live without her even if I do Somewhere between the shock of our attraction at the top of that turret to realizing she risked her own life by giving up a boot for someone else on the parapet that first day to her throwing those daggers at my head under the oak tree I wavered I should have realized the danger of getting too close the first time I put her on her back and showed her how easily she could kill me on the mata vulnerability Ive allowed no one elsebut I brushed it off as an undeniable attraction to a uniquely beautiful woman When I watched her conquer the Gauntlet then defend Andarna at Threshing I stumbled stunned by both her cunning and her sense of honor When I burst into her room and found Orens treacherous hand at her throat the rage that made it so easy to kill all six of them without batting an eye should have told me I was headed for a cliff And when she smiled at me after mastering her shield in mere minutes her face lighting up as the snow fell around us I fucking fell We hadnt even kissed and I fell Or maybe it was when she threw her knives at Barlowe or when jealousy ate me alive seeing Aetos kiss the mouth Id dreamed about countless times Looking back there were a thousand tiny moments that pulled me over the edge for the woman asleep in the bed I always pictured her in And I never told her Not until she was delirious with poison Why Because I was scared to give her power over me when she already held it all Because shes Lilith Sorrengails daughter Because she kept giving Aetos second and third chances No Because I couldnt give her those words without being totally completely honest with her and after the way she looked at me at the lake the utter betrayal The rustle of sheets makes my gaze whip to her face and I take my first full breath since she fell from Tairns back Her eyes are open Youre awake My voice sounds like its been dragged across gravel when I thought itd only been my heart I stagger to my feet and take the two steps that separate me from her bedside Shes awake Shes alive Shessmiling That must be a trick of the light This woman likely wants to set me on fire Can I check your side The mattress depresses slightly as I sit near her hip She nods and stretches her arms up like a cat whos been napping in the sun before reaching for the blankets Drawing back the covers I untie the robe covering the short nightdress I changed her into that first evening and slowly lift the hem above the silken skin of her hip preparing myself for the black tendrils that discolored her veins during the flight but receded slowly since we arrived Theres nothing Just a thin silver line an inch above her hipbone Air gushes from my lungs in relief Miraculous Whats miraculous she croaks looking down at her new scar Shit I would be a horrible healer Water My hand shakes with exhaustion or relief I dont even care which as I pour a glass from the pitcher on my bedside table You must be parched She pushes herself to sit then takes the glass drinking the entire thing down Thanks You are I set the empty glass on the nightstand and then turn back to her gazing into the hazel eyes that have haunted me since Parapet You are miraculous I finish in a whisper I was fucking terrified Violet There arent adequate words Im fine Xaden she says softly her hand rising to rest above my pounding heart I thought I was going to lose you The confession comes out strangled and maybe its pushing my luck after all Ive put her through but I cant keep from leaning forward and brushing my lips over her forehead then her temple Gods Id kiss her forever if I thought it would keep the coming argument at bay keep us in this one pristine moment where I can actually believe that everything might be all right between us that I havent irrevocably fucked up the best thing thats ever happened to me You arent going to lose me She gives me a puzzled look smiling like Ive said something peculiar Then she leans in and kisses me She still wants me The revelation makes my heart fucking soar I take the kiss deeper swiping my tongue over her soft lower lip and gently sucking on the tender curve Thats all it takes for need to flood my system hot and demanding Its always like this between usthe slightest spark sets off a wildfire that consumes every thought that isnt related to how many ways I can make her moan Well have a lifetime of these moments ahead of us when I can strip her down to her skin and worship every curve and hollow of her body but this isnt one of them not when shes barely been awake for five minutes I draw back slowly releasing her mouth Ill make it up to you I promise holding her delicate hands between my rough ones Im not saying we wont fight or you wont want to throw those daggers at me when Im inevitably an ass but I swear I will always strive to do better Make what up to me She pulls away with an inquisitive smile I blink as my brow furrows Has she lost her memories How much do you remember By the time we got you here the poison spread to your brain and Her eyes flare and something shifts something that sinks my stomach like a rock as she tugs her hands from mine She glances away and her eyes glaze in that way that tells me shes checking in with her dragons Dont panic Everything is fine Andarna isnt quite the same but shesher Shes fucking huge now but Im not about to say that to Violet Her gift is also gone according to Tairn but theres plenty of time to share that news Instead I say The healer told me he isnt sure what lasting effects the poison might have because it was something hes never seen and no one really knows how long it will take to get your memories back if theres any lasting damage but Ill tell you She throws up her hand and looks around the room as if noticing where we are for the first time then scrambles backward out of bed pulling her robe closed The look in her eyes puts a vise around my chest as she stumbles to the large windows that line my bedchamber The windows that look out over the mountain this fortress is built upon down to the valley below and its line of charred trees marking where the earth was scorched all the way to stone and the quiet townwhich used to be a cityof Aretia beneath us The town weve worked our asses off to rebuild from a pile of cinder and ruins Violet I keep my shields up trying to respect her privacy as I walk to her side but gods I need to know what shes thinking Her eyes widen as her gaze sweeps over the town each structure with its identical green roofs then pauses on the Temple of Amari which was the most noted landmark besides our library Where are we And dont you dare lie to me she says Not again Not again You remember I remember Thank gods I murmur shoving my hand into my hair Its a good thing proving that shes truly healed butfuck Where Are We She bites out every word her eyes narrowing on me Say it The way youre looking at me says you already know Theres no way this brilliant woman doesnt recognize that temple This looks like Aretia She gestures to the window Theres only one temple with those particular columns Ive seen the drawings Yes Brilliant Fucking Woman Aretia was burned to the ground Ive seen those drawings too the ones the scribes brought back for the public notices My mother told me she saw the embers with her own eyes so where are we Her voice rises Aretia It feels incredibly freeing to tell her the truth Rebuilt or never burned She turns her back on me In the process of rebuilding Why havent I read about this I start to tell her but she holds up a hand and I wait It only takes her a minute to work it out too She points to my rebellion relic and says Melgren cant see the outcome when more than three of you are together Thats why youre not allowed to assemble I cant help it I smile This brilliant fucking woman is mine Or was mine Will be mine again if I have anything to say about it Which I probably dont I sigh losing the smile immediately Fuck No Im not giving up until she tells me to Things might be complicated but so are both of us That and were not big enough to warrant the attention of the scribes anymore Were not hidden Were just notadvertising our existence Which is also the reason this place is still technicallymine Nobles werent exactly eager to throw their money at a scorched city or be taxed on unusable land Eventually theyll notice Eventually Ill lose it Then Ill lose my head You can know whatever you want Just ask She stiffens Tell me one thing right now Anything Is Her shoulders stutter as she inhales Is Liam really dead Liam A fresh stab of sorrow pierces my ribs Heartbeats pass in silence as I try to find the right words but there arent any so I take from my pocket the palmsize freshly finished carving of Andarna Liam had been working on She turns in my direction her gaze immediately locking on the figurine and her eyes water Its my fault No its mine If I had just told you everything sooner you would have been prepared You probably would have schooled us all on how to kill them My soul breaks all over again when she swipes at twin tears with the backs of her hands I set the carving in her hand I know I should have but I couldnt bear to burn it We laid him to rest yesterday Well the others did I havent left this room since we got here Our gazes collide and its all I can do not to reach for her but I know Im the last place shell seek comfort I havent left you Well you do have a vested interest in my survival she quips with a watery sarcastic smile Give me a second to get dressed and then well talk Kicking me out of my own room I reach for that sarcastic teasing tone that used to be so easy when it came to her and back away New one Now Riorson I cant keep from wincing She never uses my last name Maybe its because she doesnt like to remember that Im Fen Riorsons son and all my father cost her but Ive always been Xaden to her The loss feels like a bottomless abyss like a death blow Bathing chamber is through there I point to the far wall and stride for the exit swinging my sword over my back on the way out My cousin is leaned up against the wall talking to Garrick whos boasting a new sixinch scar from temple to jaw but they both fall silent as I shut my door behind me They tense and Garrick stands to his full height Shes awake Thank Amari Bodhi says his shoulders sagging His arm is still in a sling recovering from the four places a venin fractured it Shes going to have to choose I look at Garrick noting the worry in his eyes Hes already told me he thinks shell keep our secret That worry is for my mental state if she doesnt forgive me for not telling her sooner Shell either keep our secret or she wont Thats something youll have to figure out he replies And then teach her how to hide it from Aetos if she chooses Any word from the fliers Syrena is alive if thats what youre asking Bodhi answers So is her sister But the rest He shakes his head At least they made it out and now that Violet is awake I can finally breathe You figure out what that box was that Chradh was drawn to back at Resson I ask Garricks dragon is remarkably sensitive to runes which allowed them to locate and retrieve the small iron box beneath the rubble of the clock tower Theyre working on it right now Hopefully well have an answer in the next couple of hours Im glad shes all right Xaden Ill tell the others He nods once and heads down the hall almost as familiar with the castles layout as I am considering he spent every summer here before the apostasy or secession as the Navarrians call Dads rebellion Funny how people rename everything that makes them feel uncomfortable We lost faith that our king would ever do the right thing And they call us traitors Bodhi wrinkles his nose What You smell like dragon ass Fuck off I chance a whiff and cant argue Im using your room I would consider it a personal favor I extend my middle finger and head toward his room An hour later Im bathed and impatient as I wait outside my room in a fresh set of leathers with Bodhi whos doing his best to lighten my mood just like he always does when the door opens and Violet stands there I nearly swallow my tongue at the sight of her unbound damp hair curling just under her breasts I cant even articulate what it is about the strands that pushes me straight into needtofuckhernow territory and Im too busy fighting to keep my hands at my sides to question the why of it She exists and I get turned on Ive come to accept that particular truth over the last year Bodhi grins flashing a smile that looks exactly like my aunts used to Good to see you up and about Sorrengail Then he smacks me on the shoulder as he walks off looking back over his shoulder Ill fetch the backup plan Good luck Gods I want to haul her into my arms and love her until she forgets everything except how good we are together but Im sure thats the last thing shell ever want again Come back in she says softly and my heart lurches As long as youve invited me I walk in loathing the distrust in her eyes Whether or not Violet will believe me Ive never lied to her Not once Ive just never been entirely truthful either Is all this original she asks her gaze sweeping over my bedroom The majority of the fortress is stone I say as she studies the detailed arches at the ceiling the natural lighting from the windows that consume the western wall Stone doesnt burn Right I swallow Hard I think after all youve seen the question I have to ask before I tell you everything is pretty simple Are you in Are you willing to fight with us She could just as easily decide to turn us all in She didnt know enough to condemn us but she does now Im in She nods Relief surges through me in a rush more powerful than anything I could channel from Sgaeyl and I reach for her Im so sorry I had to keep My words die on my tongue as she steps back avoiding me Not happening A world of hurt flashes in those hazel eyes and I fucking wither Just because I believe you and am willing to fight with you doesnt mean Ill trust you with my heart again And I cant be with someone I dont trust Something in my chest crumples Ive never lied to you Violet Not once I never will She walks over to the window and looks down then slowly turns back to me Its not even that you kept this from me I get it Its the ease with which you did it The ease with which I let you into my heart and didnt get the same in return She shakes her head and I see it there the love but its masked behind defenses I foolishly forced her to build I love her Of course I love her But if I tell her now shell think Im saying it for all the wrong reasons and honestly shed be right Im not going to lose the only woman Ive ever fallen for without a fight Youre right I kept secrets I admit pressing forward again taking step after step until Im less than a foot from her I palm the glass on both sides of her head loosely caging her in but we both know she could walk away if she wanted But she doesnt move It took me a long time to trust you a long time to realize I fell for you Someone knocks I ignore it Dont say that She lifts her chin but I dont miss the way she glances at my mouth I fell for you I lower my head and look straight into her gorgeous eyes She might be rightfully pissed but she sure as Malek isnt fickle And you know what You might not trust me anymore but you still love me Her lips part but she doesnt deny it I gave you my trust for free once and once is all you get She masks the hurt with a quick blink Never again Those eyes will never reflect hurt Ive inflicted ever again I fucked up by not telling you sooner and I wont even try to justify my reasons But now Im trusting you with my lifewith everyones lives Ive risked it all by just bringing her here instead of taking her body back to Basgiath Ill tell you anything you want to know and everything you dont Ill spend every single day of my life earning back your trust Id forgotten what it felt like to be loved really truly loveditd been so many years since Dad died And Mom Not going there But then Violet gave me those words gave me her trust her heart and I remembered Ill be damned if I dont fight to keep them And if its not possible You still love me Its possible Gods do I ache to kiss her to remind her exactly what we are together but I wont not until she asks Im not afraid of hard work especially not when I know just how sweet the rewards are I would rather lose this entire war than live without you and if that means I have to prove myself over and over then Ill do it You gave me your heart and Im keeping it She already owns mine even if she doesnt realize it Her eyes widen as if shes finally seeing the resolve in mine Its time she knew everything Knowing Violet she wont stay tucked away safe behind Basgiaths walls especially not now that she knows just how corrupt those walls are Shell fight this war at my side Theres another insistent knock at the door Fuck is he impatient I mutter You have about twenty seconds to ask a question if I know him She blinks Im still hoping that missive at Athebyne was really about the War Games Do you think theres any chance we just happened to end up in the middle of a wyvern attack at that outpost That definitely wasnt an accident little sister he says from the doorway I sigh and move to the side watching Violets eyes widen as she sees him standing in the doorway Told you I knew better poison masters I tell her softly You werent healed You were mended Brennan She stares at her brother in openmouthed shock Brennan just grins and opens his arms Welcome to the revolution Violet The love
