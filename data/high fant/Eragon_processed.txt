SHADE OFFEAR Wind howled through the night carrying a scent that would change the world A tall Shade lifted his head and sniffed the air He looked human except for his crimson hair and maroon eyes He blinked in surprise The message had been correct they were here Or was it a trap He weighed the odds then said icily Spread out hide behind trees and bushes Stop whoever is coming or die Around him shuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with black symbols They resembled men with bowed legs and thick brutish arms made for crushing A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears The monsters hurried into the brush grunting as they hid Soon the rustling quieted and the forest was silent again The Shade peered around a thick tree and looked up the trail It was too dark for any human to see but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the trees every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze He remained unnaturally quiet a long pale sword in his hand A wirethin scratch curved down the blade The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs yet stout enough to hack through the hardest armor The Urgals could not see as well as the Shade they groped like blind beggars fumbling with their weapons An owl screeched cutting through the silence No one relaxed until the bird flew past Then the monsters shivered in the cold night one snapped a twig with his heavy boot The Shade hissed in anger and the Urgals shrank back motionless He suppressed his distastethey smelled like fetid meatand turned away They were tools nothing more The Shade forced back his impatience as the minutes became hours The scent must have wafted far ahead of its owners He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves He denied himself those luxuries too and stayed behind the tree watching the trail Another gust of wind rushed through the forest The smell was stronger this time Excited he lifted a thin lip in a snarl Get ready he whispered his whole body vibrating The tip of his sword moved in small circles It had taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment It would not do to lose control now Eyes brightened under the Urgals thick brows and the creatures gripped their weapons tighter Ahead of them the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone Faint smudges emerged from the darkness and advanced down the trail Three white horses with riders cantered toward the ambush their heads held high and proud their coats rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver On the first horse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows His build was slim but strong like a rapier A powerful bow was slung on his back A sword pressed against his side opposite a quiver of arrows fletched with swan feathers The last rider had the same fair face and angled features as the other He carried a long spear in his right hand and a white dagger at his belt A helm of extraordinary craftsmanship wrought with amber and gold rested on his head Between these two rode a ravenhaired elven lady who surveyed her surroundings with poise Framed by long black locks her deep eyes shone with a driving force Her clothes were unadorned yet her beauty was undiminished At her side was a sword and on her back a long bow with a quiver She carried in her lap a pouch that she frequently looked at as if to reassure herself that it was still there One of the elves spoke quietly but the Shade could not hear what was said The lady answered with obvious authority and her guards switched places The one wearing the helm took the lead shifting his spear to a readier grip They passed the Shades hiding place and the first few Urgals without suspicion The Shade was already savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward the elves heavy with the Urgals stench The horses snorted with alarm and tossed their heads The riders stiffened eyes flashing from side to side then wheeled their mounts around and galloped away The ladys horse surged forward leaving her guards far behind Forsaking their hiding the Urgals stood and released a stream of black arrows The Shade jumped out from behind the tree raised his right hand and shouted Garjzla A red bolt flashed from his palm toward the elven lady illuminating the trees with a bloody light It struck her steed and the horse toppled with a highpitched squeal plowing into the ground chestfirst She leapt off the animal with inhuman speed landed lightly then glanced back for her guards The Urgals deadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves They fell from the noble horses blood pooling in the dirt As the Urgals rushed to the slain elves the Shade screamed After her She is the one I want The monsters grunted and rushed down the trail A cry tore from the elfs lips as she saw her dead companions She took a step toward them then cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest While the Urgals crashed through the trees the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted above them From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest He raised his hand and uttered Böetq istalri and a quartermile section of the forest exploded into flames Grimly he burned one section after another until there was a ring of fire a halfleague across around the ambush site The flames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest Satisfied he watched the ring carefully in case it should falter The band of fire thickened contracting the area the Urgals had to search Suddenly the Shade heard shouts and a coarse scream Through the trees he saw three of his charges fall in a pile mortally wounded He caught a glimpse of the elf running from the remaining Urgals She fled toward the craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed The Shade examined the ground twenty feet below then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her She skidded around and sped back to the trail Black Urgal blood dripped from her sword staining the pouch in her hand The horned monsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in blocking the only escape routes Her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out Seeing none she drew herself up with regal disdain The Shade approached her with a raised hand allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness Get her As the Urgals surged forward the elf pulled open the pouch reached into it and then let it drop to the ground In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the angry light of the fires She raised it over her head lips forming frantic words Desperate the Shade barked Garjzla A ball of red flame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf fast as an arrow But he was too late A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest and the stone vanished Then the red fire smote her and she collapsed The Shade howled in rage and stalked forward flinging his sword at a tree It passed halfway through the trunk where it stuck quivering He shot nine bolts of energy from his palmwhich killed the Urgals instantlythen ripped his sword free and strode to the elf Prophecies of revenge spoken in a wretched language only he knew rolled from his tongue He clenched his thin hands and glared at the sky The cold stars stared back unwinking otherworldly watchers Disgust curled his lip before he turned back to the unconscious elf Her beauty which would have entranced any mortal man held no charm for him He confirmed that the stone was gone then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among the trees After tying the elf onto the saddle he mounted the charger and made his way out of the woods He quenched the fires in his path but left the rest to burn DISCOVERY Eragon knelt in a bed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye The prints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a halfhour before Soon they would bed down His target a small doe with a pronounced limp in her left forefoot was still with the herd He was amazed she had made it so far without a wolf or bear catching her The sky was clear and dark and a slight breeze stirred the air A silvery cloud drifted over the mountains that surrounded him its edges glowing with ruddy light cast from the harvest moon cradled between two peaks Streams flowed down the mountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks A brooding mist crept along the valleys floor almost thick enough to obscure his feet Eragon was fifteen less than a year from manhood Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown eyes His clothes were worn from work A hunting knife with a bone handle was sheathed at his belt and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist He carried a woodframe pack The deer had led him deep into the Spine a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down the land of Alagaësia Strange tales and men often came from those mountains usually boding ill Despite that Eragon did not fear the Spinehe was the only hunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses It was the third night of the hunt and his food was half gone If he did not fell the doe he would be forced to return home emptyhanded His family needed the meat for the rapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall Eragon stood with quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight then strode into the forest toward a glen where he was sure the deer would rest The trees blocked the sky from view and cast feathery shadows on the ground He looked at the tracks only occasionally he knew the way At the glen he strung his bow with a sure touch then drew three arrows and nocked one holding the others in his left hand The moonlight revealed twenty or so motionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass The doe he wanted was at the edge of the herd her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly Eragon slowly crept closer keeping the bow ready All his work of the past three days had led to this moment He took a last steadying breath andan explosion shattered the night The herd bolted Eragon lunged forward racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his cheek He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe It missed by a fingers breadth and hissed into darkness He cursed and spun around instinctively nocking another arrow Behind him where the deer had been smoldered a large circle of grass and trees Many of the pines stood bare of their needles The grass outside the charring was flattened A wisp of smoke curled in the air carrying a burnt smell In the center of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone Mist snaked across the scorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone Eragon watched for danger for several long minutes but the only thing that moved was the mist Cautiously he released the tension from his bow and moved forward Moonlight cast him in pale shadow as he stopped before the stone He nudged it with an arrow then jumped back Nothing happened so he warily picked it up Nature had never polished a stone as smooth as this one Its flawless surface was dark blue except for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it The stone was cool and frictionless under his fingers like hardened silk Oval and about a foot long it weighed several pounds though it felt lighter than it should have Eragon found the stone both beautiful and frighteningWhere did it come from Does it have a purpose Then a more disturbing thought came to himWas it sent here by accident or am I meant to have it If he had learned anything from the old stories it was to treat magic and those who used it with great caution But what should I do with the stoneIt would be tiresome to carry and there was a chance it was dangerous It might be better to leave it behind A flicker of indecision ran through him and he almost dropped it but something stayed his handAt the very least it might pay for some food he decided with a shrug tucking the stone into his pack The glen was too exposed to make a safe camp so he slipped back into the forest and spread his bedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree After a cold dinner of bread and cheese he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep pondering what had occurred P ALANCARVALLEY The sun rose the next morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow The air was fresh sweet and very cold Ice edged the streams and small pools were completely frozen over After a breakfast of porridge Eragon returned to the glen and examined the charred area The morning light revealed no new details so he started for home The rough game trail was faintly worn and in places nonexistent Because it had been forged by animals it often backtracked and took long detours Yet for all its flaws it was still the fastest way out of the mountains The Spine was one of the only places that King Galbatorix could not call his own Stories were still told about how half his army disappeared after marching into its ancient forest A cloud of misfortune and bad luck seemed to hang over it Though the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly few people could stay in the Spine for long without suffering an accident Eragon was one of those fewnot through any particular gift it seemed to him but because of persistent vigilance and sharp reflexes He had hiked in the mountains for years yet he was still wary of them Every time he thought they had surrendered their secrets something happened to upset his understanding of themlike the stones appearance He kept up a brisk pace and the leagues steadily disappeared In late evening he arrived at the edge of a precipitous ravine The Anora River rushed by far below heading to Palancar Valley Gorged with hundreds of tiny streams the river was a brute force battling against the rocks and boulders that barred its way A low rumble filled the air He camped in a thicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed It grew colder over the next day and a half Eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the wary wildlife A bit past noon he heard the Igualda Falls blanketing everything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes The trail led him onto a moist slate outcropping which the river sped past flinging itself into empty air and down mossy cliffs Before him lay Palancar Valley exposed like an unrolled map The base of the Igualda Falls more than a halfmile below was the northernmost point of the valley A little ways from the falls was Carvahall a cluster of brown buildings White smoke rose from the chimneys defiant of the wilderness around it At this height farms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger The land around them was tan or sandy where dead grass swayed in the wind The Anora River wound from the falls toward Palancars southern end reflecting great strips of sunlight Far in the distance it flowed past the village Therinsford and the lonely mountain Utgard Beyond that he knew only that it turned north and ran to the sea After a pause Eragon left the outcropping and started down the trail grimacing at the descent When he arrived at the bottom soft dusk was creeping over everything blurring colors and shapes into gray masses Carvahalls lights shimmered nearby in the twilight the houses cast long shadows Aside from Therinsford Carvahall was the only village in Palancar Valley The settlement was secluded and surrounded by harsh beautiful land Few traveled here except merchants and trappers The village was composed of stout log buildings with low roofssome thatched others shingled Smoke billowed from the chimneys giving the air a woody smell The buildings had wide porches where people gathered to talk and conduct business Occasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit Eragon heard men talking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands scolding them for being late Eragon wove his way between the houses to the butchers shop a broad thickbeamed building Overhead the chimney belched black smoke He pushed the door open The spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a stone fireplace A bare counter stretched across the far side of the room The floor was strewn with loose straw Everything was scrupulously clean as if the owner spent his leisure time digging in obscure crannies for minuscule pieces of filth Behind the counter stood the butcher Sloan A small man he wore a cotton shirt and a long bloodstained smock An impressive array of knives swung from his belt He had a sallow pockmarked face and his black eyes were suspicious He polished the counter with a ragged cloth Sloans mouth twisted as Eragon entered Well the mighty hunter joins the rest of us mortals How many did you bag this time None was Eragons curt reply He had never liked Sloan The butcher always treated him with disdain as if he were something unclean A widower Sloan seemed to care for only one personhis daughter Katrina on whom he doted Im amazed said Sloan with affected astonishment He turned his back on Eragon to scrape something off the wall And thats your reason for coming here Yes admitted Eragon uncomfortably If thats the case lets see your money Sloan tapped his fingers when Eragon shifted his feet and remained silent Come oneither you have it or you dont Which is it I dont really have any money but I do What no money the butcher cut him off sharply And you expect to buy meat Are the other merchants giving away their wares Should I just hand you the goods without charge Besides he said abruptly its late Come back tomorrow with money Im closed for the day Eragon glared at him I cant wait until tomorrow Sloan Itll be worth your while though I found something to pay you with He pulled out the stone with a flourish and set it gently on the scarred counter where it gleamed with light from the dancing flames Stole it is more likely muttered Sloan leaning forward with an interested expression Ignoring the comment Eragon asked Will this be enough Sloan picked up the stone and gauged its weight speculatively He ran his hands over its smoothness and inspected the white veins With a calculating look he set it down Its pretty but how much is it worth I dont know admitted Eragon but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it unless it had some value Obviously said Sloan with exaggerated patience But how much value Since you dont know I suggest that you find a trader who does or take my offer of three crowns Thats a misers bargain It must be worth at least ten times that protested Eragon Three crowns would not even buy enough meat to last a week Sloan shrugged If you dont like my offer wait until the traders arrive Either way Im tired of this conversation The traders were a nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited Carvahall every spring and winter They bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers had managed to grow or make and sold what they needed to live through another year seeds animals fabric and supplies like salt and sugar But Eragon did not want to wait until they arrived it could be a while and his family needed the meat now Fine I accept he snapped Good Ill get you the meat Not that it matters but where did you find this Two nights ago in the Spine Get out demanded Sloan pushing the stone away He stomped furiously to the end of the counter and started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife Why asked Eragon He drew the stone closer as if to protect it from Sloans wrath I wont deal with anything you bring back from those damned mountains Take your sorcerers stone elsewhere Sloans hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the knife but he seemed not to notice He continued to scrub staining the blade with fresh blood You refuse to sell to me Yes Unless you pay with coins Sloan growled and hefted the knife sidling away Go before I make you The door behind them slammed open Eragon whirled around ready for more trouble In stomped Horst a hulking man Sloans daughter Katrinaa tall girl of sixteentrailed behind him with a determined expression Eragon was surprised to see her she usually absented herself from any arguments involving her father Sloan glanced at them warily then started to accuse Eragon He wont Quiet announced Horst in a rumbling voice cracking his knuckles at the same time He was Carvahalls smith as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested His powerful arms were bare to the elbow a great expanse of hairy muscular chest was visible through the top of his shirt A black beard carelessly trimmed roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles Sloan what have you done now Nothing He gave Eragon a murderous gaze then spat This boy came in here and started badgering me I asked him to leave but he wont budge I even threatened him and he still ignored me Sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at Horst Is this true demanded the smith No replied Eragon I offered this stone as payment for some meat and he accepted it When I told him that Id found it in the Spine he refused to even touch it What difference does it make where it came from Horst looked at the stone curiously then returned his attention to the butcher Why wont you trade with him Sloan Ive no love for the Spine myself but if its a question of the stones worth Ill back it with my own money The question hung in the air for a moment Then Sloan licked his lips and said This is my own store I can do whatever I want Katrina stepped out from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten copper Father Eragonis willing to pay Give him the meat and then we can have supper Sloans eyes narrowed dangerously Go back to the house this is none of your business I saidgo Katrinas face hardened then she marched out of the room with a stiff back Eragon watched with disapproval but dared not interfere Horst tugged at his beard before saying reproachfully Fine you can deal with me What were you going to get Eragon His voice reverberated through the room As much as I could Horst pulled out a purse and counted out a pile of coins Give me your best roasts and steaks Make sure that its enough to fill Eragons pack The butcher hesitated his gaze darting between Horst and Eragon Not selling to me would be a very bad idea stated Horst Glowering venomously Sloan slipped into the back room A frenzy of chopping wrapping and low cursing reached them After several uncomfortable minutes he returned with an armful of wrapped meat His face was expressionless as he accepted Horsts money then proceeded to clean his knife pretending that they were not there Horst scooped up the meat and walked outside Eragon hurried behind him carrying his pack and the stone The crisp night air rolled over their faces refreshing after the stuffy shop Thank you Horst Uncle Garrow will be pleased Horst laughed quietly Dont thank me Ive wanted to do that for a long time Sloans a vicious troublemaker it does him good to be humbled Katrina heard what was happening and ran to fetch me Good thing I camethe two of you were almost at blows Unfortunately I doubt hell serve you or any of your family the next time you go in there even if you do have coins Why did he explode like that Weve never been friendly but hes always taken our money And Ive never seen him treat Katrina that way said Eragon opening the top of the pack Horst shrugged Ask your uncle He knows more about it than I do Eragon stuffed the meat into his pack Well now I have one more reason to hurry home to solve this mystery Here this is rightfully yours He proffered the stone Horst chuckled No you keep your strange rock As for payment Albriech plans to leave for Feinster next spring He wants to become a master smith and Im going to need an assistant You can come and work off the debt on your spare days Eragon bowed slightly delighted Horst had two sons Albriech and Baldor both of whom worked in his forge Taking ones place was a generous offer Again thank you I look forward to working with you He was glad that there was a way for him to pay Horst His uncle would never accept charity Then Eragon remembered what his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt Roran wanted me to give Katrina a message but since I cant can you get it to her Of course He wants her to know that hell come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will see her then That all Eragon was slightly embarrassed No he also wants her to know that she is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else Horsts face broke into a broad grin and he winked at Eragon Getting serious isnt he Yes sir Eragon answered with a quick smile Could you also give her my thanks It was nice of her to stand up to her father for me I hope that she isnt punished because of it Roran would be furious if I got her into trouble I wouldnt worry about it Sloan doesnt know that she called me so I doubt hell be too hard on her Before you go will you sup with us Im sorry but I cant Garrow is expecting me said Eragon tying off the top of the pack He hoisted it onto his back and started down the road raising his hand in farewell The meat slowed him down but he was eager to be home and renewed vigor filled his steps The village ended abruptly and he left its warm lights behind The pearlescent moon peeked over the mountains bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of daylight Everything looked bleached and flat Near the end of his journey he turned off the road which continued south A simple path led straight through waisthigh grass and up a knoll almost hidden by the shadows of protective elm trees He crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining from his home The house had a shingled roof and a brick chimney Eaves hung over the whitewashed walls shadowing the ground below One side of the enclosed porch was filled with split wood ready for the fire A jumble of farm tools cluttered the other side The house had been abandoned for half a century when they moved in after Garrows wife Marian died It was ten miles from Carvahall farther than anyone elses People considered the distance dangerous because the family could not rely on help from the village in times of trouble but Eragons uncle would not listen A hundred feet from the house in a dullcolored barn lived two horsesBirka and Brughwith chickens and a cow Sometimes there was also a pig but they had been unable to afford one this year A wagon sat wedged between the stalls On the edge of their fields a thick line of trees traced along the Anora River He saw a light move behind a window as he wearily reached the porch Uncle its Eragon Let me in A small shutter slid back for a second then the door swung inward Garrow stood with his hand on the door His worn clothes hung on him like rags on a stick frame A lean hungry face with intense eyes gazed out from under graying hair He looked like a man who had been partly mummified before it was discovered that he was still alive Rorans sleeping was his answer to Eragons inquiring glance A lantern flickered on a wood table so old that the grain stood up in tiny ridges like a giant fingerprint Near a woodstove were rows of cooking utensils tacked onto the wall with homemade nails A second door opened to the rest of the house The floor was made of boards polished smooth by years of tramping feet Eragon pulled off his pack and took out the meat Whats this Did you buy meat Where did you get the money asked his uncle harshly as he saw the wrapped packages Eragon took a breath before answering No Horst bought it for us You let him pay for it I told you before I wont beg for our food If we cant feed ourselves we might as well move into town Before you can turn around twice theyll be sending us used clothes and asking if well be able to get through the winter Garrows face paled with anger I didnt accept charity snapped Eragon Horst agreed to let me work off the debt this spring He needs someone to help him because Albriech is going away And where will you get the time to work for him Are you going to ignore all the things that need to be done here asked Garrow forcing his voice down Eragon hung his bow and quiver on hooks beside the front door I dont know how Ill do it he said irritably Besides I found something that could be worth some money He set the stone on the table Garrow bowed over it the hungry look on his face became ravenous and his fingers moved with a strange twitch You found this in the Spine Yes said Eragon He explained what had happened And to make matters worse I lost my best arrow Ill have to make more before long They stared at the stone in the near darkness How was the weather asked his uncle lifting the stone His hands tightened around it like he was afraid it would suddenly disappear Cold was Eragons reply It didnt snow but it froze each night Garrow looked worried by the news Tomorrow youll have to help Roran finish harvesting the barley If we can get the squash picked too the frost wont bother us He passed the stone to Eragon Here keep it When the traders come well find out what its worth Selling it is probably the best thing to do The less were involved with magic the better Why did Horst pay for the meat It took only a moment for Eragon to explain his argument with Sloan I just dont understand what angered him so Garrow shrugged Sloans wife Ismira went over the Igualda Falls a year before you were brought here He hasnt been near the Spine since nor had anything to do with it But thats no reason to refuse payment I think he wanted to give you trouble Eragon swayed blearily and said Its good to be back Garrows eyes softened and he nodded Eragon stumbled to his room pushed the stone under his bed then fell onto the mattressHome For the first time since before the hunt he relaxed completely as sleep overtook him D RAGONTALES At dawn the suns rays streamed through the window warming Eragons face Rubbing his eyes he sat up on the edge of the bed The pine floor was cold under his feet He stretched his sore legs and rubbed his back yawning Beside the bed was a row of shelves covered with objects he had collected There were twisted pieces of wood odd bits of shells rocks that had broken to reveal shiny interiors and strips of dry grass tied into knots His favorite item was a root so convoluted he never tired of looking at it The rest of the room was bare except for a small dresser and nightstand He pulled on his boots and stared at the floor thinking This was a special day It was near this very hour sixteen years ago that his mother Selena had come home to Carvahall alone and pregnant She had been gone for six years living in the cities When she returned she wore expensive clothes and her hair was bound by a net of pearls She had sought out her brother Garrow and asked to stay with him until the baby arrived Within five months her son was born Everyone was shocked when Selena tearfully begged Garrow and Marian to raise him When they asked why she only wept and said I must Her pleas had grown increasingly desperate until they finally agreed She named him Eragon then departed early the next morning and never returned Eragon still remembered how he had felt when Marian told him the story before she died The realization that Garrow and Marian were not his real parents had disturbed him greatly Things that had been permanent and unquestionable were suddenly thrown into doubt Eventually he had learned to live with it but he always had a nagging suspicion that he had not been good enough for his motherIm sure there was a good reason for what she did I only wish I knew what it was One other thing bothered him Who was his father Selena had told no one and whoever it might be had never come looking for Eragon He wished that he knew who it was if only to have a name It would be nice to know his heritage He sighed and went to the nightstand where he splashed his face shivering as the water ran down his neck Refreshed he retrieved the stone from under the bed and set it on a shelf The morning light caressed it throwing a warm shadow on the wall He touched it one more time then hurried to the kitchen eager to see his family Garrow and Roran were already there eating chicken As Eragon greeted them Roran stood with a grin Roran was two years older than Eragon muscular sturdy and careful with his movements They could not have been closer even if they had been real brothers Roran smiled Im glad youre back How was the trip Hard replied Eragon Did Uncle tell you what happened He helped himself to a piece of chicken which he devoured hungrily No said Roran and the story was quickly told At Rorans insistence Eragon left his food to show him the stone This elicited a satisfactory amount of awe but Roran soon asked nervously Were you able to talk with Katrina No there wasnt an opportunity after the argument with Sloan But shell expect you when the traders come I gave the message to Horst he will get it to her You told Horst said Roran incredulously That was private If I wanted everyone to know about it I could have built a bonfire and used smoke signals to communicate If Sloan finds out he wont let me see her again Horst will be discreet assured Eragon He wont let anyone fall prey to Sloan least of all you Roran seemed unconvinced but argued no more They returned to their meals in the taciturn presence of Garrow When the last bites were finished all three went to work in the fields The sun was cold and pale providing little comfort Under its watchful eye the last of the barley was stored in the barn Next they gathered prickly vined squash then the rutabagas beets peas turnips and beans which they packed into the root cellar After hours of labor they stretched their cramped muscles pleased that the harvest was finished The following days were spent pickling salting shelling and preparing the food for winter Nine days after Eragons return a vicious blizzard blew out of the mountains and settled over the valley The snow came down in great sheets blanketing the countryside in white They only dared leave the house for firewood and to feed the animals for they feared getting lost in the howling wind and featureless landscape They spent their time huddled over the stove as gusts rattled the heavy window shutters Days later the storm finally passed revealing an alien world of soft white drifts Im afraid the traders may not come this year with conditions this bad said Garrow Theyre late as it is Well give them a chance and wait before going to Carvahall But if they dont show soon well have to buy any spare supplies from the townspeople His countenance was resigned They grew anxious as the days crept by without sign of the traders Talk was sparse and depression hung over the house On the eighth morning Roran walked to the road and confirmed that the traders had not yet passed The day was spent readying for the trip into Carvahall scrounging with grim expressions for saleable items That evening out of desperation Eragon checked the road again He found deep ruts cut into the snow with numerous hoofprints between them Elated he ran back to the house whooping bringing new life to their preparations They packed their surplus produce into the wagon before sunrise Garrow put the years money in a leather pouch that he carefully fastened to his belt Eragon set the wrapped stone between bags of grain so it would not roll when the wagon hit bumps After a hasty breakfast they harnessed the horses and cleared a path to the road The traders wagons had already broken the drifts which sped their progress By noon they could see Carvahall In daylight it was a small earthy village filled with shouts and laughter The traders had made camp in an empty field on the outskirts of town Groups of wagons tents and fires were randomly spread across it spots of color against the snow The troubadours four tents were garishly decorated A steady stream of people linked the camp to the village Crowds churned around a line of bright tents and booths clogging the main street Horses whinnied at the noise The snow had been pounded flat giving it a glassy surface elsewhere bonfires had melted it Roasted hazelnuts added a rich aroma to the smells wafting around them Garrow parked the wagon and picketed the horses then drew coins from his pouch Get yourselves some treats Roran do what you want only be at Horsts in time for supper Eragon bring that stone and come with me Eragon grinned at Roran and pocketed the money already planning how to spend it Roran departed immediately with a determined expression on his face Garrow led Eragon into the throng shouldering his way through the bustle Women were buying cloth while nearby their husbands examined a new latch hook or tool Children ran up and down the road shrieking with excitement Knives were displayed here spices there and pots were laid out in shiny rows next to leather harnesses Eragon stared at the traders curiously They seemed less prosperous than last year Their children had a frightened wary look and their clothes were patched The gaunt men carried swords and daggers with a new familiarity and even the women had poniards belted at their waists What could have happened to make them like this And why are they so latewondered Eragon He remembered the traders as being full of good cheer but there was none of that now Garrow pushed down the street searching for Merlock a trader who specialized in odd trinkets and pieces of jewelry They found him behind a booth displaying brooches to a group of women As each new piece was revealed exclamations of admiration followed Eragon guessed that more than a few purses would soon be depleted Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every time his wares were complimented He wore a goatee held himself with ease and seemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt The excited group prevented Garrow and Eragon from getting near the trader so they settled on a step and waited As soon as Merlock was unoccupied they hurried over And what might you sirs want to look at asked Merlock An amulet or trinket for a lady With a twirl he pulled out a delicately carved silver rose of excellent workmanship The polished metal caught Eragons attention and he eyed it appreciatively The trader continued Not even three crowns though it has come all the way from the famed craftsmen of Belatona Garrow spoke in a quiet voice We arent looking to buy but to sell Merlock immediately covered the rose and looked at them with new interest I see Maybe if this item is of any value you would like to trade it for one or two of these exquisite pieces He paused for a moment while Eragon and his uncle stood uncomfortably then continued You didbring the object of consideration We have it but we would rather show it to you elsewhere said Garrow in a firm voice Merlock raised an eyebrow but spoke smoothly In that case let me invite you to my tent He gathered up his wares and gently laid them in an ironbound chest which he locked Then he ushered them up the street and into the temporary camp They wound between the wagons to a tent removed from the rest of the traders It was crimson at the top and sable at the bottom with thin triangles of colors stabbing into each other Merlock untied the opening and swung the flap to one side Small trinkets and strange pieces of furniture such as a round bed and three seats carved from tree stumps filled the tent A gnarled dagger with a ruby in the pommel rested on a white cushion Merlock closed the flap and turned to them Please seat yourselves When they had he said Now show me why we are meeting in private Eragon unwrapped the stone and set it between the two men Merlock reached for it with a gleam in his eye then stopped and asked May I When Garrow indicated his approval Merlock picked it up He put the stone in his lap and reached to one side for a thin box Opened it revealed a large set of copper scales which he set on the ground After weighing the stone he scrutinized its surface under a jewelers glass tapped it gently with a wooden mallet and drew the point of a tiny clear stone over it He measured its length and diameter then recorded the figures on a slate He considered the results for a while Do you know what this is worth No admitted Garrow His cheek twitched and he shifted uncomfortably on the seat Merlock grimaced Unfortunately neither do I But I can tell you this much the white veins are the same material as the blue that surrounds them only a different color What that material might be though I havent a clue Its harder than any rock I have seen harder even than diamond Whoever shaped it used tools I have never seenor magic Also its hollow What exclaimed Garrow An irritated edge crept into Merlocks voice Did you ever hear a rock sound like this He grabbed the dagger from the cushion and slapped the stone with the flat of the blade A pure note filled the air then faded away smoothly Eragon was alarmed afraid that the stone had been damaged Merlock tilted the stone toward them You will find no scratches or blemishes where the dagger struck I doubt I could do anything to harm this stone even if I took a hammer to it Garrow crossed his arms with a reserved expression A wall of silence surrounded him Eragon was puzzledI knew that the stone appeared in the Spine through magic but made by magic What for and why He blurted But what is it worth I cant tell you that said Merlock in a pained voice I am sure there are people who would pay dearly to have it but none of them are in Carvahall You would have to go to the southern cities to find a buyer This is a curiosity for most peoplenot an item to spend money on when practical things are needed Garrow stared at the tent ceiling like a gambler calculating the odds Will you buy it The trader answered instantly Its not worth the risk I might be able to find a wealthy buyer during my spring travels but I cant be certain Even if I did you wouldnt be paid until I returned next year No you will have to find someone else to trade with I am curious however Why did you insist on talking to me in private Eragon put the stone away before answering Because he glanced at the man wondering if he would explode like Sloan I found this in the Spine and folks around here dont like that Merlock gave him a startled look Do you know why my fellow merchants and I were late this year Eragon shook his head Our wanderings have been dogged with misfortune Chaos seems to rule Alagaësia We could not avoid illness attacks and the most cursed black luck Because the Vardens attacks have increased Galbatorix has forced cities to send more soldiers to the borders men who are needed to combat the Urgals The brutes have been migrating southeast toward the Hadarac Desert No one knows why and it wouldnt concern us except that theyre passing through populated areas Theyve been spotted on roads and near cities Worst of all are reports of a Shade though the stories are unconfirmed Not many people survive such an encounter Why havent we heard of this cried Eragon Because said Merlock grimly it only began a few months ago Whole villages have been forced to move because Urgals destroyed their fields and starvation threatens Nonsense growled Garrow We havent seen any Urgals the only one around here has his horns mounted in Morns tavern Merlock arched an eyebrow Maybe so but this is a small village hidden by mountains Its not surprising that youve escaped notice However I wouldnt expect that to last I only mentioned this because strange things are happening here as well if you found such a stone in the Spine With that sobering statement he bid them farewell with a bow and slight smile Garrow headed back to Carvahall with Eragon trailing behind What do you think asked Eragon Im going to get more information before I make up my mind Take the stone back to the wagon then do what you want Ill meet you for dinner at Horsts Eragon dodged through the crowd and happily dashed back to the wagon Trading would take his uncle hours time that he planned to enjoy fully He hid the stone under the bags then set out into town with a cocky stride He walked from one booth to another evaluating the goods with a buyers eye despite his meager supply of coins When he talked with the merchants they confirmed what Merlock had said about the instability in Alagaësia Over and over the message was repeated last years security has deserted us new dangers have appeared and nothing is safe Later in the day he bought three sticks of malt candy and a small pipinghot cherry pie The hot food felt good after hours of standing in the snow He licked the sticky syrup from his fingers regretfully wishing for more then sat on the edge of a porch and nibbled a piece of candy Two boys from Carvahall wrestled nearby but he felt no inclination to join them As the day descended into late afternoon the traders took their business into peoples homes Eragon was impatient for evening when the troubadours would come out to tell stories and perform tricks He loved hearing about magic gods and if they were especially lucky the Dragon Riders Carvahall had its own storyteller Broma friend of Eragonsbut his tales grew old over the years whereas the troubadours always had new ones that he listened to eagerly Eragon had just broken off an icicle from the underside of the porch when he spotted Sloan nearby The butcher had not seen him so Eragon ducked his head and bolted around a corner toward Morns tavern The inside was hot and filled with greasy smoke from sputtering tallow candles The shinyblack Urgal horns their twisted span as great as his outstretched arms were mounted over the door The bar was long and low with a stack of staves on one end for customers to carve Morn tended the bar his sleeves rolled up to his elbows The bottom half of his face was short and mashed as if he had rested his chin on a grinding wheel People crowded solid oak tables and listened to two traders who had finished their business early and had come in for beer Morn looked up from a mug he was cleaning Eragon Good to see you Wheres your uncle Buying said Eragon with a shrug Hes going to be a while And Roran is he here asked Morn as he swiped the cloth through another mug Yes no sick animals to keep him back this year Good good Eragon gestured at the two traders Who are they Grain buyers They bought everyones seed at ridiculously low prices and now theyre telling wild stories expecting us to believe them Eragon understood why Morn was so upsetPeople need that money We cant get by without it What kind of stories Morn snorted They say the Varden have formed a pact with the Urgals and are massing an army to attack usSupposedly its only through the grace of our king that weve been protected for so longas if Galbatorix would care if we burned to the ground Go listen to them I have enough on my hands without explaining their lies The first trader filled a chair with his enormous girth his every movement caused it to protest loudly There was no hint of hair on his face his pudgy hands were baby smooth and he had pouting lips that curled petulantly as he sipped from a flagon The second man had a florid face The skin around his jaw was dry and corpulent filled with lumps of hard fat like cold butter gone rancid Contrasted with his neck and jowls the rest of his body was unnaturally thin The first trader vainly tried to pull back his expanding borders to fit within the chair He said No no you dont understand It is only through the kings unceasing efforts on your behalf that you are able to argue with us in safety If he in all his wisdom were to withdraw that support woe unto you Someone hollered Right why dont you also tell us the Riders have returned and youve each killed a hundred elves Do you think were children to believe in your tales We can take care of ourselves The group chuckled The trader started to reply when his thin companion intervened with a wave of his hand Gaudy jewels flashed on his fingers You misunderstand We know the Empire can not care for each of us personally as you may want but it can keep Urgals and other abominations from overrunning this he searched vaguely for the right term place The trader continued Youre angry with the Empire for treating people unfairly a legitimate concern but a government can not please everyone There will inevitably be arguments and conflicts However the majority of us have nothing to complain about Every country has some small group of malcontents who arent satisfied with the balance of power Yeah called a woman if youre willing to call the Varden small The fat man sighed We already explained that the Varden have no interest in helping you Thats only a falsehood perpetuated by the traitors in an attempt to disrupt the Empire and convince us that the real threat is insidenot outsideour borders All they want to do is overthrow the king and take possession of our land They have spies everywhere as they prepare to invade You never know who might be working for them Eragon did not agree but the traders words were smooth and people were nodding He stepped forward and said How do you know this I can say that clouds are green but that doesnt mean its true Prove you arent lying The two men glared at him while the villagers waited silently for the answer The thin trader spoke first He avoided Eragons eyes Arent your children taught respect Or do you let boys challenge men whenever they want to The listeners fidgeted and stared at Eragon Then a man said Answer the question Its only common sense said the fat one sweat beading on his upper lip His reply riled the villagers and the dispute resumed Eragon returned to the bar with a sour taste in his mouth He had never before met anyone who favored the Empire and tore down its enemies There was a deepseated hatred of the Empire in Carvahall almost hereditary in nature The Empire never helped them during harsh years when they nearly starved and its tax collectors were heartless He felt justified in disagreeing with the traders regarding the kings mercy but he did speculate about the Varden The Varden were a rebel group that constantly raided and attacked the Empire It was a mystery who their leader was or who had formed them in the years following Galbatorixs rise to power over a century ago The group had garnered much sympathy as they eluded Galbatorixs efforts to destroy them Little was known about the Varden except that if you were a fugitive and had to hide or if you hated the Empire they would accept you The only problem was finding them Morn leaned over the bar and said Incredible isnt it Theyre worse than vultures circling a dying animal Theres going to be trouble if they stay much longer For us or for them Them said Morn as angry voices filled the tavern Eragon left when the argument threatened to become violent The door thudded shut behind him cutting off the voices It was early evening and the sun was sinking rapidly the houses cast long shadows on the ground As Eragon headed down the street he noticed Roran and Katrina standing in an alley Roran said something Eragon could not hear Katrina looked down at her hands and answered in an undertone then leaned up on her tiptoes and kissed him before darting away Eragon trotted to Roran and teased Having a good time Roran grunted noncommittally as he paced away Have you heard the traders news asked Eragon following Most of the villagers were indoors talking to traders or waiting until it was dark enough for the troubadours to perform Yes Roran seemed distracted What do you think of Sloan I thought it was obvious Therell be blood between us when he finds out about Katrina and me stated Roran A snowflake landed on Eragons nose and he looked up The sky had turned gray He could think of nothing appropriate to say Roran was right He clasped his cousin on the shoulder as they continued down the byway Dinner at Horsts was hearty The room was full of conversation and laughter Sweet cordials and heavy ales were consumed in copious amounts adding to the boisterous atmosphere When the plates were empty Horsts guests left the house and strolled to the field where the traders were camped A ring of poles topped with candles had been stuck into the ground around a large clearing Bonfires blazed in the background painting the ground with dancing shadows The villagers slowly gathered around the circle and waited expectantly in the cold The troubadours came tumbling out of their tents dressed in tasseled clothing followed by older and more stately minstrels The minstrels provided music and narration as their younger counterparts acted out the stories The first plays were pure entertainment bawdy and full of jokes pratfalls and ridiculous characters Later however when the candles sputtered in their sockets and everyone was drawn together into a tight circle the old storyteller Brom stepped forward A knotted white beard rippled over his chest and a long black cape was wrapped around his bent shoulders obscuring his body He spread his arms with hands that reached out like talons and recited thus The sands of time can not be stopped Years pass whether we will them or not but we can remember What has been lost may yet live on in memories That which you will hear is imperfect and fragmented yet treasure it for without you it does not exist I give you now a memory that has been forgotten hidden in the dreamy haze that lies behind us His keen eyes inspected their interested faces His gaze lingered on Eragon last of all Before your grandfathers fathers were born and yea even before their fathers the Dragon Riders were formed To protect and guard was their mission and for thousands of years they succeeded Their prowess in battle was unmatched for each had the strength of ten men They were immortal unless blade or poison took them For good only were their powers used and under their tutelage tall cities and towers were built out of the living stone While they kept peace the land flourished It was a golden time The elves were our allies the dwarves our friends Wealth flowed into our cities and men prospered But weep for it could not last Brom looked down silently Infinite sadness resonated in his voice Though no enemy could destroy them they could not guard against themselves And it came to pass at the height of their power that a boy Galbatorix by name was born in the province of Inzilbêth which is no more At ten he was tested as was the custom and it was found that great power resided in him The Riders accepted him as their own Through their training he passed exceeding all others in skill Gifted with a sharp mind and strong body he quickly took his place among the Riders ranks Some saw his abrupt rise as dangerous and warned the others but the Riders had grown arrogant in their power and ignored caution Alas sorrow was conceived that day So it was that soon after his training was finished Galbatorix took a reckless trip with two friends Far north they flew night and day and passed into the Urgals remaining territory foolishly thinking their new powers would protect them There on a thick sheet of ice unmelted even in summer they were ambushed in their sleep Though his friends and their dragons were butchered and he suffered great wounds Galbatorix slew his attackers Tragically during the fight a stray arrow pierced his dragons heart Without the arts to save her she died in his arms Then were the seeds of madness planted The storyteller clasped his hands and looked around slowly shadows flickering across his worn face The next words came like the mournful toll of a requiem Alone bereft of much of his strength and half mad with loss Galbatorix wandered without hope in that desolate land seeking death It did not come to him though he threw himself without fear against any living thing Urgals and other monsters soon fled from his haunted form During this time he came to realize that the Riders might grant him another dragon Driven by this thought he began the arduous journey on foot back through the Spine Territory he had soared over effortlessly on a dragons back now took him months to traverse He could hunt with magic but oftentimes he walked in places where animals did not travel Thus when his feet finally left the mountains he was close to death A farmer found him collapsed in the mud and summoned the Riders Unconscious he was taken to their holdings and his body healed He slept for four days Upon awakening he gave no sign of his fevered mind When he was brought before a council convened to judge him Galbatorix demanded another dragon The desperation of the request revealed his dementia and the council saw him for what he truly was Denied his hope Galbatorix through the twisted mirror of his madness came to believe it was the Riders fault his dragon had died Night after night he brooded on that and formulated a plan to exact revenge Broms words dropped to a mesmerizing whisper He found a sympathetic Rider and there his insidious words took root By persistent reasoning and the use of dark secrets learned from a Shade he inflamed the Rider against their elders Together they treacherously lured and killed an elder When the foul deed was done Galbatorix turned on his ally and slaughtered him without warning The Riders found him then with blood dripping from his hands A scream tore from his lips and he fled into the night As he was cunning in his madness they could not find him For years he hid in wastelands like a hunted animal always watching for pursuers His atrocity was not forgotten but over time searches ceased Then through some ill fortune he met a young Rider Morzanstrong of body but weak of mind Galbatorix convinced Morzan to leave a gate unbolted in the citadel Ilirea which is now called Urûbaen Through this gate Galbatorix entered and stole a dragon hatchling He and his new disciple hid themselves in an evil place where the Riders dared not venture There Morzan entered into a dark apprenticeship learning secrets and forbidden magic that should never have been revealed When his instruction was finished and Galbatorixs black dragon Shruikan was fully grown Galbatorix revealed himself to the world with Morzan at his side Together they fought any Rider they met With each kill their strength grew Twelve of the Riders joined Galbatorix out of desire for power and revenge against perceived wrongs Those twelve with Morzan became the Thirteen Forsworn The Riders were unprepared and fell beneath the onslaught The elves too fought bitterly against Galbatorix but they were overthrown and forced to flee to their secret places from whence they come no more Only Vrael leader of the Riders could resist Galbatorix and the Forsworn Ancient and wise he struggled to save what he could and keep the remaining dragons from falling to his enemies In the last battle before the gates of Dorú Areaba Vrael defeated Galbatorix but hesitated with the final blow Galbatorix seized the moment and smote him in the side Grievously wounded Vrael fled to Utgard Mountain where he hoped to gather strength But it was not to be for Galbatorix found him As they fought Galbatorix kicked Vrael in the fork of his legs With that underhanded blow he gained dominance over Vrael and removed his head with a blazing sword Then as power rushed through his veins Galbatorix anointed himself king over all Alagaësia And from that day he has ruled us With the completion of the story Brom shuffled away with the troubadours Eragon thought he saw a tear shining on his cheek People murmured quietly to each other as they departed Garrow said to Eragon and Roran Consider yourselves fortunate I have heard this tale only twice in my life If the Empire knew that Brom had recited it he would not live to see a new month F ATESGIFT The evening after their return from Carvahall Eragon decided to test the stone as Merlock had Alone in his room he set it on his bed and laid three tools next to it He started with a wooden mallet and lightly tapped the stone It produced a subtle ringing Satisfied he picked up the next tool a heavy leather hammer A mournful peal reverberated when it struck Lastly he pounded a small chisel against it The metal did not chip or scratch the stone but it produced the clearest sound yet As the final note died away he thought he heard a faint squeak Merlock said the stone was hollow there could be something of value inside I dont know how to open it though There must have been a good reason for someone to shape it but whoever sent the stone into the Spine hasnt taken the trouble to retrieve it or doesnt know where it is But I dont believe that a magician with enough power to transport the stone wouldnt be able to find it again So was I meant to have itHe could not answer the question Resigned to an unsolvable mystery he picked up the tools and returned the stone to its shelf That night he was abruptly roused from sleep He listened carefully All was quiet Uneasy he slid his hand under the mattress and grasped his knife He waited a few minutes then slowly sank back to sleep A squeak pierced the silence tearing him back to wakefulness He rolled out of bed and yanked the knife from its sheath Fumbling with a tinderbox he lit a candle The door to his room was closed Though the squeak was too loud for a mouse or rat he still checked under the bed Nothing He sat on the edge of the mattress and rubbed the sleep from his eyes Another squeak filled the air and he started violently Where was the noise was coming from Nothing could be in the floor or walls they were solid wood The same went for his bed and he would have noticed if anything had crawled into his straw mattress during the night His eyes settled on the stone He took it off the shelf and absently cradled it as he studied the room A squeak rang in his ears and reverberated through his fingers it came from the stone The stone had given him nothing but frustration and anger and now it would not even let him sleep It ignored his furious glare and sat solidly occasionally peeping Then it gave one very loud squeak and fell silent Eragon warily put it away and got back under the sheets Whatever secret the stone held it would have to wait until morning The moon was shining through his window when he woke again The stone was rocking rapidly on the shelf knocking against the wall It was bathed in cool moonlight that bleached its surface Eragon jumped out of bed knife in hand The motion stopped but he remained tense Then the stone started squeaking and rocking faster than ever With an oath he began dressing He did not care how valuable the stone might be he was going to take it far away and bury it The rocking stopped the stone became quiet It quivered then rolled forward and dropped onto the floor with a loud thump He inched toward the door in alarm as the stone wobbled toward him Suddenly a crack appeared on the stone Then another and another Transfixed Eragon leaned forward still holding the knife At the top of the stone where all the cracks met a small piece wobbled as if it were balanced on something then rose and toppled to the floor After another series of squeaks a small dark head poked out of the hole followed by a weirdly angled body Eragon gripped the knife tighter and held very still Soon the creature was all the way out of the stone It stayed in place for a moment then skittered into the moonlight Eragon recoiled in shock Standing in front of him licking off the membrane that encased it was a dragon A WAKENING The dragon was no longer than his forearm yet it was dignified and noble Its scales were deep sapphire blue the same color as the stone But not a stone he realized an egg The dragon fanned its wings they were what had made it appear so contorted The wings were several times longer than its body and ribbed with thin fingers of bone that extended from the wings front edge forming a line of widely spaced talons The dragons head was roughly triangular Two diminutive white fangs curved down out of its upper jaw They looked very sharp Its claws were also white like polished ivory and slightly serrated on the inside curve A line of small spikes ran down the creatures spine from the base of its head to the tip of its tail A hollow where its neck and shoulders joined created a largerthannormal gap between the spikes Eragon shifted slightly and the dragons head snapped around Hard iceblue eyes fixed on him He kept very still It might be a formidable enemy if it decided to attack The dragon lost interest in Eragon and awkwardly explored the room squealing as it bumped into a wall or furniture With a flutter of wings it leapt onto the bed and crawled to his pillow squeaking Its mouth was open pitifully like a young birds displaying rows of pointed teeth Eragon sat cautiously on the end of the bed The dragon smelled his hand nibbled his sleeve He pulled his arm back A smile tugged at Eragons lips as he looked at the small creature Tentatively he reached out with his right hand and touched its flank A blast of icy energy surged into his hand and raced up his arm burning in his veins like liquid fire He fell back with a wild cry An iron clang filled his ears and he heard a soundless scream of rage Every part of his body seared with pain He struggled to move but was unable to After what seemed like hours warmth seeped back into his limbs leaving them tingling Shivering uncontrollably he pushed himself upright His hand was numb his fingers paralyzed Alarmed he watched as the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffused white oval The skin itched and burned like a spider bite His heart pounded frantically Eragon blinked trying to understand what had occurred Something brushed against his consciousness like a finger trailing over his skin He felt it again but this time it solidified into a tendril of thought through which he could feel a growing curiosity It was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had fallen away and he was now free to reach out with his mind He was afraid that without anything to hold him back he would float out of his body and be unable to return becoming a spirit of the ether Scared he pulled away from the contact The new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes He glared suspiciously at the motionless dragon A scaly leg scraped against his side and he jerked back But the energy did not shock him again Puzzled he rubbed the dragons head with his right hand A light tingling ran up his arm The dragon nuzzled him arching its back like a cat He slid a finger over its thin wing membranes They felt like old parchment velvety and warm but still slightly damp Hundreds of slender veins pulsed through them Again the tendril touched his mind but this time instead of curiosity he sensed an overpowering ravenous hunger He got up with a sigh This was a dangerous animal of that he was sure Yet it seemed so helpless crawling on his bed he could only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it The dragon wailed in a reedy tone as it looked for food Eragon quickly scratched its head to keep it quietIll think about this later he decided and left the room carefully closing the door Returning with two strips of dried meat he found the dragon sitting on the windowsill watching the moon He cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the dragon It smelled the square cautiously then jabbed its head forward like a snake and snatched the meat from his fingers swallowing it whole with a peculiar jerk The dragon prodded Eragons hand for more food He fed it careful to keep his fingers out of the way By the time there was only one square left the dragons belly was bulging He proffered the last piece the dragon considered it for a moment then lazily snapped it up Done eating it crawled onto his arm and curled against his chest Then it snorted a puff of dark smoke rising from its nostrils Eragon looked at it with wonder Just when he thought the dragon was asleep a low humming came from its vibrating throat Gently he carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow The dragon eyes closed wrapped its tail around the bedpost contentedly Eragon lay next to it flexing his hand in the near darkness He faced a painful dilemma By raising a dragon he could become a Rider Myths and stories about Riders were treasured and being one would automatically place him among those legends However if the Empire discovered the dragon he and his family would be put to death unless he joined the king No one couldor wouldhelp them The simplest solution was just to kill the dragon but the idea was repugnant and he rejected it Dragons were too revered for him to even consider thatBesides what could betray us he thoughtWe live in a remote area and have done nothing to draw attention The problem was convincing Garrow and Roran to let him keep the dragon Neither of them would care to have a dragon aroundI could raise it in secret In a month or two it will be too large for Garrow to get rid of but will he accept it Even if he does can I get enough food for the dragon while its hiding Its no larger than a small cat but it ate an entire handful of meat I suppose itll be able to hunt for itself eventually but how long until then Will it be able to survive the cold outside All the same he wanted the dragon The more he thought about it the surer he was However things might work out with Garrow Eragon would do everything he could to protect it Determined he fell asleep with the dragon cradled against him When dawn came the dragon was sitting atop his bedpost like an ancient sentinel welcoming the new day Eragon marveled at its color He had never seen such a clear hard blue Its scales were like hundreds of small gemstones He noticed that the white oval on his palm where he had touched the dragon had a silvery sheen He hoped he could hide it by keeping his hands dirty The dragon launched off the post and glided to the floor Eragon gingerly picked it up and left the quiet house pausing to grab meat several leather strips and as many rags as he could carry The crisp morning was beautiful a fresh layer of snow covered the farm He smiled as the small creature looked around with interest from the safety of his arms Hurrying across the fields he walked silently into the dark forest searching for a safe place for the dragon to stay Eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a barren knoll its branches snowtipped gray fingers that reached toward the sky He set the dragon down by the base of the trunk and shook the leather onto the ground With a few deft movements he made a noose and slipped it over the dragons head as it explored the snowy clumps surrounding the tree The leather was worn but it would hold He watched the dragon crawl around then untied the noose from its neck and fashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the dragon would not strangle itself Next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the branches layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat Snow fell on his face as the tree swayed He hung more rags over the front of the shelter to keep heat inside Pleased he surveyed his work Time to show you your new home he said and lifted the dragon up into the branches It wriggled trying to get free then clambered into the hut where it ate a piece of meat curled up and blinked coyly at him Youll be fine as long as you stay in here he instructed The dragon blinked again Sure that it had not understood him Eragon groped with his mind until he felt the dragons consciousness Again he had the terrible feeling ofopenness of a space so large it pressed down on him like a heavy blanket Summoning his strength he focused on the dragon and tried to impress on it one ideaStay here The dragon stopped moving and cocked its head at him He pushed harderStay here A dim acknowledgment came tentatively through the link but Eragon wondered if it really understoodAfter all its only an animal He retreated from the contact with relief and felt the safety of his own mind envelop him Eragon left the tree casting glances backward The dragon stuck its head out of the shelter and watched with large eyes as he left After a hurried walk home he sneaked back into his room to dispose of the egg fragments He was sure Garrow and Roran would not notice the eggs absenceit had faded from their thoughts after they learned it could not be sold When his family got up Roran mentioned that he had heard some noises during the night but to Eragons relief did not pursue the issue Eragons enthusiasm made the day go by quickly The mark on his hand proved easy to hide so he soon stopped worrying about it Before long he headed back to the rowan carrying sausages he had pilfered from the cellar With apprehension he approached the treeIs the dragon able to survive outside in winter His fears were groundless The dragon was perched on a branch gnawing on something between its front legs It started squeaking excitedly when it saw him He was pleased to see that it had remained in the tree above the reach of large predators As soon as he dropped the sausages at the base of the trunk the dragon glided down While it voraciously tore apart the food Eragon examined the shelter All the meat he had left was gone but the hut was intact and tufts of feathers littered the floorGood It can get its own food It struck him that he did not know if the dragon was a he or a she He lifted and turned it over ignoring its squeals of displeasure but was unable to find any distinguishing marksIt seems like it wont give up any secrets without a struggle He spent a long time with the dragon He untied it set it on his shoulder and went to explore the woods The snowladen trees watched over them like solemn pillars of a great cathedral In that isolation Eragon showed the dragon what he knew about the forest not caring if it understood his meaning It was the simple act of sharing that mattered He talked to it continuously The dragon gazed back at him with bright eyes drinking in his words For a while he just sat with it resting in his arms and watched it with wonder still stunned by recent events Eragon started for home at sunset conscious of two hard blue eyes drilling into his back indignant at being left behind That night he brooded about all the things that could happen to a small and unprotected animal Thoughts of ice storms and vicious animals tormented him It took hours for him to find sleep His dreams were of foxes and black wolves tearing at the dragon with bloody teeth In the sunrise glow Eragon ran from the house with food and scraps of clothextra insulation for the shelter He found the dragon awake and safe watching the sunrise from high in the tree He fervently thanked all the gods known and unknown The dragon came down to the ground as he approached and leapt into his arms huddling close to his chest The cold had not harmed it but it seemed frightened A puff of dark smoke blew out of its nostrils He stroked it comfortingly and sat with his back to the rowan murmuring softly He kept still as the dragon buried its head in his coat After a while it crawled out of his embrace and onto his shoulder He fed it then wrapped the new rags around the hut They played together for a time but Eragon had to return to the house before long A smooth routine was quickly established Every morning Eragon ran out to the tree and gave the dragon breakfast before hurrying back During the day he attacked his chores until they were finished and he could visit the dragon again Both Garrow and Roran noted his behavior and asked why he spent so much time outside Eragon just shrugged and started checking to make sure he was not followed to the tree After the first few days he stopped worrying that a mishap would befall the dragon Its growth was explosive it would soon be safe from most dangers The dragon doubled in size in the first week Four days later it was as high as his knee It no longer fit inside the hut in the rowan so Eragon was forced to build a hidden shelter on the ground The task took him three days When the dragon was a fortnight old Eragon was compelled to let it roam free because it needed so much food The first time he untied it only the force of his will kept it from following him back to the farm Every time it tried he pushed it away with his mind until it learned to avoid the house and its other inhabitants And he impressed on the dragon the importance of hunting only in the Spine where there was less chance of being seen Farmers would notice if game started disappearing from Palancar Valley It made him feel both safer and uneasy when the dragon was so far away The mental contact he shared with the dragon waxed stronger each day He found that although it did not comprehend words he could communicate with it through images or emotions It was an imprecise method however and he was often misunderstood The range at which they could touch each others thoughts expanded rapidly Soon Eragon could contact the dragon anywhere within three leagues He often did so and the dragon in turn would lightly brush against his mind These mute conversations filled his working hours There was always a small part of him connected to the dragon ignored at times but never forgotten When he talked with people the contact was distracting like a fly buzzing in his ear As the dragon matured its squeaks deepened to a roar and the humming became a low rumble yet the dragon did not breathe fire which concerned him He had seen it blow smoke when it was upset but there was never a hint of flame When the month ended Eragons elbow was level with the dragons shoulder In that brief span it had transformed from a small weak animal into a powerful beast Its hard scales were as tough as chainmail armor its teeth like daggers Eragon took long walks in the evening with the dragon padding beside him When they found a clearing he would settle against a tree and watch the dragon soar through the air He loved to see it fly and regretted that it was not yet big enough to ride He often sat beside the dragon and rubbed its neck feeling sinews and corded muscles flex under his hands Despite Eragons efforts the forest around the farm filled with signs of the dragons existence It was impossible to erase all the huge fourclawed footprints sunk deep in the snow and he refused even to try to hide the giant dung heaps that were becoming far too common The dragon had rubbed against trees stripping off the bark and had sharpened its claws on dead logs leaving gashes inches deep If Garrow or Roran went too far beyond the farms boundaries they would discover the dragon Eragon could imagine no worse way for the truth to come out so he decided to preempt it by explaining everything to them He wanted to do two things first though give the dragon a suitable name and learn more about dragons in general To that end he needed to talk with Brom master of epics and legendsthe only places where dragonlore survived So when Roran went to get a chisel repaired in Carvahall Eragon volunteered to go with him The evening before they left Eragon went to a small clearing in the forest and called the dragon with his mind After a moment he saw a fastmoving speck in the dusky sky The dragon dived toward him pulled up sharply then leveled off above the trees He heard a lowpitched whistle as air rushed over its wings It banked slowly to his left and spiraled gently down to the ground The dragon backflapped for balance with a deep muffledthwump as it landed Eragon opened his mind still uncomfortable with the strange sensation and told the dragon that he was leaving It snorted with unease He attempted to soothe it with a calming mental picture but the dragon whipped its tail unsatisfied He rested his hand on its shoulder and tried to radiate peace and serenity Scales bumped under his fingers as he patted it gently A single word rang in his head deep and clear Eragon It was solemn and sad as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed He stared at the dragon and a cold tingle ran down his arm Eragon A hard knot formed in his stomach as unfathomable sapphire eyes gazed back at him For the first time he did not think of the dragon as an animal It was something else something different He raced home trying to escape the dragonMy dragon Eragon T EA FORTWO Roran and Eragon parted at the outskirts of Carvahall Eragon walked slowly to Broms house engrossed in his thoughts He stopped at the doorstep and raised his hand to knock A voice rasped What do you want boy He whirled around Behind him Brom leaned on a twisted staff embellished with strange carvings He wore a brown hooded robe like a friar A pouch hung from the scuffed leather belt clasped around his waist Above his white beard a proud eagle nose hooked over his mouth and dominated his face He peered at Eragon with deepset eyes shadowed by a gnarled brow and waited for his reply To get information Eragon said Roran is getting a chisel fixed and I had free time so I came to see if you could answer a few questions The old man grunted and reached for the door Eragon noticed a gold ring on his right hand Light glinted off a sapphire highlighting a strange symbol carved on its face You might as well come in well be talking awhile Your questions never seem to end Inside the house was darker than charcoal an acrid smell heavy in the air Now for a light Eragon heard the old man move around then a low curse as something crashed to the floor Ah here we go A white spark flashed a flame wavered into existence Brom stood with a candle before a stone fireplace Stacks of books surrounded a highbacked deeply carved wooden chair that faced the mantel the four legs were shaped like eagle claws and the seat and back were padded with leather embossed with a swirling rose pattern A cluster of lesser chairs held piles of scrolls Ink pots and pens were scattered across a writing desk Make room for yourself but by the lost kings becareful This stuff is valuable Eragon stepped over pages of parchment covered with angular runes He gently lifted cracking scrolls off a chair and placed them on the floor A cloud of dust flew into the air as he sat He stifled a sneeze Brom bent down and lit the fire with his candle Good Nothing like sitting by a fire for conversation He threw back his hood to reveal hair that was not white but silver then hung a kettle over the flames and settled into the highbacked chair Now what do you want He addressed Eragon roughly but not unkindly Well said Eragon wondering how best to approach the subject I keep hearing about the Dragon Riders and their supposed accomplishments Most everyone seems to want them to return but Ive never heard tell of how they were started where the dragons came from or what made the Riders specialaside from the dragons A vast subject to tell about grumbled Brom He peered at Eragon alertly If I told you their whole story we would still be sitting here when winter comes again It will have to be reduced to a manageable length But before we start properly I need my pipe Eragon waited patiently as Brom tamped down the tobacco He liked Brom The old man was irascible at times but he never seemed to mind taking time for Eragon Eragon had once asked him where he came from and Brom had laughed saying A village much like Carvahall only not quite as interesting Curiosity aroused Eragon asked his uncle But Garrow could only tell him that Brom had bought a house in Carvahall nearly fifteen years ago and had lived there quietly ever since Brom used a tinderbox to light the pipe He puffed a few times then said There we wont have to stop except for the tea Now about the Riders or the Shurtugal as they are called by the elves Where to start They spanned countless years and at the height of their power held sway over twice the Empires lands Numerous stories have been told about them most nonsense If you believed everything said you would expect them to have the powers of a lesser god Scholars have devoted entire lives to separating these fictions from fact but its doubtful any of them will succeed However it isnt an impossible task if we confine ourselves to the three areas you specified how the Riders began why they were so highly regarded and where dragons came from I shall start with the last item Eragon settled back and listened to the mans mesmerizing voice Dragons have no beginning unless it lies with the creation of Alagaësia itself And if they have an end it will be when this world perishes for they suffer as the land does They the dwarves and a few others are the true inhabitants of this land They lived here before all others strong and proud in their elemental glory Their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on their silver ships Where did the elves come from interrupted Eragon And why are they called the fair folk Do they really exist Brom scowled Do you want your original questions answered or not They wont be if you want to explore every obscure piece of knowledge Sorry said Eragon He dipped his head and tried to look contrite No youre not said Brom with some amusement He shifted his gaze to the fire and watched it lick the underside of the kettle If you must know elves are not legends and they are called the fair folk because they are more graceful than any of the other races They come from what they call Alalea though none but they know what or even where it is Now he glared from under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more interruptions the elves were a proud race then and strong in magic At first they regarded dragons as mere animals From that belief rose a deadly mistake A brash elven youth hunted down a dragon as he would a stag and killed it Outraged the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf Unfortunately the bloodletting did not stop there The dragons massed together and attacked the entire elven nation Dismayed by the terrible misunderstanding the elves tried to end the hostilities but couldnt find a way to communicate with the dragons Thus to greatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences there was a very long and very bloody war which both sides later regretted At the beginning the elves fought only to defend themselves for they were reluctant to escalate the fighting but the dragons ferocity eventually forced them to attack for their own survival This lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer if an elf called Eragon hadnt found a dragon egg Eragon blinked in surprise Ah I see you didnt know of your namesake said Brom No The teakettle whistled stridentlyWhy was I named after an elf Then you should find this all the more interesting said Brom He hooked the kettle out of the fire and poured boiling water into two cups Handing one to Eragon he warned These leaves dont need to steep long so drink it quickly before it gets too strong Eragon tried a sip but scalded his tongue Brom set his own cup aside and continued smoking the pipe No one knows why that egg was abandoned Some say the parents were killed in an elven attack Others believe the dragons purposefully left it there Either way Eragon saw the value of raising a friendly dragon He cared for it secretly and in the custom of the ancient language named him BidDaum When BidDaum had grown to a good size they traveled together among the dragons and convinced them to live in peace with the elves Treaties were formed between the two races To ensure that war would never break out again they decided that it was necessary to establish the Riders At first the Riders were intended merely as a means of communication between the elves and dragons However as time passed their worth was recognized and they were given ever more authority Eventually they took the island Vroengard for their home and built a city on itDorú Areaba Before Galbatorix overthrew them the Riders held more power than all the kings in Alagaësia Now I believe I have answered two of your questions Yes said Eragon absently It seemed like an incredible coincidence that he had been named after the first Rider For some reason his name did not feel the same anymore What doesEragon mean I dont know said Brom Its very old I doubt anyone remembers except the elves and fortune would have to smile greatly before you talked with one It is a good name to have though you should be proud of it Not everyone has one so honorable Eragon brushed the matter from his mind and focused on what he had learned from Brom there was something missing I dont understand Where were we when the Riders were created We asked Brom raising an eyebrow You know all of us Eragon waved his hands vaguely Humans in general Brom laughed We are no more native to this land than the elves It took our ancestors another three centuries to arrive here and join the Riders That cant be protested Eragon Weve always lived in Palancar Valley That might be true for a few generations but beyond that no It isnt even true for you Eragon said Brom gently Though you consider yourself part of Garrows family and rightly so your sire was not from here Ask around and youll find many people who havent been here that long This valley is old and hasnt always belonged to us Eragon scowled and gulped at the tea It was still hot enough to burn his throat This was his home regardless of who his father was What happened to the dwarves after the Riders were destroyed No one really knows They fought with the Riders through the first few battles but when it became clear Galbatorix was going to win they sealed all the known entrances to their tunnels and disappeared underground As far as I know not one has been seen since And the dragons he asked What of them Surely they werent all killed Brom answered sorrowfully That is the greatest mystery in Alagaësia nowadays How many dragons survived Galbatorixs murderous slaughter He spared those who agreed to serve him but only the twisted dragons of the Forsworn would assist his madness If any dragons aside from Shruikan are still alive they have hidden themselves so they will never be found by the Empire So wheredidmy dragon come fromwondered Eragon Were the Urgals here when the elves came to Alagaësia he asked No they followed the elves across the sea like ticks seeking blood They were one of the reasons the Riders became valued for their battle prowess and ability to keep the peace Much can be learned from this history Its a pity the king makes it a delicate subject reflected Brom Yes I heard your story the last time I was in town Story roared Brom Lightning flashed in his eyes If it is a story then the rumors of my death are true and you are speaking with a ghost Respect the past you never know how it may affect you Eragon waited until Broms face mellowed before he dared ask How big were the dragons A dark plume of smoke swirled above Brom like a miniature thunderstorm Larger than a house Even the small ones had wingspans over a hundred feet they never stopped growing Some of the ancient ones before the Empire killed them could have passed for large hills Dismay swept through EragonHow can I hide my dragon in the years to come He raged silently but kept his voice calm When did they mature Well said Brom scratching his chin they couldnt breathe fire until they were around five to six months old which was about when they could mate The older a dragon was the longer it could breathe fire Some of them could keep at it for minutes Brom blew a smoke ring and watched it float up to the ceiling I heard that their scales shone like gems Brom leaned forward and growled You heard right They came in every color and shade It was said that a group of them looked like a living rainbow constantly shifting and shimmering But who told you that Eragon froze for a second then lied A trader What was his name asked Brom His tangled eyebrows met in a thick white line the wrinkles deepened on his forehead Unnoticed the pipe smoldered out Eragon pretended to think I dont know He was talking in Morns but I never found out who he was I wish you had muttered Brom He also said a Rider could hear his dragons thoughts said Eragon quickly hoping that the fictitious trader would protect him from suspicion Broms eyes narrowed Slowly he took out a tinderbox and struck the flint Smoke rose and he took a long pull from the pipe exhaling slowly In a flat voice he said He was wrong It isnt in any of the stories and I know them all Did he say anything else Eragon shrugged No Brom was too interested in the trader for him to continue the falsehood Casually he inquired Did dragons live very long Brom did not respond at once His chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe thoughtfully light reflecting off his ring Sorry my mind was elsewhere Yes a dragon will live for quite a while forever in fact as long as it isnt killed and its Rider doesnt die How does anyone know that objected Eragon If dragons die when their Riders do they could only live to be sixty or seventy You said during your narration that Riders lived for hundreds of years but thats impossible It troubled him to think of outliving his family and friends A quiet smile curled Broms lips as he said slyly What is possible is subjective Some would say that you can not travel through the Spine and live yet you do Its a matter of perspective You must be very wise to know so much at such a young age Eragon flushed and the old man chuckled Dont be angry you cant be expected to know such things You forget that the dragons were magicalthey affected everything around them in strange ways The Riders were closest to them and experienced this the most The most common side effect was an extended life Our king has lived long enough to make that apparent but most people attribute it to his own magical abilities There were also other less noticeable changes All the Riders were stronger of body keener of mind and truer of sight than normal men Along with this a human Rider would slowly acquire pointed ears though they were never as prominent as an elfs Eragon had to stop his hand from reaching up to feel the tips of his earsHow else will this dragon change my life Not only has it gotten inside my head but its altering my body as well Were dragons very smart Didnt you pay attention to what I told you earlier demanded Brom How could the elves form agreements and peace treaties with dumb brutes They were as intelligent as you or I But they were animals persisted Eragon Brom snorted They were no more animals than we are For some reason people praise everything the Riders did yet ignore the dragons assuming that they were nothing more than an exotic means to get from one town to another They werent The Riders great deeds were only possible because of the dragons How many men would draw their swords if they knew a giant firebreathing lizardone with more natural cunning and wisdom than even a king could hope forwould soon be there to stop the violence Hmm He blew another smoke ring and watched it waft away Did you ever see one Nay said Brom it was long before my time And now for a nameIve been trying to recall the name of a certain dragon but it keeps eluding me I think I heard it when the traders were in Carvahall but Im not sure Could you help me Brom shrugged and quickly listed a stream of names There was Jura Hírador and Fundorwho fought the giant sea snake Galzra Briam Ohen the Strong Gretiem Beroan Roslarb He added many others At the very end he uttered so softly Eragon almost did not hear and Saphira Brom quietly emptied his pipe Was it any of those Im afraid not said Eragon Brom had given him much to think about and it was getting late Well Rorans probably finished with Horst I should get back though Id rather not Brom raised an eyebrow What is that it I expected to be answering your questions until he came looking for you No queries about dragon battle tactics or requests for descriptions of breathtaking aerial combat Are we done For now laughed Eragon I learned what I wanted to and more He stood and Brom followed Very well then He ushered Eragon to the door Goodbye Take care And dont forget if you remember who that trader was tell me I will Thank you Eragon stepped into the glaring winter sunlight squinting He slowly paced away pondering what he had heard AN AME OFPOWER On the way home Roran said There was a stranger from Therinsford at Horsts today Whats his name asked Eragon He sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a brisk pace His cheeks and eyes burned from the cold Dempton He came here to have Horst forge him some sockets said Roran His stocky legs plowed through a drift clearing the way for Eragon Doesnt Therinsford have its own smith Yes replied Roran but he isnt skilled enough He glanced at Eragon With a shrug he added Dempton needs the sockets for his mill Hes expanding it and offered me a job If I accept Ill leave with him when he picks up the sockets Millers worked all year During winter they ground whatever people brought them but in harvest season they bought grain and sold it as flour It was hard dangerous work workers often lost fingers or hands to the giant millstones Are you going to tell Garrow asked Eragon Yes A grimly amused smile played across Rorans face What for You know what he thinks about us going away Itll only cause trouble if you say anything Forget about it so we can eat tonights dinner in peace I cant Im going to take the job Eragon halted Why They faced each other their breath visible in the air I know money is hard to come by but we always manage to survive You dont have to leave No I dont But the money is for myself Roran tried to resume walking but Eragon refused to budge What do you need it for he demanded Rorans shoulders straightened slightly I want to marry Bewilderment and astonishment overwhelmed Eragon He remembered seeing Katrina and Roran kissing during the traders visit but marriage Katrina he asked weakly just to confirm Roran nodded Have you asked her Not yet but come spring when I can raise a house I will Theres too much work on the farm for you to leave now protested Eragon Wait until were ready for planting No said Roran laughing slightly Springs the time Ill be needed the most The ground will have to be furrowed and sown The crops must be weedednot to mention all the other chores No this is the best time for me to go when all we really do is wait for the seasons to change You and Garrow can make do without me If all goes well Ill soon be back working on the farm with a wife Eragon reluctantly conceded that Roran made sense He shook his head but whether with amazement or anger he knew not I guess I can only wish you the best of luck But Garrow may take this with ill humor We will see They resumed walking the silence a barrier between them Eragons heart was disturbed It would take time before he could look upon this development with favor When they arrived home Roran did not tell Garrow of his plans but Eragon was sure that he soon would Eragon went to see the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him He approached apprehensively aware now that it was an equal Eragon Is that all you can say he snapped Yes His eyes widened at the unexpected reply and he sat down roughlyNow it has a sense of humor What next Impulsively he broke a dead branch with his foot Rorans announcement had put him in a foul mood A questioning thought came from the dragon so he told it what had happened As he talked his voice grew steadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air He ranted until his emotions were spent then ineffectually punched the ground I dont want him to go thats all he said helplessly The dragon watched impassively listening and learning Eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes He looked at the dragon thoughtfully You need a name I heard some interesting ones today perhaps youll like one He mentally ran through the list Brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic noble and pleasing to the ear What do you think of Vanilor or his successor Eridor Both were great dragons Nosaid the dragon It sounded amused with his effortsEragon Thatsmy name you cant have it he said rubbing his chin Well if you dont like those there are others He continued through the list but the dragon rejected every one he proposed It seemed to be laughing at something Eragon did not understand but he ignored it and kept suggesting names There was Ingothold he slew the A revelation stopped himThats the problem Ive been choosing male names You are a she YesThe dragon folded her wings smugly Now that he knew what to look for he came up with half a dozen names He toyed with Miremel but that did not fitafter all it was the name of a brown dragon Opheila and Lenora were also discarded He was about to give up when he remembered the last name Brom had muttered Eragon liked it but would the dragon He asked Are you Saphira She looked at him with intelligent eyes Deep in his mind he felt her satisfaction YesSomething clicked in his head and her voice echoed as if from a great distance He grinned in response Saphira started humming AM ILLERTOBE The sun had set by the time dinner was served A blustery wind howled outside shaking the house Eragon eyed Roran closely and waited for the inevitable Finally I was offered a job at Therinsfords mill which I plan to take Garrow finished his mouthful of food with deliberate slowness and laid down his fork He leaned back in his chair then interlaced his fingers behind his head and uttered one dry word Why Roran explained while Eragon absently picked at his food I see was Garrows only comment He fell silent and stared at the ceiling No one moved as they awaited his response Well when do you leave What asked Roran Garrow leaned forward with a twinkle in his eye Did you think I would stop you Id hoped you would marry soon It will be good to see this family growing again Katrina will be lucky to have you Astonishment raced over Rorans face then he settled into a relieved grin So when do you leave Garrow asked Roran regained his voice When Dempton returns to get the sockets for the mill Garrow nodded And that will be in Two weeks Good That will give us time to prepare Itll be different to have the house to ourselves But if nothing goes amiss it shouldnt be for too long He looked over the table and asked Eragon did you know of this He shrugged ruefully Not until today Its madness Garrow ran a hand over his face Its lifes natural course He pushed himself up from the chair All will be fine time will settle everything For now though lets clean the dishes Eragon and Roran helped him in silence The next few days were trying Eragons temper was frayed Except for curtly answering direct questions he spoke with no one There were small reminders everywhere that Roran was leaving Garrow making him a pack things missing from the walls and a strange emptiness that filled the house It was almost a week before he realized that distance had grown between Roran and him When they spoke the words did not come easily and their conversations were uncomfortable Saphira was a balm for Eragons frustration He could talk freely with her his emotions were completely open to her mind and she understood him better than anyone else During the weeks before Rorans departure she went through another growth spurt She gained twelve inches at the shoulder which was now higher than Eragons He found that the small hollow where her neck joined her shoulders was a perfect place to sit He often rested there in the evenings and scratched her neck while he explained the meanings of different words Soon she understood everything he said and frequently commented on it For Eragon this part of his life was delightful Saphira was as real and complex as any person Her personality was eclectic and at times completely alien yet they understood each other on a profound level Her actions and thoughts constantly revealed new aspects of her character Once she caught an eagle and instead of eating it released it sayingNo hunter of the sky should end his days as prey Better to die on the wing than pinned to the ground Eragons plan to let his family see Saphira was dispelled by Rorans announcement and Saphiras own cautionary words She was reluctant to be seen and he partly out of selfishness agreed The moment her existence was divulged he knew that shouts accusations and fear would be directed at him so he procrastinated He told himself to wait for a sign that it was the right time The night before Roran was to leave Eragon went to talk with him He stalked down the hallway to Rorans open door An oil lamp rested on a nightstand painting the walls with warm flickering light The bedposts cast elongated shadows on empty shelves that rose to the ceiling Roranhis eyes shaded and the back of his neck tensewas rolling blankets around his clothes and belongings He paused then picked up something from the pillow and bounced it in his hand It was a polished rock Eragon had given him years ago Roran started to tuck it into the bundle then stopped and set it on a shelf A hard lump formed in Eragons throat and he left S TRANGERS INCARVAHALL Breakfast was cold but the tea was hot Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning fire and soaked into the wood floor staining it with dark puddles Eragon looked at Garrow and Roran by the kitchen stove and reflected that this would be the last time he saw them together for many months Roran sat in a chair lacing his boots His full pack rested on the floor next to him Garrow stood between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets His shirt hung loosely his skin looked drawn Despite the young mens cajoling he refused to go with them When pressed for a reason he only said that it was for the best Do you have everything Garrow asked Roran Yes He nodded and took a small pouch from his pocket Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran Ive been saving this for you It isnt much but if you wish to buy some bauble or trinket it will suffice Thank you but I wont be spending my money on trifles said Roran Do what you will it is yours said Garrow Ive nothing else to give you except a fathers blessing Take it if you wish but it is worth little Rorans voice was thick with emotion I would be honored to receive it Then do and go in peace said Garrow and kissed him on the forehead He turned and said in a louder voice Do not think that I have forgotten you Eragon I have words for both of you Its time I said them as you are entering the world Heed them and they will serve you well He bent his gaze sternly on them First let no one rule your mind or body Take special care that your thoughts remain unfettered One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave Give men your ear but not your heart Show respect for those in power but dont follow them blindly Judge with logic and reason but comment not Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life Treat all fairly or they will seek revenge Be careful with your money Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen He continued at a slower pace Of the affairs of love my only advice is to be honest Thats your most powerful tool to unlock a heart or gain forgiveness That is all I have to say He seemed slightly selfconscious of his speech He hoisted Rorans pack Now you must go Dawn is approaching and Dempton will be waiting Roran shouldered the pack and hugged Garrow I will return as soon as I can he said Good replied Garrow But now go and dont worry about us They parted reluctantly Eragon and Roran went outside then turned and waved Garrow raised a bony hand his eyes grave and watched as they trudged to the road After a long moment he shut the door As the sound carried through the morning air Roran halted Eragon looked back and surveyed the land His eyes lingered on the lone buildings They looked pitifully small and fragile A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the house was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited There is our whole world Roran observed somberly Eragon shivered impatiently and grumbled A good one too Roran nodded then straightened his shoulders and headed into his new future The house disappeared from view as they descended the hill It was still early when they reached Carvahall but they found the smithy doors already open The air inside was pleasantly warm Baldor slowly worked two large bellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals Before the forge stood a black anvil and an ironbound barrel filled with brine From a line of neckhigh poles protruding from the walls hung rows of items giant tongs pliers hammers in every shape and weight chisels angles center punches files rasps lathes bars of iron and steel waiting to be shaped vises shears picks and shovels Horst and Dempton stood next to a long table Dempton approached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache Roran Im glad you came Theres going to be more work than I can handle with my new grindstones Are you ready to go Roran hefted his pack Yes Do we leave soon Ive a few things to take care of first but well be off within the hour Eragon shifted his feet as Dempton turned to him tugging at the corner of his mustache You must be Eragon I would offer you a job too but Roran got the only one Maybe in a year or two eh Eragon smiled uneasily and shook his hand The man was friendly Under other circumstances Eragon would have liked him but right then he sourly wished that the miller had never come to Carvahall Dempton huffed Good very good He returned his attention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked Theyre ready to go interrupted Horst gesturing at the table where several bundles rested You can take them whenever you want to They shook hands then Horst left the smithy beckoning to Eragon on the way out Interested Eragon followed He found the smith standing in the street with his arms crossed Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked What do you think of him Horst rumbled A good man Hell do fine with Roran He absently brushed metal filings off his apron then put a massive hand on Eragons shoulder Lad do you remember the fight you had with Sloan If youre asking about payment for the meat I havent forgotten No I trust you lad What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone Eragons heart flutteredWhy does he want to know Maybe someone saw Saphira Struggling not to panic he said I do but why do you ask As soon as you return home get rid of it Horst overrode Eragons exclamation Two men arrived here yesterday Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords It made my skin crawl just to look at them Last evening they started asking people if a stone like yours had been found Theyre at it again today Eragon blanched No one with any sense said anything They know trouble when they see it but I could name a few people who will talk Dread filled Eragons heart Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked it down Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira He did not know which would be worseThink Think The egg is gone Its impossible for them to find it now But if they know what it was itll be obvious what happened Saphira might be in danger It took all of his selfcontrol to retain a casual air Thanks for telling me Do you know where they are He was proud that his voice barely trembled I didnt warn you because I thought you needed to meet those men Leave Carvahall Go home All right said Eragon to placate the smith if you think I should I do Horsts face softened I may be overreacting but these strangers give me a bad feeling It would be better if you stay home until they leave Ill try to keep them away from your farm though it may not do any good Eragon looked at him gratefully He wished he could tell him about Saphira Ill leave now he said and hurried back to Roran Eragon clasped his cousins arm and bade him farewell Arent you going to stay awhile Roran asked with surprise Eragon almost laughed For some reason the question struck him as funny Theres nothing for me to do and Im not going to stand around until you go Well said Roran doubtfully I guess this is the last time well see each other for a few months Im sure it wont seem that long said Eragon hastily Take care and come back soon He hugged Roran then left Horst was still in the street Aware that the smith was watching Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall Once the smithy was out of sight he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village Eragon kept to the shadows as he searched each street listening for the slightest noise His thoughts flashed to his room where his bow hung he wished that it was in his hand He prowled across Carvahall avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant voice from around a house Although his ears were keen he had to strain to hear what was being said When did this happen The words were smooth like oiled glass and seemed to worm their way through the air Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp prickle About three months ago someone else answered Eragon identified him as Sloan Shades blood hes telling them He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met A third person spoke The voice was deep and moist It conjured up images of creeping decay mold and other things best left untouched Are you sure We would hate to think you had made a mistake If that were so it would be most unpleasant Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do Would anyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that Probably not but whoever sent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity Yeah Im sure He had it then Im not lying Plenty of people know about it Go ask them Sloan sounded shaken He said something else that Eragon did not catch They have been rather uncooperative The words were derisive There was a pause Your information has been helpful We will not forget you Eragon believed him Sloan muttered something then Eragon heard someone hurrying away He peered around the corner to see what was happening Two tall men stood in the street Both were dressed in long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs On their shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread Hoods shaded their faces and their hands were covered by gloves Their backs were oddly humped as though their clothes were stuffed with padding Eragon shifted slightly to get a better view One of the strangers stiffened and grunted peculiarly to his companion They both swiveled around and sank into crouches Eragons breath caught Mortal fear clenched him His eyes locked onto their hidden faces and a stifling power fell over his mind keeping him in place He struggled against it and screamed to himselfMove His legs swayed but to no avail The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth noiseless gait He knew they could see his face now They were almost to the corner hands grasping at swords Eragon He jerked as his name was called The strangers froze in place and hissed Brom hurried toward him from the side head bare and staff in hand The strangers were blocked from the old mans view Eragon tried to warn him but his tongue and arms would not stir Eragon cried Brom again The strangers gave Eragon one last look then slipped away between the houses Eragon collapsed to the ground shivering Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms sticky The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm You look sick is all well Eragon gulped and nodded mutely His eyes flickered around searching for anything unusual I just got dizzy all of a sudden its passed It was very oddI dont know why it happened Youll recover said Brom but perhaps it would be better if you went home Yes I have to get home Have to get there before they doI think youre right Maybe Im getting ill Then home is the best place for you Its a long walk but Im sure you will feel better by the time you arrive Let me escort you to the road Eragon did not protest as Brom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace Broms staff crunched in the snow as they passed the houses Why were you looking for me Brom shrugged Simple curiosity I learned you were in town and wondered if you had remembered the name of that trader Trader Whats he talking aboutEragon stared blankly his confusion caught the attention of Broms probing eyes No he said and then amended himself Im afraid I still dont remember Brom sighed gruffly as if something had been confirmed and rubbed his eagle nose Well then if you do come tell me I am most interested in this trader who pretends to know so much about dragons Eragon nodded with a distracted air They walked in silence to the road then Brom said Hasten home I dont think it would be a good idea to tarry on the way He offered a gnarled hand Eragon shook it but as he let go something in Broms hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off It fell to the ground The old man picked it up Clumsy of me he apologized and handed it back As Eragon took the mitt Broms strong fingers wrapped around his wrist and twisted sharply His palm briefly faced upward revealing the silvery mark Broms eyes glinted but he let Eragon yank his hand back and jam it into the mitt Goodbye Eragon forced out perturbed and hurried down the road Behind him he heard Brom whistling a merry tune STRANGERS INCARVAHALL Breakfast was cold but the tea was hot Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning fire and soaked into the wood floor staining it with dark puddles Eragon looked at Garrow and Roran by the kitchen stove and reflected that this would be the last time he saw them together for many months Roran sat in a chair lacing his boots His full pack rested on the floor next to him Garrow stood between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets His shirt hung loosely his skin looked drawn Despite the young mens cajoling he refused to go with them When pressed for a reason he only said that it was for the best Do you have everything Garrow asked Roran Yes He nodded and took a small pouch from his pocket Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran Ive been saving this for you It isnt much but if you wish to buy some bauble or trinket it will suffice Thank you but I wont be spending my money on trifles said Roran Do what you will it is yours said Garrow Ive nothing else to give you except a fathers blessing Take it if you wish but it is worth little Rorans voice was thick with emotion I would be honored to receive it Then do and go in peace said Garrow and kissed him on the forehead He turned and said in a louder voice Do not think that I have forgotten you Eragon I have words for both of you Its time I said them as you are entering the world Heed them and they will serve you well He bent his gaze sternly on them First let no one rule your mind or body Take special care that your thoughts remain unfettered One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave Give men your ear but not your heart Show respect for those in power but dont follow them blindly Judge with logic and reason but comment not Consider none your superior whatever their rank or station in life Treat all fairly or they will seek revenge Be careful with your money Hold fast to your beliefs and others will listen He continued at a slower pace Of the affairs of love my only advice is to be honest Thats your most powerful tool to unlock a heart or gain forgiveness That is all I have to say He seemed slightly selfconscious of his speech He hoisted Rorans pack Now you must go Dawn is approaching and Dempton will be waiting Roran shouldered the pack and hugged Garrow I will return as soon as I can he said Good replied Garrow But now go and dont worry about us They parted reluctantly Eragon and Roran went outside then turned and waved Garrow raised a bony hand his eyes grave and watched as they trudged to the road After a long moment he shut the door As the sound carried through the morning air Roran halted Eragon looked back and surveyed the land His eyes lingered on the lone buildings They looked pitifully small and fragile A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the house was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited There is our whole world Roran observed somberly Eragon shivered impatiently and grumbled A good one too Roran nodded then straightened his shoulders and headed into his new future The house disappeared from view as they descended the hill It was still early when they reached Carvahall but they found the smithy doors already open The air inside was pleasantly warm Baldor slowly worked two large bellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals Before the forge stood a black anvil and an ironbound barrel filled with brine From a line of neckhigh poles protruding from the walls hung rows of items giant tongs pliers hammers in every shape and weight chisels angles center punches files rasps lathes bars of iron and steel waiting to be shaped vises shears picks and shovels Horst and Dempton stood next to a long table Dempton approached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache Roran Im glad you came Theres going to be more work than I can handle with my new grindstones Are you ready to go Roran hefted his pack Yes Do we leave soon Ive a few things to take care of first but well be off within the hour Eragon shifted his feet as Dempton turned to him tugging at the corner of his mustache You must be Eragon I would offer you a job too but Roran got the only one Maybe in a year or two eh Eragon smiled uneasily and shook his hand The man was friendly Under other circumstances Eragon would have liked him but right then he sourly wished that the miller had never come to Carvahall Dempton huffed Good very good He returned his attention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked Theyre ready to go interrupted Horst gesturing at the table where several bundles rested You can take them whenever you want to They shook hands then Horst left the smithy beckoning to Eragon on the way out Interested Eragon followed He found the smith standing in the street with his arms crossed Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked What do you think of him Horst rumbled A good man Hell do fine with Roran He absently brushed metal filings off his apron then put a massive hand on Eragons shoulder Lad do you remember the fight you had with Sloan If youre asking about payment for the meat I havent forgotten No I trust you lad What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone Eragons heart flutteredWhy does he want to know Maybe someone saw Saphira Struggling not to panic he said I do but why do you ask As soon as you return home get rid of it Horst overrode Eragons exclamation Two men arrived here yesterday Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords It made my skin crawl just to look at them Last evening they started asking people if a stone like yours had been found Theyre at it again today Eragon blanched No one with any sense said anything They know trouble when they see it but I could name a few people who will talk Dread filled Eragons heart Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked it down Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira He did not know which would be worseThink Think The egg is gone Its impossible for them to find it now But if they know what it was itll be obvious what happened Saphira might be in danger It took all of his selfcontrol to retain a casual air Thanks for telling me Do you know where they are He was proud that his voice barely trembled I didnt warn you because I thought you needed to meet those men Leave Carvahall Go home All right said Eragon to placate the smith if you think I should I do Horsts face softened I may be overreacting but these strangers give me a bad feeling It would be better if you stay home until they leave Ill try to keep them away from your farm though it may not do any good Eragon looked at him gratefully He wished he could tell him about Saphira Ill leave now he said and hurried back to Roran Eragon clasped his cousins arm and bade him farewell Arent you going to stay awhile Roran asked with surprise Eragon almost laughed For some reason the question struck him as funny Theres nothing for me to do and Im not going to stand around until you go Well said Roran doubtfully I guess this is the last time well see each other for a few months Im sure it wont seem that long said Eragon hastily Take care and come back soon He hugged Roran then left Horst was still in the street Aware that the smith was watching Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall Once the smithy was out of sight he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village Eragon kept to the shadows as he searched each street listening for the slightest noise His thoughts flashed to his room where his bow hung he wished that it was in his hand He prowled across Carvahall avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant voice from around a house Although his ears were keen he had to strain to hear what was being said When did this happen The words were smooth like oiled glass and seemed to worm their way through the air Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp prickle About three months ago someone else answered Eragon identified him as Sloan Shades blood hes telling them He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met A third person spoke The voice was deep and moist It conjured up images of creeping decay mold and other things best left untouched Are you sure We would hate to think you had made a mistake If that were so it would be most unpleasant Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do Would anyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that Probably not but whoever sent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity Yeah Im sure He had it then Im not lying Plenty of people know about it Go ask them Sloan sounded shaken He said something else that Eragon did not catch They have been rather uncooperative The words were derisive There was a pause Your information has been helpful We will not forget you Eragon believed him Sloan muttered something then Eragon heard someone hurrying away He peered around the corner to see what was happening Two tall men stood in the street Both were dressed in long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs On their shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread Hoods shaded their faces and their hands were covered by gloves Their backs were oddly humped as though their clothes were stuffed with padding Eragon shifted slightly to get a better view One of the strangers stiffened and grunted peculiarly to his companion They both swiveled around and sank into crouches Eragons breath caught Mortal fear clenched him His eyes locked onto their hidden faces and a stifling power fell over his mind keeping him in place He struggled against it and screamed to himselfMove His legs swayed but to no avail The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth noiseless gait He knew they could see his face now They were almost to the corner hands grasping at swords Eragon He jerked as his name was called The strangers froze in place and hissed Brom hurried toward him from the side head bare and staff in hand The strangers were blocked from the old mans view Eragon tried to warn him but his tongue and arms would not stir Eragon cried Brom again The strangers gave Eragon one last look then slipped away between the houses Eragon collapsed to the ground shivering Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms sticky The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm You look sick is all well Eragon gulped and nodded mutely His eyes flickered around searching for anything unusual I just got dizzy all of a sudden its passed It was very oddI dont know why it happened Youll recover said Brom but perhaps it would be better if you went home Yes I have to get home Have to get there before they doI think youre right Maybe Im getting ill Then home is the best place for you Its a long walk but Im sure you will feel better by the time you arrive Let me escort you to the road Eragon did not protest as Brom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace Broms staff crunched in the snow as they passed the houses Why were you looking for me Brom

Broms eyes glinted but he let Eragon yank his hand back and jam it into the mitt Goodbye Eragon forced out perturbed and hurried down the road Behind him he heard Brom whistling a merry tune F LIGHT OFDESTINY Eragons mind churned as he sped on his way He ran as fast as he could refusing to stop even when his breath came in great gasps As he pounded down the cold road he cast out with his mind for Saphira but she was too far away for him to contact He thought about what to say to Garrow There was no choice now he would have to reveal Saphira He arrived home panting for air and heart pounding Garrow stood by the barn with the horses Eragon hesitated Should I talk to him now He wont believe me unless Saphira is hereId better find her firstHe slipped around the farm and into the forestSaphira he shouted with his thoughts I comewas the dim reply Through the words he sensed her alarm He waited impatiently though it was not long before the sound of her wings filled the air She landed amid a gout of smokeWhat happened she queried He touched her shoulder and closed his eyes Calming his mind he quickly told her what had occurred When he mentioned the strangers Saphira recoiled She reared and roared deafeningly then whipped her tail over his head He scrambled back in surprise ducking as her tail hit a snowdrift Bloodlust and fear emanated from her in great sickening wavesFire Enemies Death Murderers Whats wrongHe put all of his strength into the words but an iron wall surrounded her mind shielding her thoughts She let out another roar and gouged the earth with her claws tearing the frozen groundStop it Garrow will hear Oaths betrayed souls killed eggs shattered Blood everywhere Murderers Frantic he blocked out Saphiras emotions and watched her tail When it flicked past him he dashed to her side and grabbed a spike on her back Clutching it he pulled himself into the small hollow at the base of her neck and held on tightly as she reared again Enough Saphira he bellowed Her stream of thoughts ceased abruptly He ran a hand over her scales Everythings going to be all right She crouched and her wings rushed upward They hung there for an instant then drove down as she flung herself into the sky Eragon yelled as the ground dropped away and they rose above the trees Turbulence buffeted him snatching the breath out of his mouth Saphira ignored his terror and banked toward the Spine Underneath he glimpsed the farm and the Anora River His stomach convulsed He tightened his arms around Saphiras neck and concentrated on the scales in front of his nose trying not to vomit as she continued to climb When she leveled off he gained the courage to glance around The air was so cold that frost accumulated on his eyelashes They had reached the mountains faster than he thought possible From the air the peaks looked like giant razorsharp teeth waiting to slash them to ribbons Saphira wobbled unexpectedly and Eragon heaved over her side He wiped his lips tasting bile and buried his head against her neck We have to go backhe pleadedThe strangers are coming to the farmGarrow has to be warned Turn around There was no answer He reached for her mind but was blocked by a barrier of roiling fear and anger Determined to make her turn around he grimly wormed into her mental armor He pushed at its weak places undermined the stronger sections and fought to make her listen but to no avail Soon mountains surrounded them forming tremendous white walls broken by granite cliffs Blue glaciers sat between the summits like frozen rivers Long valleys and ravines opened beneath them He heard the dismayed screech of birds far below as Saphira soared into view He saw a herd of woolly goats bounding from ledge to ledge on a rocky bluff Eragon was battered by swirling gusts from Saphiras wings and whenever she moved her neck he was tossed from side to side She seemed tireless He was afraid she was going to fly through the night Finally as darkness fell she tilted into a shallow dive He looked ahead and saw that they were headed for a small clearing in a valley Saphira spiraled down leisurely drifting over the treetops She pulled back as the ground neared filled her wings with air and landed on her rear legs Her powerful muscles rippled as they absorbed the shock of impact She dropped to all fours and skipped a step to keep her balance Eragon slid off without waiting for her to fold her wings As he struck the ground his knees buckled and his cheek slammed against the snow He gasped as excruciating pain seared through his legs sending tears to his eyes His muscles cramped from clenching for so long shook violently He rolled onto his back shivering and stretched his limbs as best he could Then he forced himself to look down Two large blots darkened his wool pants on the insides of his thighs He touched the fabric It was wet Alarmed he peeled off the pants and grimaced The insides of his legs were raw and bloody The skin was gone rubbed off by Saphiras hard scales He gingerly felt the abrasions and winced Cold bit into him as he pulled the pants back on and he cried out as they scraped against the sensitive wounds He tried to stand but his legs would not support him The deepening night obscured his surroundings the shaded mountains were unfamiliar Im in the Spine I dont know where during the middle of winter with a crazed dragon unable to walk or find shelter Night is falling I have to get back to the farm tomorrow And the only way to do that is to fly which I cant endure anymoreHe took a deep breathOh I wish Saphira could breathe fire He turned his head and saw her next to him crouched low to the ground He put a hand on her side and found it trembling The barrier in her mind was gone Without it her fear scorched through him He clamped down on it and slowly soothed her with gentle imagesWhy do the strangers frighten you Murderers she hissed Garrow is in danger and you kidnap me on this ridiculous journey Are you unable to protect meShe growled deeply and snapped her jawsAh but if you think you can why run Death is a poison He leaned on one elbow and stifled his frustrationSaphira look where we are The sun is down and your flight has stripped my legs as easily as I would scale a fish Is that what you wanted No Then why did you do ithe demanded Through his link with Saphira he felt her regret for his pain but not for her actions She looked away and refused to answer The icy temperature deadened Eragons legs although it lessened the pain he knew that his condition was not good He changed tackIm going to freeze unless you make me a shelter or hollow so I can stay warm Even a pile of pine needles and branches would do She seemed relieved that he had stopped interrogating herThere is no need I will curl around you and cover you with my wingsthe fire inside me will stay the cold Eragon let his head thump back on the groundFine but scrape the snow off the ground Itll be more comfortable In answer Saphira razed a drift with her tail clearing it with one powerful stroke She swept over the site again to remove the last few inches of hardened snow He eyed the exposed dirt with distasteI cant walk over there Youll have to help me to it Her head larger than his torso swung over him and came to rest by his side He stared at her large sapphirecolored eyes and wrapped his hands around one of her ivory spikes She lifted her head and slowly dragged him to the bare spotGently gently Stars danced in his eyes as he slid over a rock but he managed to hold on After he let go Saphira rolled on her side exposing her warm belly He huddled against the smooth scales of her underside Her right wing extended over him and enclosed him in complete darkness forming a living tent Almost immediately the air began to lose its frigidity He pulled his arms inside his coat and tied the empty sleeves around his neck For the first time he noticed that hunger gnawed at his stomach But it did not distract him from his main worry Could he get back to the farm before the strangers did And if not what would happenEven if I can force myself to ride Saphira again itll be at least midafternoon before we get back The strangers could be there long before that He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slide down his faceWhat have I done T HEDOOM OFINNOCENCE When Eragon opened his eyes in the morning he thought the sky had fallen An unbroken plane of blue stretched over his head and slanted to the ground Still half asleep he reached out tentatively and felt a thin membrane under his fingers It took him a long minute to realize what he was staring at He bent his neck slightly and glared at the scaly haunch his head rested on Slowly he pushed his legs out from his fetal curl scabs cracking The pain had subsided some from yesterday but he shrank from the thought of walking Burning hunger reminded him of his missed meals He summoned the energy to move and pounded weakly on Saphiras side Hey Wake up he yelled She stirred and lifted her wing to admit a torrent of sunshine He squinted as the snow momentarily blinded him Beside him Saphira stretched like a cat and yawned flashing rows of white teeth When Eragons eyes adjusted he examined where they were Imposing and unfamiliar mountains surrounded them casting deep shadows on the clearing Off to one side he saw a trail cut through the snow and into the forest where he could hear the muffled gurgling of a creek Groaning he stood and swayed then stiffly hobbled to a tree He grabbed one of its branches and threw his weight against it It held then broke with a loud crack He ripped off the twigs fit one end of the branch under his arm and planted the other firmly in the ground With the help of his improvised crutch he limped to the icedover creek He broke through the hard shell and cupped the clear bitter water Sated he returned to the clearing As he emerged from the trees he finally recognized the mountains and the lay of the land This was where amid deafening sound Saphiras egg had first appeared He sagged against a rough trunk There could be no mistake for now he saw the gray trees that had been stripped of their needles in the explosionHow did Saphira know where this was She was still in the egg My memories must have given her enough information to find it He shook his head in silent astonishment Saphira was waiting patiently for himWill you take me home he asked her She cocked her headI know you dont want to but you must Both of us carry an obligation to Garrow He has cared for me and through me you Would you ignore that debt What will be said of us in years to come if we dont returnthat we hid like cowards while my uncle was in danger I can hear it now the story of the Rider and his craven dragon If there will be a fight lets face it and not shy away You are a dragon Even a Shade would run from you Yet you crouch in the mountains like a frightened rabbit Eragon meant to anger her and he succeeded A growl rippled in her throat as her head jabbed within a few inches of his face She bared her fangs and glared at him smoke trailing from her nostrils He hoped that he had not gone too far Her thoughts reached him red with angerBlood will meet blood I will fight Our wyrdsour fatesbind us but try me not I will take you because of debt owed but into foolishness we fly Foolishness or not he said into the air there is no choicewe must go He ripped his shirt in half and stuffed a piece into each side of his pants Gingerly he hoisted himself onto Saphira and took a tight hold on her neckThis time he told herfly lower and faster Time is of the essence Dont let goshe cautioned then surged into the sky They rose above the forest and leveled out immediately barely staying above the branches Eragons stomach lurched he was glad it was empty Faster fasterhe urged She said nothing but the beat of her wings increased He screwed his eyes shut and hunched his shoulders He had hoped that the extra padding of his shirt would protect him but every movement sent pangs through his legs Soon lines of hot blood trickled down his calves Concern emanated from Saphira She went even faster now her wings straining The land sped past as if it were being pulled out from under them Eragon imagined that to someone on the ground they were just a blur By early afternoon Palancar Valley lay before them Clouds obscured his vision to the south Carvahall was to the north Saphira glided down while Eragon searched for the farm When he spotted it fear jolted him A black plume with orange flames dancing at its base rose from the farm SaphiraHe pointedGet me down there Now She locked her wings and tilted into a steep dive hurtling groundward at a frightening rate Then she altered her dive slightly so they sped toward the forest He yelled over the screaming air Land in the fields He held on tighter as they plummeted Saphira waited until they were only a hundred feet off the ground before driving her wings downward in several powerful strokes She landed heavily breaking his grip He crashed to the ground then staggered upright gasping for breath The house had been blasted apart Timbers and boards that had been walls and roof were strewn across a wide area The wood was pulverized as if a giant hammer had smashed it Sooty shingles lay everywhere A few twisted metal plates were all that remained of the stove The snow was perforated with smashed white crockery and chunks of bricks from the chimney Thick oily smoke billowed from the barn which burned fiercely The farm animals were gone either killed or frightened away Uncle Eragon ran to the wreckage hunting through the destroyed rooms for Garrow There was no sign of him Uncle Eragon cried again Saphira walked around the house and came to his side Sorrow breeds hereshe said This wouldnt have happened if you hadnt run away with me You would not be alive if we had stayed Look at this he screamed We couldve warned Garrow Its your fault he didnt get away He slammed his fist against a pole splitting the skin on his knuckles Blood dripped down his fingers as he stalked out of the house He stumbled to the path that led to the road and bent down to examine the snow Several tracks were before him but his vision was blurry and he could barely seeAm I going blind he wondered With a shaking hand he touched his cheeks and found them wet A shadow fell on him as Saphira loomed overhead sheltering him with her wingsTake comfort all may not be lost He looked up at her searching for hopeExamine the trail my eyes see only two sets of prints Garrow could not have been taken from here He focused on the trampled snow The faint imprints of two pairs of leather boots headed toward the house On top of those were traces of the same two sets of boots leaving And whoever had made the departing tracks had been carrying the same weight as when they arrivedYoure right Garrow has to be here He leapt to his feet and hurried back to the house I will search around the buildings and in the forestsaid Saphira Eragon scrambled into the remains of the kitchen and frantically started digging through a pile of rubble Pieces of debris that he could not have moved normally now seemed to shift on their own accord A cupboard mostly intact stymied him for a second then he heaved and sent it flying As he pulled on a board something rattled behind him He spun around ready for an attack A hand extended from under a section of collapsed roof It moved weakly and he grasped it with a cry Uncle can you hear me There was no response Eragon tore at pieces of wood heedless of the splinters that pierced his hands He quickly exposed an arm and shoulder but was barred by a heavy beam He threw his shoulder at it and shoved with every fiber of his being but it defied his efforts Saphira I need you She came immediately Wood cracked under her feet as she crawled over the ruined walls Without a word she nosed past him and set her side against the beam Her claws sank into what was left of the floor her muscles strained With a grating sound the beam lifted and Eragon rushed under it Garrow lay on his stomach his clothes mostly torn off Eragon pulled him out of the rubble As soon as they were clear Saphira released the beam leaving it to crash to the floor Eragon dragged Garrow out of the destroyed house and eased him to the ground Dismayed he touched his uncle gently His skin was gray lifeless and dry as if a fever had burned off any sweat His lip was split and there was a long scrape on his cheekbone but that was not the worst Deep ragged burns covered most of his body They were chalky white and oozed clear liquid A cloying sickening smell hung over himthe odor of rotting fruit His breath came in short jerks each one sounding like a death rattle Murderershissed Saphira Dont say that He can still be saved We have to get him to Gertrude I cant carry him to Carvahall though Saphira presented an image of Garrow hanging under her while she flew Can you lift both of us I must Eragon dug through the rubble until he found a board and leather thongs He had Saphira pierce a hole with a claw at each of the boards corners then he looped a piece of leather through each hole and tied them to her forelegs After checking to make sure the knots were secure he rolled Garrow onto the board and lashed him down As he did a scrap of black cloth fell from his uncles hand It matched the strangers clothing He angrily stuffed it in a pocket mounted Saphira and closed his eyes as his body settled into a steady throb of painNow She leapt up hind legs digging into the ground Her wings clawed at the air as she slowly climbed Tendons strained and popped as she battled gravity For a long painful second nothing happened but then she lunged forward powerfully and they rose higher Once they were over the forest Eragon told herFollow the road Itll give you enough room if you have to land I might be seen It doesnt matter anymoreShe argued no further as she veered to the road and headed for Carvahall Garrow swung wildly underneath them only the slender leather cords kept him from falling The extra weight slowed Saphira Before long her head sagged and there was froth at her mouth She struggled to continue yet they were almost a league from Carvahall when she locked her wings and sank toward the road Her hind feet touched with a shower of snow Eragon tumbled off her landing heavily on his side to avoid hurting his legs He struggled to his feet and worked to untie the leather from Saphiras legs Her thick panting filled the airFind a safe place to rest he saidI dont know how long Ill be gone so youre going to have to take care of yourself for a while I will waitshe said He gritted his teeth and began to drag Garrow down the road The first few steps sent an explosion of agony through him I cant do this he howled at the sky then took a few more steps His mouth locked into a snarl He stared at the ground between his feet as he forced himself to hold a steady pace It was a fight against his unruly bodya fight he refused to lose The minutes crawled by at an excruciating rate Each yard he covered seemed many times that With desperation he wondered if Carvahall still existed or if the strangers had burnt it down too After a time through a haze of pain he heard shouting and looked up Brom was running toward himeyes large hair awry and one side of his head caked with dried blood He waved his arms wildly before dropping his staff and grabbing Eragons shoulders saying something in a loud voice Eragon blinked uncomprehendingly Without warning the ground rushed up to meet him He tasted blood then blacked out D EATHWATCH Dreams roiled in Eragons mind breeding and living by their own lawsHe watched as a group of people on proud horses approached a lonely river Many had silver hair and carried tall lances A strange fair ship waited for them shining under a bright moon The figures slowly boarded the vessel two of them taller than the rest walked arm in arm Their faces were obscured by cowls but he could tell that one was a woman They stood on the deck of the ship and faced the shore A man stood alone on the pebble beach the only one who had not boarded the ship He threw back his head and let out a long aching cry As it faded the ship glided down the river without a breeze or oars out into the flat empty land The vision clouded but just before it disappeared Eragon glimpsed two dragons in the sky Eragon was first aware of the creaking back and forth back and forth The persistent sound made him open his eyes and stare at the underside of a thatched roof A rough blanket was draped over him concealing his nakedness Someone had bandaged his legs and tied a clean rag around his knuckles He was in a singleroom hut A mortar and pestle sat on a table with bowls and plants Rows of dried herbs hung from the walls and suffused the air with strong earthy aromas Flames writhed inside a fireplace before which sat a rotund woman in a wicker rocking chairthe town healer Gertrude Her head lolled eyes closed A pair of knitting needles and a ball of wool thread rested in her lap Though Eragon felt drained of willpower he made himself sit up That helped to clear his mind He sifted through his memories of the last two days His first thought was of Garrow and his second was of SaphiraI hope shes in a safe place He tried to contact her but could not Wherever she was it was far from CarvahallAt least Brom got me to Carvahall I wonder what happened to him There was all that blood Gertrude stirred and opened her sparkling eyes Oh she said Youre awake Good Her voice was rich and warm How do you feel Well enough Wheres Garrow Gertrude dragged the chair close to the bed Over at Horsts There wasnt enough room to keep both of you here And let me tell you its kept me on my toes having to run back and forth checking to see if the two of you were all right Eragon swallowed his worries and asked How is he There was a long delay as she examined her hands Not good He has a fever that refuses to break and his injuries arent healing I have to see him He tried to get up Not until you eat she said sharply pushing him down I didnt spend all this time sitting by your side so you can get back up and hurt yourself Half the skin on your legs was torn off and your fever broke only last night Dont worry yourself about Garrow Hell be fine Hes a tough man Gertrude hung a kettle over the fire then began chopping parsnips for soup How long have I been here Two full days Two daysThat meant his last meal had been four mornings ago Just thinking about it made Eragon feel weakSaphiras been on her own this entire time I hope shes all right The whole town wants to know what happened They sent men down to your farm and found it destroyed Eragon nodded he had expected that Your barn was burned down Is that how Garrow was injured I I dont know said Eragon I wasnt there when it happened Well no matter Im sure itll all get untangled Gertrude resumed knitting while the soup cooked Thats quite a scar on your palm He reflexively clenched his hand Yes How did you get it Several possible answers came to mind He chose the simplest one Ive had it ever since I can remember I never asked Garrow where it came from Mmm The silence remained unbroken until the soup reached a rolling boil Gertrude poured it in a bowl and handed it to Eragon with a spoon He accepted it gratefully and took a cautious sip It was delicious When he finished he asked Can I visit Garrow now Gertrude sighed Youre a determined one arent you Well if you really want to I wont stop you Put on your clothes and well go She turned her back as he struggled into his pants wincing as they dragged over the bandages and then slipped on his shirt Gertrude helped him stand His legs were weak but they did not pain him like before Take a few steps she commanded then dryly observed At least you wont have to crawl there Outside a blustery wind blew smoke from the adjacent buildings into their faces Storm clouds hid the Spine and covered the valley while a curtain of snow advanced toward the village obscuring the foothills Eragon leaned heavily on Gertrude as they made their way through Carvahall Horst had built his twostory house on a hill so he could enjoy a view of the mountains He had lavished all of his skill on it The shale roof shadowed a railed balcony that extended from a tall window on the second floor Each water spout was a snarling gargoyle and every window and door was framed by carvings of serpents harts ravens and knotted vines The door was opened by Elain Horsts wife a small willowy woman with refined features and silky blond hair pinned into a bun Her dress was demure and neat and her movements graceful Please come in she said softly They stepped over the threshold into a large welllit room A staircase with a polished balustrade curved down to the floor The walls were the color of honey Elain gave Eragon a sad smile but addressed Gertrude I was just about to send for you He isnt doing well You should see him right away Elain youll have to help Eragon up the stairs Gertrude said then hurried up them two at a time Its okay I can do it myself Are you sure asked Elain He nodded but she looked doubtful Well as soon as youre done come visit me in the kitchen I have a freshbaked pie you might enjoy As soon as she left he sagged against the wall welcoming the support Then he started up the stairs one painful step at a time When he reached the top he looked down a long hallway dotted with doors The last one was open slightly Taking a breath he lurched toward it Katrina stood by a fireplace boiling rags She looked up murmured a condolence and then returned to her work Gertrude stood beside her grinding herbs for a poultice A bucket by her feet held snow melting into ice water Garrow lay on a bed piled high with blankets Sweat covered his brow and his eyeballs flickered blindly under their lids The skin on his face was shrunken like a cadavers He was still save for subtle tremors from his shallow breathing Eragon touched his uncles forehead with a feeling of unreality It burned against his hand He apprehensively lifted the edge of the blankets and saw that Garrows many wounds were bound with strips of cloth Where the bandages were being changed the burns were exposed to the air They had not begun to heal Eragon looked at Gertrude with hopeless eyes Cant you do anything about these She pressed a rag into the bucket of ice water then draped the cool cloth over Garrows head Ive tried everything salves poultices tinctures but nothing works If the wounds closed he would have a better chance Still things may turn for the better Hes hardy and strong Eragon moved to a corner and sank to the floorThis isnt the way things are supposed to be Silence swallowed his thoughts He stared blankly at the bed After a while he noticed Katrina kneeling beside him She put an arm around him When he did not respond she diffidently left Sometime later the door opened and Horst came in He talked to Gertrude in a low voice then approached Eragon Come on You need to get out of here Before Eragon could protest Horst dragged him to his feet and shepherded him out the door I want to stay he complained You need a break and fresh air Dont worry you can go back soon enough consoled Horst Eragon grudgingly let the smith help him downstairs into the kitchen Heady smells from half a dozen dishesrich with spices and herbsfilled the air Albriech and Baldor were there talking with their mother as she kneaded bread The brothers fell silent as they saw Eragon but he had heard enough to know that they were discussing Garrow Here sit down said Horst offering a chair Eragon sank into it gratefully Thank you His hands were shaking slightly so he clasped them in his lap A plate piled high with food was set before him You dont have to eat said Elain but its there if you want She returned to her cooking as he picked up a fork He could barely swallow a few bites How do you feel asked Horst Terrible The smith waited a moment I know this isnt the best time but we need to know what happened I dont really remember Eragon said Horst leaning forward I was one of the people who went out to your farm Your house didnt just fall apartsomething tore it to pieces Surrounding it were tracks of a gigantic beast Ive never seen nor heard of before Others saw them too Now if theres a Shade or a monster roaming around we have to know Youre the only one who can tell us Eragon knew he had to lie When I left Carvahall he counted up the time four days ago there were strangers in town asking about a stone like the one I found He gestured at Horst You talked to me about them and because of that I hurried home All eyes were upon him He licked his lips Nothing nothing happened that night The next morning I finished my chores and went walking in the forest Before long I heard an explosion and saw smoke above the trees I rushed back as fast as I could but whoever did it was already gone I dug through the wreckage and found Garrow So then you put him on the plank and dragged him back asked Albriech Yes said Eragon but before I left I looked at the path to the road There were two pairs of tracks on it both of them mens He dug in his pocket and pulled out the scrap of black fabric This was clenched in Garrows hand I think it matches what those strangers were wearing He set it on the table It does said Horst He looked both thoughtful and angry And what of your legs How were they injured Im not sure said Eragon shaking his head I think it happened when I dug Garrow out but I dont know It wasnt until the blood started dripping down my legs that I noticed it Thats horrible exclaimed Elain We should pursue those men stated Albriech hotly They cant get away with this With a pair of horses we could catch them tomorrow and bring them back here Put that foolishness out of your head said Horst They could probably pick you up like a baby and throw you in a tree Remember what happened to the house We dont want to get in the way of those people Besides they have what they want now He looked at Eragon They did take the stone didnt they It wasnt in the house Then theres no reason for them to return now that they have it He gave Eragon a piercing look You didnt mention anything about those strange tracks Do you know where they came from Eragon shook his head I didnt see them Baldor abruptly spoke I dont like this Too much of this rings of wizardry Who are those men Are they Shades Why did they want the stone and how could they have destroyed the house except with dark powers You may be right Father the stone might be all they wanted but I think we will see them again Silence followed his words Something had been overlooked though Eragon was not sure what Then it struck him With a sinking heart he voiced his suspicion Roran doesnt know does heHow could I have forgotten him Horst shook his head He and Dempton left a little while after you Unless they ran into some difficulty on the road theyve been in Therinsford for a couple of days now We were going to send a message but the weather was too cold yesterday and the day before Baldor and I were about to leave when you woke up offered Albriech Horst ran a hand through his beard Go on both of you Ill help you saddle the horses Baldor turned to Eragon Ill break it to him gently he promised then followed Horst and Albriech out of the kitchen Eragon remained at the table his eyes focused on a knot in the wood Every excruciating detail was clear to him the twisting grain an asymmetrical bump three little ridges with a fleck of color The knot was filled with endless detail the closer he looked the more he saw He searched for answers in it but if there were any they eluded him A faint call broke through his pounding thoughts It sounded like yelling from outside He ignored itLet someone else deal with it Several minutes later he heard it again louder than before Angrily he blocked it outWhy cant they be quiet Garrows resting He glanced at Elain but she did not seem to be bothered by the noise ERAGONThe roar was so strong he almost fell out of the chair He peered around in alarm but nothing had changed He suddenly realized that the shouts had been inside his head Saphirahe asked anxiously There was a pauseYes stone ears Relief seeped into himWhere are you She sent him an image of a small clump of treesI tried to contact you many times but you were beyond reach I was sick but Im better now Why couldnt I sense you earlier After two nights of waiting hunger bested me I had to hunt Did you catch anything A young buck He was wise enough to guard against the predators of land but not those of sky When I first caught him in my jaws he kicked vigorously and tried to escape I was stronger though and when defeat became unavoidable he gave up and died Does Garrow also fight the inevitable I dont knowHe told her the particulars then saidItll be a long time if ever before we can go home I wont be able to see you for at least a couple of days You might as well make yourself comfortable Unhappily she saidI will do as you say But do not take too long They parted reluctantly He looked out a window and was surprised to see that the sun had set Feeling very tired he limped to Elain who was wrapping meat pies with oilcloth Im going back to Gertrudes house to sleep he said She finished with the packages and asked Why dont you stay with us Youll be closer to your uncle and Gertrude can have her bed back Do you have enough room he asked wavering Of course She wiped her hands Come with me Ill get everything ready She escorted him upstairs to an empty room He sat on the edge of the bed Do you need anything else she asked He shook his head In that case Ill be downstairs Call me if you need help He listened as she descended the stairs Then he opened the door and slipped down the hallway to Garrows room Gertrude gave him a small smile over her darting knitting needles How is he whispered Eragon Her voice rasped with fatigue Hes weak but the fevers gone down a little and some of the burns look better Well have to wait and see but this could mean hell recover That lightened Eragons mood and he returned to his room The darkness seemed unfriendly as he huddled under the blankets Eventually he fell asleep healing the wounds his body and soul had suffered T HEMADNESS OFLIFE It was dark when Eragon jolted upright in bed breathing hard The room was chilly goose bumps formed on his arms and shoulders It was a few hours before dawnthe time when nothing moves and life waits for the first warm touches of sunlight His heart pounded as a terrible premonition gripped him It felt like a shroud lay over the world and its darkest corner was over his room He quietly got out of bed and dressed With apprehension he hurried down the hallway Alarm shot through him when he saw the door to Garrows room open and people clustered inside Garrow lay peacefully on the bed He was dressed in clean clothes his hair had been combed back and his face was calm He might have been sleeping if not for the silver amulet clasped around his neck and the sprig of dried hemlock on his chest the last gifts from the living to the dead Katrina stood next to the bed face pale and eyes downcast He heard her whisper I had hoped to call himFather one day Call him Fatherhe thought bitterlya right even I dont have He felt like a ghost drained of all vitality Everything was insubstantial except for Garrows face Tears flooded Eragons cheeks He stood there shoulders shaking but did not cry out Mother aunt unclehe had lost them all The weight of his grief was crushing a monstrous force that left him tottering Someone led him back to his room uttering consolations He fell on the bed wrapped his arms around his head and sobbed convulsively He felt Saphira contact him but he pushed her aside and let himself be swept away by sorrow He could not accept that Garrow was gone If he did what was left to believe in Only a merciless uncaring world that snuffed lives like candles before a wind Frustrated and terrified he turned his teardampened face toward the heavens and shouted What god would do this Show yourself He heard people running to his room but no answer came from above He didnt deserve this Comforting hands touched him and he was aware of Elain sitting next to him She held him as he cried and eventually exhausted he slipped unwillingly into sleep AR IDERSBLADE Anguish enveloped Eragon as he awoke Though he kept his eyes closed they could not stop a fresh flow of tears He searched for some idea or hope to help him keep his sanityI cant live with this he moaned Then dontSaphiras words reverberated in his head How Garrow is gone forever And in time I must meet the same fate Love family accomplishmentsthey are all torn away leaving nothing What is the worth of anything we do The worth is in the act Your worth halts when you surrender the will to change and experience life But options are before you choose one and dedicate yourself to it The deeds will give you new hope and purpose But what can I do The only true guide is your heart Nothing less than its supreme desire can help you She left him to ponder her statements Eragon examined his emotions It surprised him that more than grief he found a searing angerWhat do you want me to do pursue the strangers Yes Her frank answer confused him He took a deep trembling breathWhy Remember what you said in the Spine How you reminded me of my duty as dragon and I returned with you despite the urging of my instinct So too must you control yourself I thought long and deep the past few days and I realized what it means to be dragon and Rider It is our destiny to attempt the impossible to accomplish great deeds regardless of fear It is our responsibility to the future I dont care what you say those arent reasons to leavecried Eragon Then here are others My tracks have been seen and people are alert to my presence Eventually I will be exposed Besides there is nothing here for you No farm no family and Rorans not deadhe said vehemently But if you stay youll have to explain what really happened He has a right to know how and why his father died What might he do once he knows of me Saphiras arguments whirled around in Eragons head but he shrank from the idea of forsaking Palancar Valley it was his home Yet the thought of enacting vengeance on the strangers was fiercely comfortingAm I strong enough for this You have me Doubt besieged him It would be such a wild desperate thing to do Contempt for his indecision rose and a harsh smile danced on his lips Saphira was right Nothing mattered anymore except the act itselfThe doing is the thing And what would give him more satisfaction than hunting down the strangers A terrible energy and strength began to grow in him It grabbed his emotions and forged them into a solid bar of anger with one word stamped on it revenge His head pounded as he said with convictionI will do it He severed the contact with Saphira and rolled out of bed his body tense like a coiled spring It was still early morning he had only slept a few hoursNothing is more dangerous than an enemy with nothing to lose he thoughtWhich is what I have become Yesterday he had had difficulty walking upright but now he moved confidently held in place by his iron will The pain his body sent him was defied and ignored As he crept out of the house he heard the murmur of two people talking Curious he stopped and listened Elain was saying in her gentle voice place to stay We have room Horst answered inaudibly in his bass rumble Yes the poor boy replied Elain This time Eragon could hear Horsts response Maybe There was a long pause Ive been thinking about what Eragon said and Im not sure he told us everything What do you mean asked Elain There was concern in her voice When we started for their farm the road was scraped smooth by the board he dragged Garrow on Then we reached a place where the snow was all trampled and churned up His footprints and signs of the board stopped there but we also saw the same giant tracks from the farm And what about his legs I cant believe he didnt notice losing that much skin I didnt want to push him for answers earlier but now I think I will Maybe what he saw scared him so much that he doesnt want to talk about it suggested Elain You saw how distraught he was That still doesnt explain how he managed to get Garrow nearly all the way here without leaving any tracks Saphira was rightthought EragonIts time to leaveToo many questions from too many peopleSooner or later theyll find the answers He continued through the house tensing whenever the floor creaked The streets were clear few people were up at this time of day He stopped for a minute and forced himself to focusI dont need a horse Saphira will be my steed but she needs a saddle She can hunt for both of us so I dont have to worry about foodthough I should get some anyway Whatever else I need I can find buried in our house He went to Gedrics tanning vats on the outskirts of Carvahall The vile smell made him cringe but he kept moving heading for a shack set into the side of a hill where the cured hides were stored He cut down three large ox hides from the rows of skins hanging from the ceiling The thievery made him feel guilty but he reasonedIts not really stealing Ill pay Gedric back someday along with Horst He rolled up the thick leather and took it to a stand of trees away from the village He wedged the hides between the branches of a tree then returned to Carvahall Now for foodHe went to the tavern intending to get it there but then smiled tightly and reversed direction If he was going to steal it might as well be from Sloan He sneaked up to the butchers house The front door was barred whenever Sloan was not there but the side door was secured with only a thin chain which he broke easily The rooms inside were dark He fumbled blindly until his hands came upon hard piles of meat wrapped in cloth He stuffed as many of them as he could under his shirt then hurried back to the street and furtively closed the door A woman shouted his name nearby He clasped the bottom of his shirt to keep the meat from falling out and ducked behind a corner He shivered as Horst walked between two houses not ten feet away Eragon ran as soon as Horst was out of sight His legs burned as he pounded down an alley and back to the trees He slipped between the tree trunks then turned to see if he was being pursued No one was there Relieved he let out his breath and reached into the tree for the leather It was gone Going somewhere Eragon whirled around Brom scowled angrily at him an ugly wound on the side of his head A short sword hung at his belt in a brown sheath The hides were in his hands Eragons eyes narrowed in irritation How had the old man managed to sneak up on him Everything had been so quiet he would have sworn that no one was around Give them back he snapped Why So you can run off before Garrow is even buried The accusation was sharp Its none of your business he barked temper flashing Why did you follow me I didnt grunted Brom Ive been waiting for you here Now where are you going Nowhere Eragon lunged for the skins and grabbed them from Broms hands Brom did nothing to stop him I hope you have enough meat to feed your dragon Eragon froze What are you talking about Brom crossed his arms Dont fool with me I know where that mark on your hand the gedwëy ignasia theshining palm comes from you have touched a dragon hatchling I know why you came to me with those questions and I know that once more the Riders live Eragon dropped the leather and meatIts finally happened I have to get away I cant run faster than him with my injured legs but if Saphira he called For a few agonizing seconds she did not answer but thenYes Weve been discovered I need youHe sent her a picture of where he was and she took off immediately Now he just had to stall Brom How did you find out he asked in a hollow voice Brom stared into the distance and moved his lips soundlessly as if he were talking to someone else Then he said There were clues and hints everywhere I had only to pay attention Anyone with the right knowledge could have done the same Tell me how is your dragon She said Eragon is fine We werent at the farm when the strangers came Ah your legs You were flying How did Brom figure that out What if the strangers coerced him into doing this Maybe they want him to discover where Im going so they can ambush us And where is SaphiraHe reached out with his mind and found her circling far overheadCome No I will watch for a time Why Because of the slaughter at Dorú Areaba What Brom leaned against a tree with a slight smile I have talked with her and she has agreed to stay above us until we settle our differences As you can see you really dont have any choice but to answer my questions Now tell me where are you going Bewildered Eragon put a hand to his templeHow could Brom speak to Saphira The back of his head throbbed and ideas whirled through his mind but he kept reaching the same conclusion he had to tell the old man something He said I was going to find a safe place to stay while I heal And after that The question could not be ignored The throbbing in his head grew worse It was impossible to think nothing seemed clear anymore All he wanted to do was tell someone about the events of the past few months It tore at him that his secret had caused Garrows death He gave up and said tremulously I was going to hunt down the strangers and kill them A mighty task for one so young Brom said in a normal tone as if Eragon had proposed the most obvious and suitable thing to do Certainly a worthy endeavor and one you are fit to carry out yet it strikes me that help would not be unwelcome He reached behind a bush and pulled out a large pack His tone became gruff Anyway Im not going to stay behind while some stripling gets to run around with a dragon Is he really offering help or is it a trapEragon was afraid of what his mysterious enemies could doBut Brom convinced Saphira to trust him and theyve talked through the mind touchIf she isnt worried He decided to put his suspicions aside for the present I dont need help said Eragon then grudgingly added but you can come Then we had best be going said Brom His face blanked for a moment I think youll find that your dragon will listen to you again Saphiraasked Eragon Yes He resisted the urge to question herWill you meet us at the farm Yes So you reached an agreement I guess soShe broke contact and soared away He glanced at Carvahall and saw people running from house to house I think theyre looking for me Brom raised an eyebrow Probably Shall we go Eragon hesitated Id like to leave a message for Roran It doesnt seem right to run off without telling him why Its been taken care of assured Brom I left a letter for him with Gertrude explaining a few things I also cautioned him to be on guard for certain dangers Is that satisfactory Eragon nodded He wrapped the leather around the meat and started off They were careful to stay out of sight until they reached the road then quickened their pace eager to distance themselves from Carvahall Eragon plowed ahead determinedly his legs burning The mindless rhythm of walking freed his mind to thinkOnce we get home I wont travel any farther with Brom until I get some answers he told himself firmly I hope that he can tell me more about the Riders and whom Im fighting As the wreckage of the farm came into view Broms eyebrows beetled with anger Eragon was dismayed to see how swiftly nature was reclaiming the farm Snow and dirt were already piled inside the house concealing the violence of the strangers attack All that remained of the barn was a rapidly eroding rectangle of soot Broms head snapped up as the sound of Saphiras wings drifted over the trees She dived past them from behind almost brushing their heads They staggered as a wall of air buffeted them Saphiras scales glittered as she wheeled over the farm and landed gracefully Brom stepped forward with an expression both solemn and joyous His eyes were shining and a tear shone on his cheek before it disappeared into his beard He stood there for a long while breathing heavily as he watched Saphira and she him Eragon heard him muttering and edged closer to listen So it starts again But how and where will it end My sight is veiled I can not tell if this be tragedy or farce for the elements of both are here However it may be my station is unchanged and I Whatever else he might have said faded away as Saphira proudly approached them Eragon passed Brom pretended he had heard nothing and greeted her There was something different between them now as if they knew each other even more intimately yet were still strangers He rubbed her neck and his palm tingled as their minds touched A strong curiosity came from her Ive seen no humans except you and Garrow and he was badly injuredshe said Youve viewed people through my eyes Its not the sameShe came closer and turned her long head so that she could inspect Brom with one large blue eyeYou really are queer creatures she said critically and continued to stare at him Brom held still as she sniffed the air and then he extended a hand to her Saphira slowly bowed her head and allowed him to touch her on the brow With a snort she jerked back and retreated behind Eragon Her tail flicked over the ground What is ithe asked She did not answer Brom turned to him and asked in an undertone Whats her name Saphira A peculiar expression crossed Broms face He ground the butt of his staff into the earth with such force his knuckles turned white Of all the names you gave me it was the only one she liked I think it fits Eragon added quickly Fit it does said Brom There was something in his voice Eragon could not identify Was it loss wonder fear envy He was not sure it could have been none of them or all Brom raised his voice and said Greetings Saphira I am honored to meet you He twisted his hand in a strange gesture and bowed I like himsaid Saphira quietly Of course you do everyone enjoys flatteryEragon touched her on the shoulder and went to the ruined house Saphira trailed behind with Brom The old man looked vibrant and alive Eragon climbed into the house and crawled under a door into what was left of his room He barely recognized it under the piles of shattered wood Guided by memory he searched where the inside wall had been and found his empty pack Part of the frame was broken but the damage could be easily repaired He kept rummaging and eventually uncovered the end of his bow which was still in its buckskin tube Though the leather was scratched and scuffed he was pleased to see that the oiled wood was unharmedFinally some luck He strung the bow and pulled on the sinew experimentally It bent smoothly without any snaps or creaks Satisfied he hunted for his quiver which he found buried nearby Many of the arrows were broken He unstrung the bow and handed it and the quiver to Brom who said It takes a strong arm to pull that Eragon took the compliment silently He picked through the rest of the house for other useful items and dumped the collection next to Brom It was a meager pile What now asked Brom His eyes were sharp and inquisitive Eragon looked away We find a place to hide Do you have somewhere in mind Yes He wrapped all the supplies except for his bow into a tight bundle and tied it shut Hefting it onto his back he said This way and headed into the forestSaphira follow us in the air Your footprints are too easily found and tracked Very wellShe took off behind them Their destination was nearby but Eragon took a circuitous route in an effort to baffle any pursuers It was well over an hour before he finally stopped in a wellconcealed bramble The irregular clearing in the center was just large enough for a fire two people and a dragon Red squirrels scampered into the trees chattering in protest at their intrusion Brom extricated himself from a vine and looked around with interest Does anyone else know of this he asked No I found it when we first moved here It took me a week to dig into the center and another week to clear out all the deadwood Saphira landed beside them and folded her wings careful to avoid the thorns She curled up snapping twigs with her hard scales and rested her head on the ground Her unreadable eyes followed them closely Brom leaned against his staff and fixed his gaze on her His scrutiny made Eragon nervous Eragon watched them until hunger forced him to action He built a fire filled a pot with snow and then set it over the flames to melt When the water was hot he tore off chunks of meat and dropped them into the pot with a lump of saltNot much of a meal he thought grimlybut itll do Ill probably be eating this for some time to come so I might as well get used to it The stew simmered quietly spreading a rich aroma through the clearing The tip of Saphiras tongue snaked out and tasted the air When the meat was tender Brom came over and Eragon served the food They ate silently avoiding each others eyes Afterward Brom pulled out his pipe and lit it leisurely Why do you want to travel with me asked Eragon A cloud of smoke left Broms lips and spiraled up through the trees until it disappeared I have a vested interest in keeping you alive he said What do you mean demanded Eragon To put it bluntly Im a storyteller and I happen to think that you will make a fine story Youre the first Rider to exist outside of the kings control for over a hundred years What will happen Will you perish as a martyr Will you join the Varden Or will you kill King Galbatorix All fascinating questions And I will be there to see every bit of it no matter what I have to do A knot formed in Eragons stomach He could not see himself doing any of those things least of all becoming a martyrI want my vengeance but for the rest I have no ambition That may be but tell me how can you talk with Saphira Brom took his time putting more tobacco in his pipe Once it was relit and firmly in his mouth he said Very well if its answers you want its answers youll get but they may not be to your liking He got up brought his pack over to the fire and pulled out a long object wrapped in cloth It was about five feet long and from the way he handled it rather heavy He peeled away the cloth strip by strip like a mummy being unswathed Eragon gazed transfixed as a sword was revealed The gold pommel was teardrop shaped with the sides cut away to reveal a ruby the size of a small egg The hilt was wrapped in silver wire burnished until it gleamed like starlight The sheath was wine red and smooth as glass adorned solely by a strange black symbol etched into it Next to the sword was a leather belt with a heavy buckle The last strip fell away and Brom passed the weapon to Eragon The handle fit Eragons hand as if it had been made for him He slowly drew the sword it slid soundlessly from the sheath The flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in the firelight The keen edges curved gracefully to a sharp point A duplicate of the black symbol was inscribed on the metal The balance of the sword was perfect it felt like an extension of his arm unlike the rude farm tools he was used to An air of power lay over it as if an unstoppable force resided in its core It had been created for the violent convulsions of battle to end mens lives yet it held a terrible beauty This was once a Riders blade said Brom gravely When a Rider finished his training the elves would present him with a sword Their methods of forging have always remained secret However their swords are eternally sharp and will never stain The custom was to have the blades color match that of the Riders dragon but I think we can make an exception in this case This sword is named Zarroc I dont know what it means probably something personal to the Rider who owned it He watched Eragon swing the sword Where did you get it asked Eragon He reluctantly slipped the blade back into the sheath and attempted to hand the sword back but Brom made no move to take it It doesnt matter said Brom I will only say that it took me a series of nasty and dangerous adventures to attain it Consider it yours You have more of a claim to it than I do and before all is done I think you will need it The offer caught Eragon off guard It is a princely gift thank you Unsure of what else to say he slid his hand down the sheath What is this symbol he asked That was the Riders personal crest Eragon tried to interrupt but Brom glared at him until he was quiet Now if you must know anyone can learn how to speak to a dragon if they have the proper training And he raised a finger for emphasis it doesnt mean anything if they can I know more about the dragons and their abilities than almost anyone else alive On your own it might take years to learn what I can teach you Im offering my knowledge as a shortcut As for how I know so much I will keepthat to myself Saphira pulled herself up as he finished speaking and prowled over to Eragon He pulled out the blade and showed her the swordIt has power she said touching the point with her nose The metals iridescent color rippled like water as it met her scales She lifted her head with a satisfied snort and the sword resumed its normal appearance Eragon sheathed it troubled Brom raised an eyebrow Thats the sort of thing Im talking about Dragons will constantly amaze you Things happen around them mysterious things that are impossible anywhere else Even though the Riders worked with dragons for centuries they never completely understood their abilities Some say that even the dragons dont know the full extent of their own powers They are linked with this land in a way that lets them overcome great obstacles What Saphira just did illustrates my earlier point there is much you dont know There was a long pause That may be said Eragon but I can learn And the strangers are the most important thing I need to know about right now Do you have any idea who they are Brom took a deep breath They are called the Razac No one knows if thats the name of their race or what they have chosen to call themselves Either way if they have individual names they keep them hidden The Razac were never seen before Galbatorix came to power He must have found them during his travels and enlisted them in his service Little or nothing is known about them However I can tell you this they arent human When I glimpsed ones head it appeared to have something resembling a beak and black eyes as large as my fistthough how they manage our speech is a mystery to me Doubtless the rest of their bodies are just as twisted That is why they cover themselves with cloaks at all times regardless of the weather As for their powers they are stronger than any man and can jump incredible heights but they can not use magic Be thankful for that because if they could you would already be in their grasp I also know they have a strong aversion to sunlight though it wont stop them if theyre determined Dont make the mistake of underestimating a Razac for they are cunning and full of guile How many of them are there asked Eragon wondering how Brom could possibly know so much As far as I know only the two you saw There might be more but Ive never heard of them Perhaps theyre the last of a dying race You see they are the kings personal dragon hunters Whenever rumors reach Galbatorix of a dragon in the land he sends the Razac to investigate A trail of death often follows them Brom blew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles Eragon ignored the rings until he noticed that they were changing color and darting around Brom winked slyly Eragon was sure that no one had seen Saphira so how could Galbatorix have heard about her When he voiced his objections Brom said Youre right it seems unlikely that anyone from Carvahall could have informed the king Why dont you tell me where you got the egg and how you raised Saphirathat might clarify the issue Eragon hesitated then recounted all the events since he had found the egg in the Spine It felt wonderful to finally confide in someone Brom asked a few questions but most of the time he listened intently The sun was about to set when Eragon finished his tale Both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a soft pink Eragon eventually broke the silence I just wish I knew where she came from And Saphira doesnt remember Brom cocked his head I dont know Youve made many things clear to me I am sure that no one besides us has seen Saphira The Razac must have had a source of information outside of this valley one who is probably dead by now You have had a hard time and done much Im impressed Eragon stared blankly into the distance then asked What happened to your head It looks like you were hit with a rock No but thats a good guess He took a deep pull on the pipe I was sneaking around the Razacs camp after dark trying to learn what I could when they surprised me in the shadows It was a good trap but they underestimated me and I managed to drive them away Not however he said wryly without this token of my stupidity Stunned I fell to the ground and didnt regain consciousness until the next day By then they had already arrived at your farm It was too late to stop them but I set out after them anyway Thats when we met on the road Who is he to think that he could take on the Razac alone They ambushed him in the dark and he was only stunnedUnsettled Eragon asked hotly When you saw the mark the gedwëy ignasia on my palm why didnt you tell me who the Razac were I would have warned Garrow instead of going to Saphira first and the three of us could have fled Brom sighed I was unsure of what to do at the time I thought I could keep the Razac away from you and once they had left confront you about Saphira But they outsmarted me Its a mistake that I deeply regret and one that has cost you dearly Who are you demanded Eragon suddenly bitter How come a mere village storyteller happens to have a Riders sword How do you know about the Razac Brom tapped his pipe I thought I made it clear I wasnt going to talk about that My uncle is dead because of thisDead exclaimed Eragon slashing a hand through the air Ive trusted you this far because Saphira respects you but no more Youre not the person Ive known in Carvahall for all of these years Explain yourself For a long time Brom stared at the smoke swirling between them deep lines creasing his forehead When he stirred it was only to take another puff Finally he said Youve probably never thought about it but most of my life has been spent outside of Palancar Valley It was only in Carvahall that I took up the mantle of storyteller I have played many roles to different peopleIve a complicated past It was partly through a desire to escape it that I came here So no Im not the man you think I am Ha snorted Eragon Then who are you Brom smiled gently I am one who is here to help you Do not scorn those wordsthey are the truest Ive ever spoken But Im not going to answer your questions At this point you dont need to hear my history nor have you yet earned that right Yes I have knowledge Brom the storyteller wouldnt but Im more than he Youll have to learn to live with that fact and the fact that I dont hand out descriptions of my life to anyone who asks Eragon glared at him sullenly Im going to sleep he said leaving the fire Brom did not seem surprised but there was sorrow in his eyes He spread his bedroll next to the fire as Eragon lay beside Saphira An icy silence fell over the camp S ADDLEMAKING When Eragons eyes opened the memory of Garrows death crashed down on him He pulled the blankets over his head and cried quietly under their warm darkness It felt good just to lie there to hide from the world outside Eventually the tears stopped He cursed Brom Then he reluctantly wiped his cheeks and got up Brom was making breakfast Good morning he said Eragon grunted in reply He jammed his cold fingers in his armpits and crouched by the fire until the food was ready They ate quickly trying to consume the food before it lost its warmth When he finished Eragon washed his bowl with snow then spread the stolen leather on the ground What are you going to do with that asked Brom We cant carry it with us Im going to make a saddle for Saphira Mmm said Brom moving forward Well dragons used to have two kinds of saddles The first was hard and molded like a horses saddle But those take time and tools to make neither of which we have The other was thin and lightly padded nothing more than an extra layer between the Rider and dragon Those saddles were used whenever speed and flexibility were important though they werent nearly as comfortable as the molded ones Do you know what they looked like asked Eragon Better I can make one Then please do said Eragon standing aside Very well but pay attention Someday you may have to do this for yourself With Saphiras permission Brom measured her neck and chest Then he cut five bands out of the leather and outlined a dozen or so shapes on the hides Once the pieces had been sliced out he cut what remained of the hides into long cords Brom used the cords to sew everything together but for each stitch two holes had to be bored through the leather Eragon helped with that Intricate knots were rigged in place of buckles and every strap was made extra long so the saddle would still fit Saphira in the coming months The main part of the saddle was assembled from three identical sections sewn together with padding between them Attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit snugly around one of Saphiras neck spikes while wide bands sewn on either side would wrap around her belly and tie underneath Taking the place of stirrups were a series of loops running down both bands Tightened they would hold Eragons legs in place A long strap was constructed to pass between Saphiras front legs split in two and then come up behind her front legs to rejoin with the saddle While Brom worked Eragon repaired his pack and organized their supplies The day was spent by the time their tasks were completed Weary from his labor Brom put the saddle on Saphira and checked to see that the straps fit He made a few small adjustments then took it off satisfied You did a good job Eragon acknowledged grudgingly Brom inclined his head One tries his best It should serve you well the leathers sturdy enough Arent you going to try it outasked Saphira Maybe tomorrowsaid Eragon storing the saddle with his blanketsIts too late now In truth he was not eager to fly againnot after the disastrous outcome of his last attempt Dinner was made quickly It tasted good even though it was simple While they ate Brom looked over the fire at Eragon and asked Will we leave tomorrow There isnt any reason to stay I suppose not He shifted Eragon I must apologize about how events have turned out I never wished for this to happen Your family did not deserve such a tragedy If there were anything I could do to reverse it I would This is a terrible situation for all of us Eragon sat in silence avoiding Broms gaze then Brom said Were going to need horses Maybe you do but I have Saphira Brom shook his head There isnt a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon and Saphira is too young to carry us both Besides itll be safer if we stay together and riding is faster than walking But thatll make it harder to catch the Razac protested Eragon On Saphira I could probably find them within a day or two On horses itll take much longerif its even possible to overtake their lead on the ground Brom said slowly Thats a chance youll have to take if Im to accompany you Eragon thought it over All right he grumbled well get horses But you have to buy them I dont have any money and I dont want to steal again Its wrong That depends on your point of view corrected Brom with a slight smile Before you set out on this venture remember that your enemies the Razac are the kings servants They will be protected wherever they go Laws do not stop them In cities theyll have access to abundant resources and willing servants Also keep in mind that nothing is more important to Galbatorix than recruiting or killing youthough word of your existence probably hasnt reached him yet The longer you evade the Razac the more desperate hell become Hell know that every day youll be growing stronger and that each passing moment will give you another chance to join his enemies You must be very careful as you may easily turn from the hunter into the hunted Eragon was subdued by the strong words Pensive he rolled a twig between his fingers Enough talk said Brom Its late and my bones ache We can say more tomorrow Eragon nodded and banked the fire T HERINSFORD Dawn was gray and overcast with a cutting wind The forest was quiet After a light breakfast Brom and Eragon doused the fire and shouldered their packs preparing to leave Eragon hung his bow and quiver on the side of his pack where he could easily reach them Saphira wore the saddle she would have to carry it until they got horses Eragon carefully tied Zarroc onto her back too as he did not want the extra weight Besides in his hands the sword would be no better than a club Eragon had felt safe inside the bramble but outside wariness crept into his movements Saphira took off and circled overhead The trees thinned as they returned to the farm I will see this place againEragon insisted to himself looking at the ruined buildingsThis can not will not be a permanent exile Someday when its safe Ill return Throwing back his shoulders he faced south and the strange barbaric lands that lay there As they walked Saphira veered west toward the mountains and out of sight Eragon felt uncomfortable as he watched her go Even now with no one around they could not spend their days together She had to stay hidden in case they met a fellow traveler The Razacs footprints were faint on the eroding snow but Eragon was unconcerned It was unlikely that they had forsaken the road which was the easiest way out of the valley for the wilderness Once outside the valley however the road divided in several places It would be difficult to ascertain which branch the Razac had taken They traveled in silence concentrating on speed Eragons legs continued to bleed where the scabs had cracked To take his mind off the discomfort he asked So what exactly can dragons do You said that you knew something of their abilities Brom laughed his sapphire ring flashing in the air as he gestured Unfortunately its a pitiful amount compared to what I would like to know Your question is one people have been trying to answer for centuries so understand that what I tell you is by its very nature incomplete Dragons have always been mysterious though maybe not on purpose Before I can truly answer your question you need a basic education on the subject of dragons Its hopelessly confusing to start in the middle of such a complex topic without understanding the foundation on which it stands Ill begin with the life cycle of dragons and if that doesnt wear you out we can continue to another topic Brom explained how dragons mate and what it took for their eggs to hatch You see he said when a dragon lays an egg the infant inside is ready to hatch But it waits sometimes for years for the right circumstances When dragons lived in the wild those circumstances were usually dictated by the availability of food However once they formed an alliance with the elves a certain number of their eggs usually no more than one or two were given to the Riders each year These eggs or rather the infants inside wouldnt hatch until the person destined to be its Rider came into their presencethough how they sensed that isnt known People used to line up to touch the eggs hoping that one of them might be picked Do you mean that Saphira might not have hatched for me asked Eragon Quite possibly if she hadnt liked you He felt honored that of all the people in Alagaësia she had chosen him He wondered how long she had been waiting then shuddered at the thought of being cramped inside an egg surrounded by darkness Brom continued his lecture He explained what and when dragons ate A fully grown sedentary dragon could go for months without food but in mating season they had to eat every week Some plants could heal their sicknesses while others would make them ill There were various ways to care for their claws and clean their scales He explained the techniques to use when attacking from a dragon and what to do if you were fighting one whether on foot horseback or with another dragon Their bellies were armored their armpits were not Eragon constantly interrupted to ask questions and Brom seemed pleased by the inquiries Hours passed unheeded as they talked When evening came they were near Therinsford As the sky darkened and they searched for a place to camp Eragon asked Who was the Rider that owned Zarroc A mighty warrior said Brom who was much feared in his time and held great power What was his name Ill not say Eragon protested but Brom was firm I dont want to keep you ignorant far from it but certain knowledge would only prove dangerous and distracting for you right now There isnt any reason for me to trouble you with such things until you have the time and the power to deal with them I only wish to protect you from those who would use you for evil Eragon glared at him You know what I think you just enjoy speaking in riddles Ive half a mind to leave you so I dont have to be bothered with them If youre going to say something then say it instead of dancing around with vague phrases Peace All will be told in time Brom said gently Eragon grunted unconvinced They found a comfortable place to spend the night and set up camp Saphira joined them as dinner was being set on the fireDid you have time to hunt for food asked Eragon She snorted with amusementIf the two of you were any slower I would have time to fly across the sea and back without falling behind You dont have to be insulting Besides well go faster once we have horses She let out a puff of smokeMaybe but will it be enough to catch the Razac They have a lead of several days and many leagues And Im afraid they may suspect were following them Why else would they have destroyed the farm in such a spectacular manner unless they wished to provoke you into chasing them I dont knowsaid Eragon disturbed Saphira curled up beside him and he leaned against her belly welcoming the warmth Brom sat on the other side of the fire whittling two long sticks He suddenly threw one at Eragon who grabbed it out of reflex as it whirled over the crackling flames Defend yourself barked Brom standing Eragon looked at the stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a sword Brom wanted to fight him What chance did the old man standIf he wants to play this game so be it but if he thinks to beat me hes in for a surprise He rose as Brom circled the fire They faced each other for a moment then Brom charged swinging his stick Eragon tried to block the attack but was too slow He yelped as Brom struck him on the ribs and stumbled backward Without thinking he lunged forward but Brom easily parried the blow Eragon whipped the stick toward Broms head twisted it at the last moment and then tried to hit his side The solid smack of wood striking wood resounded through the camp Improvisationgood exclaimed Brom eyes gleaming His arm moved in a blur and there was an explosion of pain on the side of Eragons head He collapsed like an empty sack dazed A splash of cold water roused him to alertness and he sat up sputtering His head was ringing and there was dried blood on his face Brom stood over him with a pan of melted snow water You didnt have to do that said Eragon angrily pushing himself up He felt dizzy and unsteady Brom arched an eyebrow Oh A real enemy wouldnt soften his blows and neither will I Should I pander to your incompetence so youll feel better I dont think so He picked up the stick that Eragon had dropped and held it out Now defend yourself Eragon stared blankly at the piece of wood then shook his head Forget it Ive had enough He turned away and stumbled as he was whacked loudly across the back He spun around growling Never turn your back to the enemy snapped Brom then tossed the stick at him and attacked Eragon retreated around the fire beneath the onslaught Pull your arms in Keep your knees bent shouted Brom He continued to give instructions then paused to show Eragon exactly how to execute a certain move Do it again but this timeslowly They slid through the forms with exaggerated motions before returning to their furious battle Eragon learned quickly but no matter what he tried he could not hold Brom off for more than a few blows When they finished Eragon flopped on his blankets and groaned He hurt everywhereBrom had not been gentle with his stick Saphira let out a long coughing growl and curled her lip until a formidable row of teeth showed Whats wrong with youhe demanded irritably Nothingshe repliedIts funny to see a hatchling like you beaten by the old one She made the sound again and Eragon turned red as he realized that she was laughing Trying to preserve some dignity he rolled onto his side and fell asleep He felt even worse the next day Bruises covered his arms and he was almost too sore to move Brom looked up from the mush he was serving and grinned How do you feel Eragon grunted and bolted down the breakfast Once on the road they traveled swiftly so as to reach Therinsford before noon After a league the road widened and they saw smoke in the distance Youd better tell Saphira to fly ahead and wait for us on the other side of Therinsford said Brom She has to be careful here otherwise people are bound to notice her Why dont you tell her yourself challenged Eragon Its considered bad manners to interfere with anothers dragon You didnt have a problem with it in Carvahall Broms lips twitched with a smile I did what I had to Eragon eyed him darkly then relayed the instructions Saphira warnedBe careful the Empires servants could be hiding anywhere As the ruts in the road deepened Eragon noticed more footprints Farms signaled their approach to Therinsford The village was larger than Carvahall but it had been constructed haphazardly the houses aligned in no particular order What a mess said Eragon He could not see Demptons millBaldor and Albriech have surely fetched Roran by now Either way Eragon had no wish to face his cousin Its ugly if nothing else agreed Brom The Anora River flowed between them and the town spanned by a stout bridge As they approached it a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way His shirt was too short and his dirty stomach spilled over a rope belt Behind his cracked lips his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones You cn stop right there Thiss my bridge Got ta pay t get over How much asked Brom in a resigned voice He pulled out a pouch and the bridgekeeper brightened Five crowns he said pulling his lips into a broad smile Eragons temper flared at the exorbitant price and he started to complain hotly but Brom silenced him with a quick look The coins were wordlessly handed over The man put them into a sack hanging from his belt Thankee much he said in a mocking tone and stood out of the way As Brom stepped forward he stumbled and caught the bridgekeepers arm to support himself Watch yre step snarled the grimy man sidling away Sorry apologized Brom and continued over the bridge with Eragon Why didnt you haggle He skinned you alive exclaimed Eragon when they were out of earshot He probably doesnt even own the bridge We could have pushed right past him Probably agreed Brom Then why pay him Because you cant argue with all of the fools in the world Its easier to let them have their way then trick them when theyre not paying attention Brom opened his hand and a pile of coins glinted in the light You cut his purse said Eragon incredulously Brom pocketed the money with a wink And it held a surprising amount He should know better than to keep all these coins in one place There was a sudden howl of anguish from the other side of the river Id say our friend has just discovered his loss If you see any watchmen tell me He grabbed the shoulder of a young boy running between the houses and asked Do you know where we can buy horses The child stared at them with solemn eyes then pointed to a large barn near the edge of Therinsford Thank you said Brom tossing him a small coin The barns large double doors were open revealing two long rows of stalls The far wall was covered with saddles harnesses and other paraphernalia A man with muscular arms stood at the end brushing a white stallion He raised a hand and beckoned for them to come over As they approached Brom said Thats a beautiful animal Yes indeed His names Snowfire Mines Haberth Haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands vigorously with Eragon and Brom There was a polite pause as he waited for their names in return When they were not forthcoming he asked Can I help you Brom nodded We need two horses and a full set of tack for both The horses have to be fast and tough well be doing a lot of traveling Haberth was thoughtful for a moment I dont have many animals like that and the ones I do arent cheap The stallion moved restlessly he calmed it with a few strokes of his fingers Price is no object Ill take the best you have said Brom Haberth nodded and silently tied the stallion to a stall He went to the wall and started pulling down saddles and other items Soon he had two identical piles Next he walked up the line of stalls and brought out two horses One was a light bay the other a roan The bay tugged against his rope Hes a little spirited but with a firm hand you wont have any problems said Haberth handing the bays rope to Brom Brom let the horse smell his hand it allowed him to rub its neck Well take him he said then eyed the roan The other one however Im not so sure of There are some good legs on him Mmm What will you take for Snowfire Haberth looked fondly at the stallion Id rather not sell him Hes the finest Ive ever bredIm hoping to sire a whole line from him If you were willing to part with him how much would all of this cost me asked Brom Eragon tried to put his hand on the bay like Brom had but it shied away He automatically reached out with his mind to reassure the horse stiffening with surprise as he touched the animals consciousness The contact was not clear or sharp like it was with Saphira but he could communicate with the bay to a limited degree Tentatively he made it understand that he was a friend The horse calmed and looked at him with liquid brown eyes Haberth used his fingers to add up the price of the purchase Two hundred crowns and no less he said with a smile clearly confident that no one would pay that much Brom silently opened his pouch and counted out the money Will this do he asked There was a long silence as Haberth glanced between Snowfire and the coins A sigh then He is yours though I go against my heart I will treat him as if he had been sired by Gildintor the greatest steed of legend said Brom Your words gladden me answered Haberth bowing his head slightly He helped them saddle the horses When they were ready to leave he said Farewell then For the sake of Snowfire I hope that misfortune does not befall you Do not fear I will guard him well promised Brom as they departed Here he said handing Snowfires reins to Eragon go to the far side of Therinsford and wait there Why asked Eragon but Brom had already slipped away Annoyed he exited Therinsford with the two horses and stationed himself beside the road To the south he saw the hazy outline of Utgard sitting like a giant monolith at the end of the valley Its peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight towering over the lesser mountains that surrounded it Its dark ominous look made Eragons scalp tingle Brom returned shortly and gestured for Eragon to follow They walked until Therinsford was hidden by trees Then Brom said The Razac definitely passed this way Apparently they stopped here to pick up horses as we did I was able to find a man who saw them He described them with many shudders and said that they galloped out of Therinsford like demons fleeing a holy man They left quite an impression Quite Eragon patted the horses When we were in the barn I touched the bays mind by accident I didnt know it was possible to do that Brom frowned Its unusual for one as young as you to have the ability Most Riders had to train for years before they were strong enough to contact anything other than their dragon His face was thoughtful as he inspected Snowfire Then he said Take everything from your pack put it into the saddlebags and tie the pack on top Eragon did so while Brom mounted Snowfire Eragon gazed doubtfully at the bay It was so much smaller than Saphira that for an absurd moment he wondered if it could bear his weight With a sigh he awkwardly got into the saddle He had only ridden horses bareback and never for any distance Is this going to do the same thing to my legs as riding Saphira he asked How do they feel now Not too bad but I think any hard riding will open them up again Well take it easy promised Brom He gave Eragon a few pointers then they started off at a gentle pace Before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields yielded to wilder land Brambles and tangled weeds lined the road along with huge rosebushes that clung to their clothes Tall rocks slanted out of the groundgray witnesses to their presence There was an unfriendly feel in the air an animosity that resisted intruders Above them growing larger with every step loomed Utgard its craggy precipices deeply furrowed with snowy canyons The black rock of the mountain absorbed light like a sponge and dimmed the surrounding area Between Utgard and the line of mountains that formed the east side of Palancar Valley was a deep cleft It was the only practical way out of the valley The road led toward it The horses hooves clacked sharply over gravel and the road dwindled to a skinny trail as it skirted the base of Utgard Eragon glanced up at the peak looming over them and was startled to see a steepled tower perched upon it The turret was crumbling and in disrepair but it was still a stern sentinel over the valley What is that he asked pointing Brom did not look up but said sadly and with bitterness An outpost of the Ridersone that has lasted since their founding That was where Vrael took refuge and where through treachery he was found and defeated by Galbatorix When Vrael fell this area was tainted Edocsil Unconquerable was the name of this bastion for the mountain is so steep none may reach the top unless they can fly After Vraels death the commoners called it Utgard but it has another name Ristvakbaenthe Place of Sorrow It was known as such to the last Riders before they were killed by the king Eragon stared with awe Here was a tangible remnant of the Riders glory tarnished though it was by the relentless pull of time It struck him then just how old the Riders were A legacy of tradition and heroism that stretched back to antiquity had fallen upon him They traveled for long hours around Utgard It formed a solid wall to their right as they entered the breach that divided the mountain range Eragon stood in his stirrups he was impatient to see what lay outside of Palancar but it was still too far away For a while they were in a sloped pass winding over hill and gully following the Anora River Then with the sun low behind their backs they mounted a rise and saw over the trees Eragon gasped On either side were mountains but below them stretched a huge plain that extended to the distant horizon and fused into the sky The plain was a uniform tan like the color of dead grass Long wispy clouds swept by overhead shaped by fierce winds He understood now why Brom had insisted on horses It would have taken them weeks or months to cover that vast distance on foot Far above he saw Saphira circling high enough to be mistaken for a bird Well wait until tomorrow to make the descent said Brom Its going to take most of the day so we should camp now How far across is the plain Eragon asked still amazed Two or three days to over a fortnight depending on which direction we go Aside from the nomad tribes that roam this section of the plains its almost as uninhabited as the Hadarac Desert to the east So we arent going to find many villages However to the south the plains are less arid and more heavily populated They left the trail and dismounted by the Anora River As they unsaddled the horses Brom gestured at the bay You should name him Eragon considered it as he picketed the bay Well I dont have anything as noble as Snowfire but maybe this will do He placed his hand on the bay and said I name you Cadoc It was my grandfathers name so bear it well Brom nodded in approval but Eragon felt slightly foolish When Saphira landed he asked How do the plains look Dull Theres nothing but rabbits and scrub in every direction After dinner Brom stood and barked Catch Eragon barely had time to raise his arm and grab the piece of wood before it hit him on the head He groaned as he saw another makeshift sword Not again he complained Brom just smiled and beckoned with one hand Eragon reluctantly got to his feet They whirled around in a flurry of smacking wood and he backed away with a stinging arm The training session was shorter than the first but it was still long enough for Eragon to amass a new collection of bruises When they finished sparring he threw down the stick in disgust and stalked away from the fire to nurse his injuries T HUNDERROAR ANDLIGHTNINGCRACKLE The next morning Eragon avoided bringing to mind any of the recent events they were too painful for him to consider Instead he focused his energies on figuring out how to find and kill the RazacIll do it with my bow he decided imagining how the cloaked figures would look with arrows sticking out of them He had difficulty even standing up His muscles cramped with the slightest movement and one of his fingers was hot and swollen When they were ready to leave he mounted Cadoc and said acidly If this keeps up youre going to batter me to pieces I wouldnt push you so hard if I didnt think you were strong enough For once I wouldnt mind being thought less of muttered Eragon Cadoc pranced nervously as Saphira approached Saphira eyed the horse with something close to disgust and saidTheres nowhere to hide on the plains so Im not going to bother trying to stay out of sight Ill just fly above you from now on She took off and they began the steep descent In many places the trail all but disappeared leaving them to find their own way down At times they had to dismount and lead the horses on foot holding on to trees to keep from falling down the slope The ground was scattered with loose rocks which made the footing treacherous The ordeal left them hot and irritable despite the cold They stopped to rest when they reached the bottom near midday The Anora River veered to their left and flowed northward A biting wind scoured the land whipping them unmercifully The soil was parched and dirt flew into their eyes It unnerved Eragon how flat everything was the plains were unbroken by hummocks or mounds He had lived his entire life surrounded by mountains and hills Without them he felt exposed and vulnerable like a mouse under an eagles keen eye The trail split in three once it reached the plains The first branch turned north toward Ceunon one of the greatest northern cities the second one led straight across the plains and the last went south They examined all three for traces of the Razac and eventually found their tracks heading directly into the grasslands It seems theyve gone to Yazuac said Brom with a perplexed air Wheres that Due east and four days away if all goes well Its a small village situated by the Ninor River He gestured at the Anora which streamed away from them to the north Our only supply of water is here Well have to replenish our waterskins before attempting to cross the plains There isnt another pool or stream between here and Yazuac The excitement of the hunt began to rise within Eragon In a few days maybe less than a week he would use his arrows to avenge Garrows deathAnd then He refused to think about what might happen afterward They filled the waterskins watered the horses and drank as much as they could from the river Saphira joined them and took several gulps of water Fortified they turned eastward and started across the plains Eragon decided that it would be the wind that drove him crazy first Everything that made him miserablehis chapped lips parched tongue and burning eyesstemmed from it The ceaseless gusting followed them throughout the day Evening only strengthened the wind instead of subduing it Since there was no shelter they were forced to camp in the open Eragon found some scrub brush a short tough plant that thrived on harsh conditions and pulled it up He made a careful pile and tried to light it but the woody stems only smoked and gave off a pungent smell Frustrated he tossed the tinderbox to Brom I cant make it burn especially with this blasted wind See if you can get it going otherwise dinner will be cold Brom knelt by the brush and looked at it critically He rearranged a couple of branches then struck the tinderbox sending a cascade of sparks onto the plants There was smoke but nothing else Brom scowled and tried again but his luck was no better than Eragons Brisingr he swore angrily striking the flint again Flames suddenly appeared and he stepped back with a pleased expression There we go It must have been smoldering inside They sparred with mock swords while the food cooked Fatigue made it hard on both of them so they kept the session short After they had eaten they lay next to Saphira and slept grateful for her shelter The same cold wind greeted them in the morning sweeping over the dreadful flatness Eragons lips had cracked during the night every time he smiled or talked beads of blood covered them Licking them only made it worse It was the same for Brom They let the horses drink sparingly from their supply of water before mounting them The day was a monotonous trek of endless plodding On the third day Eragon woke well rested That coupled with the fact that the wind had stopped put him in a cheery humor His high spirits were dampened however when he saw the sky ahead of them was dark with thunderheads Brom looked at the clouds and grimaced Normally I wouldnt go into a storm like that but were in for a battering no matter what we do so we might as well get some distance covered It was still calm when they reached the storm front As they entered its shadow Eragon looked up The thundercloud had an exotic structure forming a natural cathedral with a massive arched roof With some imagination he could see pillars windows soaring tiers and snarling gargoyles It was a wild beauty As Eragon lowered his gaze a giant ripple raced toward them through the grass flattening it It took him a second to realize that the wave was a tremendous blast of wind Brom saw it too and they hunched their shoulders preparing for the storm The gale was almost upon them when Eragon had a horrible thought and twisted in his saddle yelling both with his voice and mindSaphira Land Broms face grew pale Overhead they saw her dive toward the groundShes not going to make it Saphira angled back the way they had come to gain time As they watched the tempests wrath struck them like a hammer blow Eragon gasped for breath and clenched the saddle as a frenzied howling filled his ears Cadoc swayed and dug his hooves into the ground mane snapping in the air The wind tore at their clothes with invisible fingers while the air darkened with billowing clouds of dust Eragon squinted searching for Saphira He saw her land heavily and then crouch clenching the ground with her talons The wind reached her just as she started to fold her wings With an angry yank it unfurled them and dragged her into the air For a moment she hung there suspended by the storms force Then it slammed her down on her back With a savage wrench Eragon yanked Cadoc around and galloped back up the trail goading the horse with both heels and mindSaphira he shoutedTry to stay on the ground Im coming He felt a grim acknowledgment from her As they neared Saphira Cadoc balked so Eragon leapt down and ran toward her His bow banged against his head A strong gust pushed him off balance and he flew forward landing on his chest He skidded then got back up with a snarl ignoring the deep scrapes in his skin Saphira was only three yards away but he could get no closer because of her flailing wings She struggled to fold them against the overpowering gale He rushed at her right wing intending to hold it down but the wind caught her and she somersaulted over him The spines on her back missed his head by inches Saphira clawed at the ground trying to stay down Her wings began to lift again but before they could flip her Eragon threw himself at the left one The wing crumpled in at the joints and Saphira tucked it firmly against her body Eragon vaulted over her back and tumbled onto the other wing Without warning it was blown upward sending him sliding to ground He broke his fall with a roll then jumped up and grabbed the wing again Saphira started to fold it and he pushed with all of his strength The wind battled with them for a second but with one last surge they overcame it Eragon leaned against Saphira pantingAre you all right He could feel her trembling She took a moment to answerI I think so She sounded shakenNothings brokenI couldnt do anything the wind wouldnt let me go I was helpless With a shudder she fell silent He looked at her concernedDont worry youre safe now He spotted Cadoc a ways off standing with his back to the wind With his mind Eragon instructed the horse to return to Brom He then got onto Saphira She crept up the road fighting the gale while he clung to her back and kept his head down When they reached Brom he shouted over the storm Is she hurt Eragon shook his head and dismounted Cadoc trotted over to him nickering As he stroked the horses long cheek Brom pointed at a dark curtain of rain sweeping toward them in rippling gray sheets What else cried Eragon pulling his clothes tighter He winced as the torrent reached them The stinging rain was cold as ice before long they were drenched and shivering Lightning lanced through the sky flickering in and out of existence Milehigh blue bolts streaked across the horizon followed by peals of thunder that shook the ground below It was beautiful but dangerously so Here and there grass fires were ignited by strikes only to be extinguished by the rain The wild elements were slow to abate but as the day passed they wandered elsewhere Once again the sky was revealed and the setting sun glowed with brilliance As beams of light tinted the clouds with blazing colors everything gained a sharp contrast brightly lit on one side deeply shadowed on the other Objects had a unique sense of mass grass stalks seemed sturdy as marble pillars Ordinary things took on an unearthly beauty Eragon felt as if he were sitting inside a painting The rejuvenated earth smelled fresh clearing their minds and raising their spirits Saphira stretched craning her neck and roared happily The horses skittered away from her but Eragon and Brom smiled at her exuberance Before the light faded they stopped for the night in a shallow depression Too exhausted to spar they went straight to sleep R EVELATION ATYAZUAC Although they had managed to partially refill the waterskins during the storm they drank the last of their water that morning I hope were going in the right direction said Eragon crunching up the empty water bag because well be in trouble if we dont reach Yazuac today Brom did not seem disturbed Ive traveled this way before Yazuac will be in sight before dusk Eragon laughed doubtfully Perhaps you see something I dont How can you know that when everything looks exactly the same for leagues around Because I am guided not by the land but by the stars and sun They will not lead us astray Come Let us be off It is foolish to conjure up woe where none exists Yazuac will be there His words proved true Saphira spotted the village first but it was not until later in the day that the rest of them saw it as a dark bump on the horizon Yazuac was still very far away it was only visible because of the plains uniform flatness As they rode closer a dark winding line appeared on either side of the town and disappeared in the distance The Ninor River said Brom pointing at it Eragon pulled Cadoc to a stop Saphira will be seen if she stays with us much longer Should she hide while we go into Yazuac Brom scratched his chin and looked at the town See that bend in the river Have her wait there Its far enough from Yazuac so no one should find her but close enough that she wont be left behind Well go through the town get what we need and then meet her I dont like itsaid Saphira when Eragon had explained the planThis is irritating having to hide all the time like a criminal You know what would happen if we were revealedShe grumbled but gave in and flew away low to the ground They kept a swift pace in anticipation of the food and drink they would soon enjoy As they approached the small houses they could see smoke from a dozen chimneys but there was no one in the streets An abnormal silence enveloped the village By unspoken consent they stopped before the first house Eragon abruptly said There arent any dogs barking No Doesnt mean anything though No Eragon paused Someone should have seen us by now Yes Then why hasnt anyone come out Brom squinted at the sun Could be afraid Could be said Eragon He was quiet for a moment And if its a trap The Razac might be waiting for us We need provisions and water Theres the Ninor Still need provisions True Eragon looked around So we go in Brom flicked his reins Yes but not like fools This is the main entrance to Yazuac If theres an ambush itll be along here No one will expect us to arrive from a different direction Around to the side then asked Eragon Brom nodded and pulled out his sword resting the bare blade across his saddle Eragon strung his bow and nocked an arrow They trotted quietly around the town and entered it cautiously The streets were empty except for a small fox that darted away as they came near The houses were dark and foreboding with shattered windows Many of the doors swung on broken hinges The horses rolled their eyes nervously Eragons palm tingled but he resisted the urge to scratch it As they rode into the center of town he gripped his bow tighter blanching Gods above he whispered A mountain of bodies rose above them the corpses stiff and grimacing Their clothes were soaked in blood and the churned ground was stained with it Slaughtered men lay over the women they had tried to protect mothers still clasped their children and lovers who had tried to shield each other rested in deaths cold embrace Black arrows stuck out of them all Neither young nor old had been spared But worst of all was the barbed spear that rose out of the peak of the pile impaling the white body of a baby Tears blurred Eragons vision and he tried to look away but the dead faces held his attention He stared at their open eyes and wondered how life could have left them so easilyWhat does our existence mean when it can end like this A wave of hopelessness overwhelmed him A crow dipped out of the sky like a black shadow and perched on the spear It cocked its head and greedily scrutinized the infants corpse Oh no you dont snarled Eragon as he pulled back the bowstring and released it with a twang With a puff of feathers the crow fell over backward the arrow protruding from its chest Eragon fit another arrow to the string but nausea rose from his stomach and he threw up over Cadocs side Brom patted him on the back When Eragon was done Brom asked gently Do you want to wait for me outside Yazuac No Ill stay said Eragon shakily wiping his mouth He avoided looking at the gruesome sight before them Who could have done He could not force out the words Brom bowed his head Those who love the pain and suffering of others They wear many faces and go by many disguises but there is only one name for them evil There is no understanding it All we can do is pity and honor the victims He dismounted Snowfire and walked around inspecting the trampled ground carefully The Razac passed this way he said slowly but this wasnt their doing This is Urgal work the spear is of their make A company of them came through here perhaps as many as a hundred Its odd I know of only a few instances when they have gathered in such He knelt and examined a footprint intently With a curse he ran back to Snowfire and leapt onto him Ride he hissed tightly spurring Snowfire forward There are still Urgals here Eragon jammed his heels into Cadoc The horse jumped forward and raced after Snowfire They dashed past the houses and were almost to the edge of Yazuac when Eragons palm tingled again He saw a flicker of movement to his right then a giant fist smashed him out of the saddle He flew back over Cadoc and crashed into a wall holding on to his bow only by instinct Gasping and stunned he staggered upright hugging his side An Urgal stood over him face set in a gross leer The monster was tall thick and broader than a doorway with gray skin and yellow piggish eyes Muscles bulged on his arms and chest which was covered by a too small breastplate An iron cap rested over the pair of rams horns curling from his temples and a roundshield was bound to one arm His powerful hand held a short wicked sword Behind him Eragon saw Brom rein in Snowfire and start back only to be stopped by the appearance of a second Urgal this one with an ax Run you fool Brom cried to Eragon cleaving at his enemy The Urgal in front of Eragon roared and swung his sword mightily Eragon jerked back with a startled yelp as the weapon whistled past his cheek He spun around and fled toward the center of Yazuac heart pounding wildly The Urgal pursued him heavy boots thudding Eragon sent a desperate cry for help to Saphira then forced himself to go even faster The Urgal rapidly gained ground despite Eragons efforts large fangs separated in a soundless bellow With the Urgal almost upon him Eragon strung an arrow spun to a stop took aim and released The Urgal snapped up his arm and caught the quivering bolt on his shield The monster collided with Eragon before he could shoot again and they fell to the ground in a confused tangle Eragon sprang to his feet and rushed back to Brom who was trading fierce blows with his opponent from Snowfires backWhere are the rest of the Urgals wondered Eragon franticallyAre these two the only ones in Yazuac There was a loud smack and Snowfire reared whinnying Brom doubled over in his saddle blood streaming down his arm The Urgal beside him howled in triumph and raised his ax for the death blow A deafening scream tore out of Eragon as he charged the Urgal headfirst The Urgal paused in astonishment then faced him contemptuously swinging his ax Eragon ducked under the twohanded blow and clawed the Urgals side leaving bloody furrows The Urgals face twisted with rage He slashed again but missed as Eragon dived to the side and scrambled down an alley Eragon concentrated on leading the Urgals away from Brom He slipped into a narrow passageway between two houses saw it was a dead end and slid to a stop He tried to back out but the Urgals had already blocked the entrance They advanced cursing him in their gravelly voices Eragon swung his head from side to side searching for a way out but there was none As he faced the Urgals images flashed in his mind dead villagers piled around the spear and an innocent baby who would never grow to adulthood At the thought of their fate a burning fiery power gathered from every part of his body It was more than a desire for justice It was his entire being rebelling against the fact of deaththat he would cease to exist The power grew stronger and stronger until he felt ready to burst from the contained force He stood tall and straight all fear gone He raised his bow smoothly The Urgals laughed and lifted their shields Eragon sighted down the shaft as he had done hundreds of times and aligned the arrowhead with his target The energy inside him burned at an unbearable level He had to release it or it would consume him A word suddenly leapt unbidden to his lips He shot yelling Brisingr The arrow hissed through the air glowing with a crackling blue light It struck the lead Urgal on the forehead and the air resounded with an explosion A blue shock wave blasted out of the monsters head killing the other Urgal instantly It reached Eragon before he had time to react and it passed through him without harm dissipating against the houses Eragon stood panting then looked at his icy palm The gedwëy ignasia was glowing like whitehot metal yet even as he watched it faded back to normal He clenched his fist then a wave of exhaustion washed over him He felt strange and feeble as if he had not eaten for days His knees buckled and he sagged against a wall A DMONISHMENTS Once a modicum of strength returned to him Eragon staggered out of the alley skirting the dead monsters He did not get far before Cadoc trotted to his side Good you werent hurt mumbled Eragon He noticed without particularly caring that his hands were shaking violently and his movements were jerky He felt detached as if everything he saw were happening to someone else Eragon found Snowfire nostrils flared and ears flat against his head prancing by the corner of a house ready to bolt Brom was still slumped motionless in the saddle Eragon reached out with his mind and soothed the horse Once Snowfire relaxed Eragon went to Brom There was a long bloodsoaked cut on the old mans right arm The wound bled profusely but it was neither deep nor wide Still Eragon knew it had to be bound before Brom lost too much blood He stroked Snowfire for a moment then slid Brom out of the saddle The weight proved too much for him and Brom dropped heavily to the ground Eragon was shocked by his own weakness A scream of rage filled his head Saphira dived out of the sky and landed fiercely in front of him keeping her wings half raised She hissed angrily eyes burning Her tail lashed and Eragon winced as it snapped overheadAre you hurt she asked rage boiling in her voice No he assured her as he laid Brom on his back She growled and exclaimedWhere are the ones who did this I will tear them apart He wearily pointed in the direction of the alley Itll do no good theyre already dead You killed themSaphira sounded surprised He nodded Somehow With a few terse words he told her what had happened while he searched his saddlebags for the rags in which Zarroc had been wrapped Saphira said gravelyYou have grown Eragon grunted He found a long rag and carefully rolled back Broms sleeve With a few deft strokes he cleaned the cut and bandaged it tightlyI wish we were still in Palancar Valley he said to SaphiraThere at least I knew what plants were good for healing Here I dont have any idea what will help him He retrieved Broms sword from the ground wiped it then returned it to the sheath on Broms belt We should leavesaid SaphiraThere may be more Urgals lurking about Can you carry BromYour saddle will hold him in place and you can protect him Yes but Im not leaving you alone Fine fly next to me but lets get out of hereHe tied the saddle onto Saphira then put his arms around Brom and tried to lift him but again his diminished strength failed himSaphirahelp She snaked her head past him and caught the back of Broms robe between her teeth Arching her neck she lifted the old man off the ground like a cat would a kitten and deposited him onto her back Then Eragon slipped Broms legs through the saddles straps and tightened them He looked up when the old man moaned and shifted Brom blinked blearily putting a hand to his head He gazed down at Eragon with concern Did Saphira get here in time Eragon shook his head Ill explain it later Your arm is injured I bandaged it as best I could but you need a safe place to rest Yes said Brom gingerly touching his arm Do you know where my sword Ah I see you found it Eragon finished tightening the straps Saphiras going to take you and follow me by air Are you sure you want me to ride her asked Brom I can ride Snowfire Not with that arm This way even if you faint you wont fall off Brom nodded Im honored He wrapped his good arm around Saphiras neck and she took off in a flurry springing high into the sky Eragon backed away buffeted by the eddies from her wings and returned to the horses He tied Snowfire behind Cadoc then left Yazuac returning to the trail and following it southward It led through a rocky area veered left and continued along the bank of the Ninor River Ferns mosses and small bushes dotted the side of the path It was refreshingly cool under the trees but Eragon did not let the soothing air lull him into a sense of security He stopped briefly to fill the waterskins and let the horses drink Glancing down he saw the Razacs spoorAt least were going in the right direction Saphira circled overhead keeping a keen eye on him It disturbed him that they had seen only two Urgals The villagers had been killed and Yazuac ransacked by a large horde yet where was itPerhaps the ones we encountered were a rear guard or a trap left for anyone who was following the main force His thoughts turned to how he had killed the Urgals An idea a revelation slowly wormed its way through his mind He Eragonfarm boy of Palancar Valleyhad used magicMagic It was the only word for what had happened It seemed impossible but he could not deny what he had seenSomehow Ive become a sorcerer or wizard But he did not know how to use this new power again or what its limits and dangers might beHow can I have this ability Was it common among the Riders And if Brom knew of it why didnt he tell me He shook his head in wonder and bewilderment He conversed with Saphira to check on Broms condition and to share his thoughts She was just as puzzled as he was about the magicSaphira can you find us a place to stay I cant see very far down here While she searched he continued along the Ninor The summons reached him just as the light was fadingCome Saphira sent him an image of a secluded clearing in the trees by the river Eragon turned the horses in the new direction and nudged them into a trot With Saphiras help it was easy to find but it was so well hidden that he doubted anyone else would notice it A small smokeless fire was already burning when he entered the clearing Brom sat next to it tending his arm which he held at an awkward angle Saphira was crouched beside him her body tense She looked intently at Eragon and askedAre you sure you arent hurt Not on the outside but Im not sure about the rest of me I should have been there sooner Dont feel bad We all made mistakes today Mine was not staying closer to youHer gratitude for that remark washed over him He looked at Brom How are you The old man glanced at his arm Its a large scratch and hurts terribly but it should heal quickly enough I need a fresh bandage this one didnt last as long as Id hoped They boiled water to wash Broms wound Then Brom tied a fresh rag to his arm and said I must eat and you look hungry as well Lets have dinner first then talk When their bellies were full and warm Brom lit his pipe Now I think its time for you to tell me what transpired while I was unconscious I am most curious His face reflected the flickering firelight and his bushy eyebrows stuck out fiercely Eragon nervously clasped his hands and told the story without embellishment Brom remained silent throughout it his face inscrutable When Eragon finished Brom looked down at the ground For a long time the only sound was the snapping fire Brom finally stirred Have you used this power before No Do you know anything about it A little Broms face was thoughtful It seems I owe you a debt for saving my life I hope I can return the favor someday You should be proud few escape unscathed from slaying their first Urgal But the manner in which you did it was very dangerous You could have destroyed yourself and the whole town It wasnt as if I had a choice said Eragon defensively The Urgals were almost upon me If I had waited they would have chopped me into pieces Brom stamped his teeth vigorously on the pipe stem You didnt have any idea what you were doing Then tell me challenged Eragon Ive been searching for answers to this mystery but I cant make sense of it What happened How could I have possibly used magic No one has ever instructed me in it or taught me spells Broms eyes flashed This isnt something you should be taughtmuch less use Well Ihave used it and I may need it to fight again But I wont be able to if you dont help me Whats wrong Is there some secret Im not supposed to learn until Im old and wise Or maybe you dont know anything about magic Boy roared Brom You demand answers with an insolence rarely seen If you knew what you asked for you would not be so quick to inquire Do not try me He paused then relaxed into a kinder countenance The knowledge you ask for is more complex than you understand Eragon rose hotly in protest I feel as though Ive been thrust into a world with strange rules that no one will explain I understand said Brom He fiddled with a piece of grass Its late and we should sleep but I will tell you a few things now to stop your badgering This magicfor it is magichas rules like the rest of the world If you break the rules the penalty is death without exception Your deeds are limited by your strength the words you know and your imagination What do you mean by words asked Eragon More questions cried Brom For a moment I had hoped you were empty of them But you are quite right in asking When you shot the Urgals didnt you say something Yesbrisingr The fire flared and a shiver ran through Eragon Something about the word made him feel incredibly alive I thought soBrisingr is from an ancient language that all living things used to speak However it was forgotten over time and went unspoken for eons in Alagaësia until the elves brought it back over the sea They taught it to the other races who used it for making and doing powerful things The language has a name for everything if you can find it But what does that have to do with magic interrupted Eragon Everything It is the basis for all power The language describes the true nature of things not the superficial aspects that everyone sees For example fire is calledbrisingr Not only is thata name for fire it isthe name for fire If you are strong enough you can usebrisingr to direct fire to do whatever you will And that is what happened today Eragon thought about it for a moment Why was the fire blue How come it did exactly what I wanted if all I said wasfire The color varies from person to person It depends on who says the word As to why the fire did what you wanted thats a matter of practice Most beginners have to spell out exactly what they want to happen As they gain more experience it isnt as necessary A true master could just saywater and create something totally unrelated like a gemstone You wouldnt be able to understand how he had done it but the master would have seen the connection betweenwater and the gem and would have used that as the focal point for his power The practice is more of an art than anything else What you did was extremely difficult Saphira interrupted Eragons thoughtsBrom is a magician Thats how he was able to light the fire on the plains He doesnt just know about magic he can use it himself Eragons eyes widenedYoure right Ask him about this power but be careful of what you say It is unwise to trifle with those who have such abilities If he is a wizard or sorcerer who knows what his motives might have been for settling in Carvahall Eragon kept that in mind as he said carefully Saphira and I just realized something You can use this magic cant you Thats how you started the fire our first day on the plains Brom inclined his head slightly I am proficient to some degree Then why didnt you fight the Urgals with it In fact I can think of many times when it would have been usefulyou could have shielded us from the storm and kept the dirt out of our eyes After refilling his pipe Brom said Some simple reasons really I am not a Rider which means that even at your weakest moment you are stronger than I And I have outlived my youth Im not as strong as I used to be Every time I reach for magic it gets a little harder Eragon dropped his eyes abashed Im sorry Dont be said Brom as he shifted his arm It happens to everyone Where did you learn to use magic That is one fact Ill keep to myself Suffice it to say it was in a remote area and from a very good teacher I can at the very least pass on his lessons Brom snuffed his pipe with a small rock I know that you have more questions and I will answer them but they must wait until morning He leaned forward eyes gleaming Until then I will say this to discourage any experiments magic takes just as much energy as if you used your arms and back That is why you felt tired after destroying the Urgals And that is why I was angry It was a dreadful risk on your part If the magic had used more energy than was in your body it would have killed you You should use magic only for tasks that cant be accomplished the mundane way How do you know if a spell will use all your energy asked Eragon frightened Brom raised his hands Most of the time you dont Thats why magicians have to know their limits well and even then they are cautious Once you commit to a task and release the magic you cant pull it back even if its going to kill you I mean this as a warning dont try anything until youve learned more Now enough of this for tonight As they spread out their blankets Saphira commented with satisfactionWe are becoming more powerful Eragon both of us Soon no one will be able to stand in our way Yes but which way shall we choose Whichever one we wantshe said smugly settling down for the night M AGICIS THE SIMPLESTTHING Why do you think those two Urgals were still in Yazuac asked Eragon after they had been on the trail for a while There doesnt seem to be any reason for them to have stayed behind I suspect they deserted the main group to loot the town What makes it odd is that as far as I know Urgals have gathered in force only two or three times in history Its unsettling that they are doing it now Do you think the Razac caused the attack I dont know The best thing we can do is continue away from Yazuac at the fastest pace we can muster Besides this is the direction the Razac went south Eragon agreed We still need provisions however Is there another town nearby Brom shook his head No but Saphira can hunt for us if we must survive on meat alone This swath of trees may look small to you but there are plenty of animals in it The river is the only source of water for many miles around so most of the plains animals come here to drink We wont starve Eragon remained quiet satisfied with Broms answer As they rode loud birds darted around them and the river rushed by peacefully It was a noisy place full of life and energy Eragon asked How did that Urgal get you Things were happening so fast I didnt see Bad luck really grumbled Brom I was more than a match for him so he kicked Snowfire The idiot of a horse reared and threw me off balance That was all the Urgal needed to give me this gash He scratched his chin I suppose youre still wondering about this magic The fact that youve discovered it presents a thorny problem Few know it but every Rider could use magic though with differing strengths They kept the ability secret even at the height of their power because it gave them an advantage over their enemies Had everyone known about it dealing with common people would have been difficult Many think the kings magical powers come from the fact that he is a wizard or sorcerer Thats not true it is because hes a Rider Whats the difference Doesnt the fact that I used magic make me a sorcerer Not at all A sorcerer like a Shade uses spirits to accomplish his will That is totally different from your power Nor does that make you a magician whose powers come without the aid of spirits or a dragon And youre certainly not a witch or wizard who get their powers from various potions and spells Which brings me back to my original point the problem youve presented Young Riders like yourself were put through a strict regimen designed to strengthen their bodies and increase their mental control This regimen continued for many months occasionally years until the Riders were deemed responsible enough to handle magic Up until then not one student was told of his potential powers If one of them discovered magic by accident he or she was immediately taken away for private tutoring It was rare for anyone to discover magic on his own he inclined his head toward Eragon though they were never put under the same pressure you were Then how were they finally trained to use magic asked Eragon I dont see how you could teach it to anyone If you had tried to explain it to me two days ago it wouldnt have made any sense The students were presented with a series of pointless exercises designed to frustrate them For example they were instructed to move piles of stones using only their feet fill ever draining tubs full of water and other impossibilities After a time they would get infuriated enough to use magic Most of the time it succeeded What this means Brom continued is that you will be disadvantaged if you ever meet an enemy who has received this training There are still some alive who are that old the king for one not to mention the elves Any one of those could tear you apart with ease What can I do then There isnt time for formal instruction but we can do much while we travel said Brom I know many techniques you can practice that will give you strength and control but you can not gain the discipline the Riders had overnight You he looked at Eragon humorously will have to amass it on the run It will be hard in the beginning but the rewards will be great It may please you to know that no Rider your age ever used magic the way you did yesterday with those two Urgals Eragon smiled at the praise Thank you Does this language have a name Brom laughed Yes but no one knows it It would be a word of incredible power something by which you could control the entire language and those who use it People have long searched for it but no one has ever found it I still dont understand how this magic works said Eragon Exactly how do I use it Brom looked astonished I havent made that clear No Brom took a deep breath and said To work with magic you must have a certain innate power which is very rare among people nowadays You also have to be able to summon this power at will Once it is called upon you have to use it or let it fade away Understood Now if you wish to employ the power you must utter the word or phrase of the ancient language that describes your intent For example if you hadnt saidbrisingr yesterday nothing would have happened So Im limited by my knowledge of this language Exactly crowed Brom Also while speaking it its impossible to practice deceit Eragon shook his head That cant be People always lie The sounds of the ancient words cant stop them from doing that Brom cocked an eyebrow and said Fethrblaka eka weohnata néiat haina ono Blaka eom iet lam A bird suddenly flitted from a branch and landed on his hand It trilled lightly and looked at them with beady eyes After a moment he said Eitha and it fluttered away How did you do that asked Eragon in wonder I promised not to harm him He may not have known exactly what I meant but in the language of power the meaning of my words was evident The bird trusted me because he knows what all animals do that those who speak in that tongue are bound by their word And the elves speak this language Yes So they never lie Not quite admitted Brom They maintain that they dont and in a way its true but they have perfected the art of saying one thing and meaning another You never know exactly what their intent is or if you have fathomed it correctly Many times they only reveal part of the truth and withhold the rest It takes a refined and subtle mind to deal with their culture Eragon considered that What do personal names mean in this language Do they give power over people Broms eyes brightened with approval Yes they do Those who speak the language have two names The first is for everyday use and has little authority But the second is their true name and is shared with only a few trusted people There was a time when no one concealed his true name but this age isnt as kind Whoever knows your true name gains enormous power over you Its like putting your life into another persons hands Everyone has a hidden name but few know what it is How do you find your true name asked Eragon Elves instinctively know theirs No one else has that gift The human Riders usually went on quests to discover itor found an elf who would tell them which was rare for elves dont distribute that knowledge freely replied Brom Id like to know mine Eragon said wistfully Broms brow darkened Be careful It can be a terrible knowledge To know who you are without any delusions or sympathy is a moment of revelation that no one experiences unscathed Some have been driven to madness by that stark reality Most try to forget it But as much as the name will give others power so you may gain power over yourself if the truth doesnt break you And Im sure that it would notstated Saphira I still wish to know said Eragon determined You are not easily dissuaded That is good for only the resolute find their identity but I can not help you with this It is a search that you will have to undertake on your own Brom moved his injured arm and grimaced uncomfortably Why cant you or I heal that with magic asked Eragon Brom blinked No reasonI just never considered it because its beyond my strength You could probably do it with the right word but I dont want you to exhaust yourself I could save you a lot of trouble and pain protested Eragon Ill live with it said Brom flatly Using magic to heal a wound takes just as much energy as it would to mend on its own I dont want you tired for the next few days You shouldnt attempt such a difficult task yet Still if its possible to fix your arm could I bring someone back from the dead The question surprised Brom but he answered quickly Remember what I said about projects that will kill you That is one of them Riders were forbidden to try to resurrect the dead for their own safety There is an abyss beyond life where magic means nothing If you reach into it your strength will flee and your soul will fade into darkness Wizards sorcerers and Ridersall have failed and died on that threshold Stick with whats possiblecuts bruises maybe some broken bonesbut definitely not dead people Eragon frowned This is a lot more complex than I thought Exactly said Brom And if you dont understand what youre doing youll try something too big and die He twisted in his saddle and swooped down grabbing a handful of pebbles from the ground With effort he righted himself then discarded all but one of the rocks See this pebble Yes Take it Eragon did and stared at the unremarkable lump It was dull black smooth and as large as the end of his thumb There were countless stones like it on the trail This is your training Eragon looked back at him confused I dont understand Of course you dont said Brom impatiently Thats why Im teaching you and not the other way around Now stop talking or well never get anywhere What I want you to do is lift the rock off your palm and hold it in the air for as long as you can The words youre going to use arestenr reisa Say them Stenr reisa Good Go ahead and try Eragon focused sourly on the pebble searching his mind for any hint of the energy that had burned in him the day before The stone remained motionless as he stared at it sweating and frustratedHow am I supposed to do this Finally he crossed his arms and snapped This is impossible No said Brom gruffly Illsay when its impossible or not Fight for it Dont give in this easily Try again Frowning Eragon closed his eyes setting aside all distracting thoughts He took a deep breath and reached into the farthest corners of his consciousness trying to find where his power resided Searching he found only thoughts and memories until he felt something differenta small bump that was a part of him and yet not of him Excited he dug into it seeking what it hid He felt resistance a barrier in his mind but knew that the power lay on the other side He tried to breach it but it held firm before his efforts Growing angry Eragon drove into the barrier ramming against it with all of his might until it shattered like a thin pane of glass flooding his mind with a river of light Stenr reisa he gasped The pebble wobbled into the air over his faintly glowing palm He struggled to keep it floating but the power slipped away and faded back behind the barrier The pebble dropped to his hand with a soft plop and his palm returned to normal He felt a little tired but grinned from his success Not bad for your first time said Brom Why does my hand do that Its like a little lantern No ones sure Brom admitted The Riders always preferred to channel their power through whichever hand bore the gedwëy ignasia You can use your other palm but it isnt as easy He looked at Eragon for a minute Ill buy you some gloves at the next town if it isnt gutted You hide the mark pretty well on your own but we dont want anyone to see it by accident Besides there may be times when you wont want the glow to alert an enemy Do you have a mark of your own No Only Riders have them said Brom Also you should know that magic is affected by distance just like an arrow or a spear If you try to lift or move something a mile away itll take more energy than if you were closer So if you see enemies racing after you from a league away let them approach before using magic Now back to work Try to lift the pebble again Again asked Eragon weakly thinking of the effort it had taken to do it just once Yes And this time be quicker about it They continued with the exercises throughout most of the day When Eragon finally stopped he was tired and illtempered In those hours he had come to hate the pebble and everything about it He started to throw it away but Brom said Dont Keep it Eragon glared at him then reluctantly tucked the stone into a pocket Were not done yet warned Brom so dont get comfortable He pointed at a small plant This is calleddelois From there on he instructed Eragon in the ancient language giving him words to memorize fromvöndr a thin straight stick to the morning starAiedail That evening they sparred around the fire Though Brom fought with his left hand his skill was undiminished The days followed the same pattern First Eragon struggled to learn the ancient words and to manipulate the pebble Then in the evening he trained against Brom with the fake swords Eragon was in constant discomfort but he gradually began to change almost without noticing Soon the pebble no longer wobbled when he lifted it He mastered the first exercises Brom gave him and undertook harder ones and his knowledge of the ancient language grew In their sparring Eragon gained confidence and speed striking like a snake His blows became heavier and his arm no longer trembled when he warded off attacks The clashes lasted longer as he learned how to fend off Brom Now when they went to sleep Eragon was not the only one with bruises Saphira continued to grow as well but more slowly than before Her extended flights along with periodic hunts kept her fit and healthy She was taller than the horses now and much longer Because of her size and the way her scales sparkled she was altogether too visible Brom and Eragon worried about it but they could not convince her to allow dirt to obscure her scintillating hide They continued south tracking the Razac It frustrated Eragon that no matter how fast they went the Razac always stayed a few days ahead of them At times he was ready to give up but then they would find some mark or print that would renew his hope There were no signs of habitation along the Ninor or in the plains leaving the three companions undisturbed as the days slipped by Finally they neared Daret the first village since Yazuac The night before they reached the village Eragons dreams were especially vivid He saw Garrow and Roran at home sitting in the destroyed kitchen They asked him for help rebuilding the farm but he only shook his head with a pang of longing in his heart Im tracking your killers he whispered to his uncle Garrow looked at him askance and demanded Do I look dead to you I cant help you said Eragon softly feeling tears in his eyes There was a sudden roar and Garrow transformed into the Razac Then die they hissed and leapt at Eragon He woke up feeling ill and watched the stars slowly turn in the sky All will be well little onesaid Saphira gently D ARET Daret was on the banks of the Ninor Riveras it had to be to survive The village was small and wildlooking without any signs of inhabitants Eragon and Brom approached it with great caution Saphira hid close to the town this time if trouble arose she would be at their sides within seconds They rode into Daret striving to be silent Brom gripped his sword with his good hand eyes flashing everywhere Eragon kept his bow partially drawn as they passed between the silent houses glancing at each other with apprehensionThis doesnt look good commented Eragon to Saphira She did not answer but he felt her prepare to rush after them He looked at the ground and was reassured to see the fresh footprints of childrenBut where are they Brom stiffened as they entered the center of Daret and found it empty Wind blew through the desolate town and dust devils swirled sporadically Brom wheeled Snowfire about Lets get out of here I dont like the feel of this He spurred Snowfire into a gallop Eragon followed him urging Cadoc onward They advanced only a few strides before wagons toppled out from behind the houses and blocked their way Cadoc snorted and dug in his hooves sliding to a stop next to Snowfire A swarthy man hopped over the wagon and planted himself before them a broadsword slung at his side and a drawn bow in his hands Eragon swung his own bow up and pointed it at the stranger who commanded Halt Put your weapons down Youre surrounded by sixty archers Theyll shoot if you move As if on cue a row of men stood up on the roofs of the surrounding houses Stay away Saphiracried EragonThere are too many If you come theyll shoot you out of the sky Stay away She heard but he was unsure if she would obey He prepared to use magicIll have to stop the arrows before they hit me or Brom What do you want asked Brom calmly Why have you come here demanded the man To buy supplies and hear the news Nothing more Were on the way to my cousins house in DrasLeona Youre armed pretty heavily So are you said Brom These are dangerous times True The man looked at them carefully I dont think you mean us ill but weve had too many encounters with Urgals and bandits for me to trust you only on your word If it doesnt matter what we say what happens now countered Brom The men on top of the houses had not moved By their very stillness Eragon was sure that they were either highly disciplined or frightened for their lives He hoped it was the latter You say that you only want supplies Would you agree to stay here while we bring what you need then pay us and leave immediately Yes All right said the man lowering his bow though he kept it ready He waved at one of the archers who slid to the ground and ran over Tell him what you want Brom recited a short list and then added Also if you have a spare pair of gloves that would fit my nephew Id like to buy those too The archer nodded and ran off The names Trevor said the man standing in front of them Normally Id shake your hand but under the circumstances I think Ill keep my distance Tell me where are you from North said Brom but we havent lived in any place long enough to call it home Have Urgals forced you to take these measures Yes said Trevor and worse fiends Do you have any news from other towns We receive word from them rarely but there have been reports that they are also beleaguered Brom turned grave I wish it wasnt our lot to bring you these tidings Nearly a fortnight ago we passed through Yazuac and found it pillaged The villagers had been slaughtered and piled together We would have tried to give them a decent burial but two Urgals attacked us Shocked Trevor stepped back and looked down with tears in his eyes Alas this is indeed a dark day Still I dont see how two Urgals could have defeated all of Yazuac The people there were good fighterssome were my friends There were signs that a band of Urgals had ravaged the town stated Brom I think the ones we encountered were deserters How large was the company Brom fiddled with his saddlebags for a minute Large enough to wipe out Yazuac but small enough to go unnoticed in the countryside No more than a hundred and no less than fifty If Im not mistaken either number would prove fatal to you Trevor wearily agreed You should consider leaving Brom continued This area has become far too perilous for anyone to live in peace I know but the people here refuse to consider moving This is their homeas well as mine though I have only been here a couple yearsand they place its worth above their own lives Trevor looked at him seriously We have repulsed individual Urgals and that has given the townspeople a confidence far beyond their abilities I fear that we will all wake up one morning with our throats slashed The archer hurried out of a house with a pile of goods in his arms He set them next to the horses and Brom paid him As the man left Brom asked Why did they choose you to defend Daret Trevor shrugged I was in the kings army for some years Brom dug through the items handed Eragon the pair of gloves and packed the rest of the supplies into their saddlebags Eragon pulled the gloves on being careful to keep his palm facing down and flexed his hands The leather felt good and strong though it was scarred from use Well said Brom as I promised we will go now Trevor nodded When you enter DrasLeona would you do us this favor Alert the Empire to our plight and that of the other towns If word of this hasnt reached the king by now its cause for worry And if it has but he has chosen to do nothing that too is cause for worry We will carry your message May your swords stay sharp said Brom And yours The wagons were pulled out of their way and they rode from Daret into the trees along the Ninor River Eragon sent his thoughts to SaphiraWere on our way back Everything turned out all right Her only response was simmering anger Brom pulled at his beard The Empire is in worse condition than I had imagined When the traders visited Carvahall they brought reports of unrest but I never believed that it was this widespread With all these Urgals around it seems that the Empire itself is under attack yet no troops or soldiers have been sent out Its as if the king doesnt care to defend his domain It is strange agreed Eragon Brom ducked under a lowhanging branch Did you use any of your powers while we were in Daret There was no reason to Wrong corrected Brom You could have sensed Trevors intentions Even with my limited abilities I was able to do that If the villagers had been bent on killing us I wouldnt have just sat there However I felt there was a reasonable chance of talking our way out of there which is what I did How could I know what Trevor was thinking asked Eragon Am I supposed to be able to see into peoples minds Come now chided Brom you should know the answer to that You could have discovered Trevors purpose in the same way that you communicate with Cadoc or Saphira The minds of men are not so different from a dragons or horses Its a simple thing to do but its a power you must use sparingly and with great caution A persons mind is his last sanctuary You must never violate it unless circumstances force you to The Riders had very strict rules regarding this If they were broken without due cause the punishment was severe And you can do this even though you arent a Rider asked Eragon As I said before with the right instruction anyone can talk with their minds but with differing amounts of success Whether its magic though is hard to tell Magical abilities will certainly trigger the talentor becoming linked with a dragonbut Ive known plenty who learned it on their own Think about it you can communicate with any sentient being though the contact may not be very clear You could spend the entire day listening to a birds thoughts or understanding how an earthworm feels during a rainstorm But Ive never found birds very interesting I suggest starting with a cat they have unusual personalities Eragon twisted Cadocs reins in his hands considering the implications of what Brom had said But if I can get into someones head doesnt that mean that others can do the same to me How do I know if someones prying in my mind Is there a way to stop thatHow do I know if Brom can tell what Im thinking right now Why yes Hasnt Saphira ever blocked you from her mind Occasionally admitted Eragon When she took me into the Spine I couldnt talk to her at all It wasnt that she was ignoring me I dont think she could even hear me There were walls around her mind that I couldnt get through Brom worked on his bandage for a moment shifting it higher on his arm Only a few people can tell if someone is in their mind and of those only a handful could stop you from entering Its a matter of training and of how you think Because of your magical power youll always know if someone is in your mind Once you do blocking them is a simple matter of concentrating on one thing to the exclusion of all else For instance if you only think about a brick wall thats all the enemy will find in your mind However it takes a huge amount of energy and discipline to block someone for any length of time If youre distracted by even the slightest thing your wall will waver and your opponent will slip in through the weakness How can I learn to do this asked Eragon There is only one thing for it practice practice and yet more practice Picture something in your mind and hold it there to the exclusion of all else for as long as you can It is a very advanced ability only a handful ever master it said Brom I dont need perfection just safetyIf I can get into someones mind can I change how he thinks Every time I learn something new about magic I grow more wary of it When they reached Saphira she startled them by thrusting her head at them The horses backstepped nervously Saphira looked Eragon over carefully and gave a low hiss Her eyes were flinty Eragon threw a concerned look at Bromhe had never seen Saphira this angrythen askedWhats wrong Youshe growledYou are the problem Eragon frowned and got off Cadoc As soon as his feet touched the ground Saphira swept his legs out from under him with her tail and pinned him with her talons What are you doing he yelled struggling to get up but she was too strong for him Brom watched attentively from Snowfire Saphira swung her head over Eragon until they were eye to eye He squirmed under her unwavering glareYou Every time you leave my sight you get into trouble Youre like a new hatchling sticking your nose into everything And what happens when you stick it into something that bites back How will you survive then I can not help you when Im miles away Ive stayed hidden so that no one would see me but no longer Not when it may cost you your life I can understand why youre upsetsaid Eragonbut Im much older than you and can take care of myself If anything youre the one who needs to be protected She snarled and snapped her teeth by his earDo you really believe that she askedTomorrow you will ride menot that pitiful deeranimal you call a horseor else I will carry you in my claws Are you a Dragon Rider or not Dont you care for me The question burned in Eragon and he dropped his gaze He knew she was right but he was scared of riding her Their flights had been the most painful ordeal he had ever endured Well demanded Brom She wants me to ride her tomorrow said Eragon lamely Brom considered it with twinkling eyes Well you have the saddle I suppose that if the two of you stay out of sight it wont be a problem Saphira switched her gaze to him then returned it to Eragon But what if youre attacked or theres an accident I wont be able to get there in time and Saphira pressed harder on his chest stopping his wordsExactly my point little one Brom seemed to hide a smile Its worth the risk You need to learn how to ride her anyway Think about it this way with you flying ahead and looking at the ground youll be able to spot any traps ambushes or other unwelcome surprises Eragon looked back at Saphira and saidOkay Ill do it But let me up Give me your word Is that really necessaryhe demanded She blinkedVery well I give you my word that I will fly with you tomorrow Satisfied I am content Saphira let him up and with a push of her legs took off A small shiver ran through Eragon as he watched her twist through the air Grumbling he returned to Cadoc and followed Brom It was nearly sundown when they made camp As usual Eragon dueled with Brom before dinner In the midst of the fight Eragon delivered such a powerful blow that he snapped both of their sticks like twigs The pieces whistled into the darkness in a cloud of splintered fragments Brom tossed what remained of his stick into the fire and said Were done with these throw yours in as well You have learned well but weve gone as far as we can with branches There is nothing more you can gain from them It is time for you to use the blade He removed Zarroc from Eragons bag and gave it to him Well cut each other to ribbons protested Eragon Not so Again you forget magic said Brom He held up his sword and turned it so that firelight glinted off the edge He put a finger on either side of the blade and focused intensely deepening the lines on his forehead For a moment nothing happened then he uttered Gëuloth du knífr and a small red spark jumped between his fingers As it flickered back and forth he ran his fingers down the length of the sword Then he twirled it and did the same thing on the other side The spark vanished the moment his fingers left the metal Brom held his hand out palm up and slashed it with the sword Eragon jumped forward but was too slow to stop him He was astonished when Brom raised his unharmed hand with a smile What did you do asked Eragon Feel the edge said Brom Eragon touched it and felt an invisible surface under his fingers The barrier was about a quarter inch wide and very slippery Now do the same on Zarroc instructed Brom Your block will be a bit different than mine but it should accomplish the same thing He told Eragon how to pronounce the words and coached him through the process It took Eragon a few tries but he soon had Zarrocs edge protected Confident he took his fighting stance Before they started Brom admonished These swords wont cut us but they can still break bones I would prefer to avoid that so dont flail around like you normally do A blow to the neck could prove fatal Eragon nodded then struck without warning Sparks flew off his blade and the clash of metal filled their campsite as Brom parried The sword felt slow and heavy to Eragon after fighting with sticks for so long Unable to move Zarroc fast enough he received a sharp rap on his knee They both had large welts when they stopped Eragon more so than Brom He marveled that Zarroc had not been scratched or dented by the vigorous pounding it had received T HROUGH A DRAGONSEYE The next morning Eragon woke with stiff limbs and purple bruises He saw Brom carry the saddle to Saphira and tried to quell his uneasiness By the time breakfast was ready Brom had strapped the saddle onto Saphira and hung Eragons bags from it When his bowl was empty Eragon silently picked up his bow and went to Saphira Brom said Now remember grip with your knees guide her with your thoughts and stay as flat as you can on her back Nothing will go wrong if you dont panic Eragon nodded sliding his unstrung bow into its leather tube and Brom boosted him into the saddle Saphira waited impatiently while Eragon tightened the bands around his legsAre you ready she asked He sucked in the fresh morning airNo but lets do it She agreed enthusiastically He braced himself as she crouched Her powerful legs surged and the air whipped past him snatching his breath away With three smooth strokes of her wings she was in the sky climbing rapidly The last time Eragon had ridden Saphira every flap of her wings had been strained Now she flew steadily and effortlessly He clenched his arms around her neck as she turned on edge banking The river shrank to a wispy gray line beneath them Clouds floated around them When they leveled off high above the plains the trees below were no more than specks The air was thin chilly and perfectly clear This is wonderfu His words were lost as Saphira tilted and rolled completely around The ground spun in a dizzying circle and vertigo clutched Eragon Dont do that he cried I feel like Im going to fall off You must become accustomed to it If Im attacked in the air thats one of the simplest maneuvers I will doshe replied He could think of no rebuttal so he concentrated on controlling his stomach Saphira angled into a shallow dive and slowly approached the ground Although Eragons stomach lurched with every wobble he began to enjoy himself He relaxed his arms a bit and stretched his neck back taking in the scenery Saphira let him enjoy the sights awhile then saidLet me show you what flying is really like Howhe asked Relax and do not be afraidshe said Her mind tugged at his pulling him away from his body Eragon fought for a moment then surrendered control His vision blurred and he found himself looking through Saphiras eyes Everything was distorted colors had weird exotic tints blues were more prominent now while greens and reds were subdued Eragon tried to turn his head and body but could not He felt like a ghost who had slipped out of the ether Pure joy radiated from Saphira as she climbed into the sky She loved this freedom to go anywhere When they were high above the ground she looked back at Eragon He saw himself as she did hanging on to her with a blank look He could feel her body strain against the air using updrafts to rise All her muscles were like his own He felt her tail swinging through the air like a giant rudder to correct her course It surprised him how much she depended on it Their connection grew stronger until there was no distinction between their identities They clasped their wings together and dived straight down like a spear thrown from on high No terror of falling touched Eragon engulfed as he was in Saphiras exhilaration The air rushed past their face Their tail whipped in the air and their joined minds reveled in the experience Even as they plummeted toward the ground there was no fear of collision They snapped open their wings at just the right moment pulling out of the dive with their combined strength Slanting toward the sky they shot up and continued back over into a giant loop As they leveled out their minds began to diverge becoming distinct personalities again For a split second Eragon felt both his body and Saphiras Then his vision blurred and he again sat on her back He gasped and collapsed on the saddle It was minutes before his heart stopped hammering and his breathing calmed Once he had recovered he exclaimedThat was incredible How can you bear to land when you enjoy flying so much I must eatshe said with some amusementBut I am glad that you took pleasure in it Those are spare words for such an experience Im sorry I havent flown with you more I never thought it could be like that Do you always see so much blue It is the way I am We will fly together more often now Yes Every chance we get Goodshe replied in a contented tone They exchanged many thoughts as she flew talking as they had not for weeks Saphira showed Eragon how she used hills and trees to hide and how she could conceal herself in the shadow of a cloud They scouted the trail for Brom which proved to be more arduous than Eragon expected They could not see the path unless Saphira flew very close to it in which case she risked being detected Near midday an annoying buzz filled Eragons ears and he became aware of a strange pressure on his mind He shook his head trying to get rid of it but the tension only grew stronger Broms words about how people could break into others minds flashed through Eragons head and he frantically tried to clear his thoughts He concentrated on one of Saphiras scales and forced himself to ignore everything else The pressure faded for a moment and then returned greater than ever A sudden gust rocked Saphira and Eragons concentration slipped Before he could marshal any defenses the force broke through But instead of the invasive presence of another mind there were only the wordsWhat do you think youre doing Get down here I found something important Bromqueried Eragon Yesthe old man said irritablyNow get that oversized lizard of yours to land Im here He sent a picture of his location Eragon quickly told Saphira where to go and she banked toward the river below Meanwhile he strung his bow and drew several arrows If theres trouble Ill be ready for it As will Isaid Saphira When they reached Brom Eragon saw him standing in a clearing waving his arms Saphira landed and Eragon jumped off her and looked for danger The horses were tied to a tree on the edge of the clearing but otherwise Brom was alone Eragon trotted over and asked Whats wrong Brom scratched his chin and muttered a string of curses Dont ever block me out like that again Its hard enough for me to reach you without having to fight to make myself heard Sorry He snorted I was farther down the river when I noticed that the Razacs tracks had ceased I backtracked until I found where they had disappeared Look at the ground and tell me what you see Eragon knelt and examined the dirt and found a confusion of impressions that were difficult to decipher Numerous Razac footprints overlapped each other Eragon guessed that the tracks were only a few days old Superimposed over them were long thick gouges torn into the ground They looked familiar but Eragon could not say why He stood shaking his head I dont have any idea what Then his eyes fell on Saphira and he realized what had made the gouges Every time she took off her back claws dug into the ground and ripped it in the same manner This doesnt make any sense but the only thing I can think of is that the Razac flew off on dragons Or else they got onto giant birds and disappeared into the heavens Tell me you have a better explanation Brom shrugged Ive heard reports of the Razac moving from place to place with incredible speed but this is the first evidence Ive had of it It will be almost impossible to find them if they have flying steeds They arent dragonsI know that much A dragon would never consent to bear a Razac What do we do Saphira cant track them through the sky Even if she could we would leave you far behind Theres no easy solution to this riddle said Brom Lets have lunch while we think on it Perhaps inspiration will strike us while we eat Eragon glumly went to his bags for food They ate in silence staring at the empty sky Once again Eragon thought of home and wondered what Roran was doing A vision of the burnt farm appeared before him and grief threatened to overwhelm himWhat will I do if we cant find the Razac What is my purpose then I could return to Carvahall he plucked a twig from the ground and snapped it between two fingersor just travel with Brom and continue my trainingEragon stared out at the plains hoping to quiet his thoughts When Brom finished eating he stood and threw back his hood I have considered every trick I know every word of power within my grasp and all the skills we have but I still dont see how we can find the Razac Eragon slumped against Saphira in despair Saphira could show herself at some town That would draw the Razac like flies to honey But it would be an extremely risky thing to attempt The Razac would bring soldiers with them and the king might be interested enough to come himself which would spell certain death for you and me So what now asked Eragon throwing his hands upDo you have any ideas Saphira No Thats up to you said Brom This is your crusade Eragon ground his teeth angrily and stalked away from Brom and Saphira Just as he was about to enter the trees his foot struck something hard Lying on the ground was a metal flask with a leather strap just long enough to hang off someones shoulder A silver insignia Eragon recognized as the Razacs symbol was wrought into it Excited he picked up the flask and unscrewed its cap A cloying smell filled the airthe same one he had noticed when he found Garrow in the wreckage of their house He tilted the flask and a drop of clear shiny liquid fell on his finger Instantly Eragons finger burned as if it were on fire He yelped and scrubbed his hand on the ground After a moment the pain subsided to a dull throbbing A patch of skin had been eaten away Grimacing he jogged back to Brom Look what I found Brom took the flask and examined it then poured a bit of the liquid into the cap Eragon started to warn him Watch out itll burn My skin I know said Brom And I suppose you went ahead and poured it all over your hand Your finger Well at least you showed sense enough not to drink it Only a puddle would have been left of you What is it asked Eragon Oil from the petals of the Seithr plant which grows on a small island in the frigid northern seas In its natural state the oil is used for preserving pearlsit makes them lustrous and strong But when specific words are spoken over the oil along with a blood sacrifice it gains the property to eat any flesh That alone wouldnt make it specialthere are plenty of acids that can dissolve sinew and boneexcept for the fact that it leaves everything else untouched You can dip anything into the oil and pull it out unharmed unless it was once part of an animal or human This has made it a weapon of choice for torture and assassination It can be stored in wood slathered on the point of a spear or dripped onto sheets so that the next person to touch them will be burned There are myriad uses for it limited only by your ingenuity Any injury caused by it is always slow to heal Its rather rare and expensive especially this converted form Eragon remembered the terrible burns that had covered GarrowThats what they used on him he realized with horror I wonder why the Razac left it behind if its so valuable It must have slipped off when they flew away But why didnt they come back for it I doubt that the king will be pleased that they lost it No he wont said Brom but he would be even more displeased if they delayed bringing him news of you In fact if the Razac have reached him by now you can be sure that the king has learned your name And that means we will have to be much more careful when we go into towns There will be notices and alerts about you posted throughout the Empire Eragon paused to think This oil how rare is it exactly Like diamonds in a pig trough said Brom He amended himself after a second Actually the normal oil is used by jewelers but only those who can afford it So there are people who trade in it Perhaps one maybe two Good said Eragon Now do the cities along the coast keep shipping records Broms eyes brightened Of course they do If we could get to those records they would tell us who brought the oil south and where it went from there And the record of the Empires purchase will tell us where the Razac live concluded Eragon I dont know how many people can afford this oil but it shouldnt be hard to figure out which ones arent working for the Empire Genius exclaimed Brom smiling I wish I had thought of this years ago it would have saved me many headaches The coast is dotted with numerous cities and towns where ships can land I suppose that Teirm would be the place to start as it controls most of the trade Brom paused The last I heard my old friend Jeod lives there We havent seen each other for many years but he might be willing to help us And because hes a merchant its possible that he has access to those records How do we get to Teirm Well have to go southwest until we reach a high pass in the Spine Once on the other side we can head up the coast to Teirm said Brom A gentle wind pulled at his hair Can we reach the pass within a week Easily If we angle away from the Ninor and to our right we might be able to see the mountains by tomorrow Eragon went to Saphira and mounted her Ill see you at dinner then When they were at a good height he saidIm going to ride Cadoc tomorrow Before you protest know that I am only doing it because I want to talk with Brom You should ride with him every other day That way you can still receive your instruction and I will have time to hunt You wont be troubled by it It is necessary When they landed for the day he was pleased to discover that his legs did not hurt The saddle had protected him well from Saphiras scales Eragon and Brom had their nightly fight but it lacked energy as both were preoccupied with the days events By the time they finished Eragons arms burned from Zarrocs unaccustomed weight AS ONG FOR THEROAD The next day while they were riding Eragon asked Brom What is the sea like You must have heard it described before said Brom Yes but what is it really like Broms eyes grew hazy as if he looked upon some hidden scene The sea is emotion incarnate It loves hates and weeps It defies all attempts to capture it with words and rejects all shackles No matter what you say about it there is always that which you cant Do you remember what I told you about how the elves came over the sea Yes Though they live far from the coast they retain a great fascination and passion for the ocean The sound of crashing waves the smell of salt air it affects them deeply and has inspired many of their loveliest songs There is one that tells of this love if you want to hear it I would said Eragon interested Brom cleared his throat and said I will translate it from the ancient language as best I can It wont be perfect but perhaps it will give you an idea of how the original sounds He pulled Snowfire to a stop and closed his eyes He was silent for a while then chanted softly O liquid temptress neath the azure sky Your gilded expanse calls me calls me For I would sail ever on Were it not for the elven maid Who calls me calls me She binds my heart with a lilywhite tie Never to be broken save by the sea Ever to be torn twixt the trees and the waves The words echoed hauntingly in Eragons head There is much more to that song the Du Silbena Datia I have only recited one of its verses It tells the sad tale of two lovers Acallamh and Nuada who were separated by longing for the sea The elves find great meaning in the story Its beautiful said Eragon simply The Spine was a faint outline on the horizon when they halted that evening When they arrived at the Spines foothills they turned and followed the mountains south Eragon was glad to be near the mountains again they placed comforting boundaries on the world Three days later they came to a wide road rutted by wagon wheels This is the main road between the capital Urûbaen and Teirm said Brom Its widely used and a favorite route for merchants We have to be more cautious This isnt the busiest time of year but a few people are bound to be using the road Days passed quickly as they continued to trek along the Spine searching for the mountain pass Eragon could not complain of boredom When not learning the elven language he was either learning how to care for Saphira or practicing magic Eragon also learned how to kill game with magic which saved them time hunting He would hold a small rock on his hand and shoot it at his prey It was impossible to miss The results of his efforts roasted over the fire each night And after dinner Brom and Eragon would spar with swords and occasionally fists The long days and strenuous work stripped Eragons body of excess fat His arms became corded and his tanned skin rippled with lean musclesEverything about me is turning hard he thought dryly When they finally reached the pass Eragon saw that a river rushed out of it and cut across the road This is the Toark explained Brom Well follow it all the way to the sea How can we laughed Eragon if it flows out of the Spine inthis direction It wont end up in the ocean unless it doubles back on itself Brom twisted the ring on his finger Because in the middle of the mountains rests the Woadark Lake A river flows from each end of it and both are called the Toark We see the eastward one now It runs to the south and winds through the brush until it joins Leona Lake The other one goes to the sea After two days in the Spine they came upon a rock ledge from which they could see clearly out of the mountains Eragon noticed how the land flattened in the distance and he groaned at the leagues they still had to traverse Brom pointed Down there and to the north lies Teirm It is an old city Some say its where the elves first landed in Alagaësia Its citadel has never fallen nor have its warriors ever been defeated He spurred Snowfire forward and left the ledge It took them until noon the next day to descend through the foothills and arrive at the other side of the Spine where the forested land quickly leveled out Without the mountains to hide behind Saphira flew close to the ground using every hollow and dip in the land to conceal herself Beyond the forest they noticed a change The countryside was covered with soft turf and heather that their feet sank into Moss clung to every stone and branch and lined the streams that laced the ground Pools of mud pocked the road where horses had trampled the dirt Before long both Brom and Eragon were splattered with grime Why is everything green asked Eragon Dont they have winter here Yes but the season is mild Mist and fog roll in from the sea and keep everything alive Some find it to their liking but to me its dreary and depressing When evening fell they set up camp in the driest spot they could find As they ate Brom commented You should continue to ride Cadoc until we reach Teirm Its likely that well meet other travelers now that we are out of the Spine and it will be better if you are with me An old man traveling alone will raise suspicion With you at my side no one will ask questions Besides I dont want to show up at the city and have someone who saw me on the trail wondering where you suddenly came from Will we use our own names asked Eragon Brom thought about it We wont be able to deceive Jeod He already knows my name and I think I trust him with yours But to everyone else I will be Neal and you will be my nephew Evan If our tongues slip and give us away it probably wont make a difference but I dont want our names in anyones heads People have an annoying habit of remembering things they shouldnt AT ASTE OFTEIRM After two days of traveling north toward the ocean Saphira sighted Teirm A heavy fog clung to the ground obscuring Broms and Eragons sight until a breeze from the west blew the mist away Eragon gaped as Teirm was suddenly revealed before them nestled by the edge of the shimmering sea where proud ships were docked with furled sails The surfs dull thunder could be heard in the distance The city was contained behind a white walla hundred feet tall and thirty feet thickwith rows of rectangular arrow slits lining it and a walkway on top for soldiers and watchmen The walls smooth surface was broken by two iron portcullises one facing the western sea the other opening south to the road Above the walland set against its northeast sectionrose a huge citadel built of giant stones and turrets In the highest tower a lighthouse lantern gleamed brilliantly The castle was the only thing visible over the fortifications Soldiers guarded the southern gate but held their pikes carelessly This is our first test said Brom Lets hope they havent received reports of us from the Empire and wont detain us Whatever happens dont panic or act suspiciously Eragon told SaphiraYou should land somewhere now and hide Were going in Sticking your nose where it doesnt belong Againshe said sourly I know But Brom and I do have some advantages most people dontWell be all right If anything happens Im going to pin you to my back and never let you off I love you too Then I will bind you all the tighter Eragon and Brom rode toward the gate trying to appear casual A yellow pennant bearing the outline of a roaring lion and an arm holding a lily blossom waved over the entrance As they neared the wall Eragon asked in amazement How big is this place Larger than any city you have ever seen said Brom At the entrance to Teirm the guards stood straighter and blocked the gate with their pikes Whas yer name asked one of them in a bored tone Im called Neal said Brom in a wheezy voice slouching to one side an expression of happy idiocy on his face And whos th other one asked the guard Well I wus gettin to that Thised be mnephew Evan Hes msisters boy not a The guard nodded impatiently Yeah yeah And yer business here Hes visitin an old friend supplied Eragon dropping his voice into a thick accent Im along t make sure he dont get lost if y get mmeaning He aint as young as he used to behad a bit too much sun when he was youngr Touch o the brain fever y know Brom bobbed his head pleasantly Right Go on through said the guard waving his hand and dropping the pike Just make sure he doesnt cause any trouble Oh he wont promised Eragon He urged Cadoc forward and they rode into Teirm The cobblestone street clacked under the horses hooves Once they were away from the guards Brom sat up and growled Touch of brain fever eh I couldnt let you have all the fun teased Eragon Brom harrumphed and looked away The houses were grim and foreboding Small deep windows let in only sparse rays of light Narrow doors were recessed into the buildings The tops of the roofs were flatexcept for metal railingsand all were covered with slate shingles Eragon noticed that the houses closest to Teirms outer wall were no more than one story but the buildings got progressively higher as they went in Those next to the citadel were tallest of all though insignificant compared to the fortress This place looks ready for war said Eragon Brom nodded Teirm has a history of being attacked by pirates Urgals and other enemies It has long been a center of commerce There will always be conflict where riches gather in such abundance The people here have been forced to take extraordinary measures to keep themselves from being overrun It also helps that Galbatorix gives them soldiers to defend their city Why are some houses higher than others Look at the citadel said Brom pointing It has an unobstructed view of Teirm If the outer wall were breached archers would be posted on all the roofs Because the houses in the front by the outer wall are lower the men farther back could shoot over them without fear of hitting their comrades Also if the enemy were to capture those houses and put their own archers on them it would be an easy matter to shoot them down Ive never seen a city planned like this said Eragon in wonder Yes but it was only done after Teirm was nearly burned down by a pirate raid commented Brom As they continued up the street people gave them searching looks but there was not an undue amount of interest Compared to our reception at Daret weve been welcomed with open arms Perhaps Teirm has escaped notice by the Urgalsthought Eragon He changed his opinion when a large man shouldered past them a sword hanging from his waist There were other subtler signs of adverse times no children played in the streets people bore hard expressions and many houses were deserted with weeds growing from cracks in their stonecovered yards It looks like theyve had trouble said Eragon The same as everywhere else said Brom grimly We have to find Jeod They led their horses across the street to a tavern and tied them to the hitching post The Green Chestnut wonderful muttered Brom looking at the battered sign above them as he and Eragon entered the building The dingy room felt unsafe A fire smoldered in the fireplace yet no one bothered to throw more wood on it A few lonely people in the corners nursed their drinks with sullen expressions A man missing two fingers sat at a far table eyeing his twitching stumps The bartender had a cynical twist to his lips and held a glass in his hand that he kept polishing even though it was broken Brom leaned against the bar and asked Do you know where we can find a man called Jeod Eragon stood at his side fiddling with the tip of his bow by his waist It was slung across his back but right then he wished that it were in his hands The bartender said in an overly loud voice Now why would I know something like that Do you think I keep track of the mangy louts in this forsaken place Eragon winced as all eyes turned toward them Brom kept talking smoothly Could you be enticed to remember He slid some coins onto the bar The man brightened and put his glass down Could be he replied lowering his voice but my memory takes a great deal of prodding Broms face soured but he slid more coins onto the bar The bartender sucked on one side of his cheek undecidedly All right he finally said and reached for the coins Before he touched them the man missing two fingers called out from his table Gareth what in th blazes do you think youre doing Anyone on the street could tell them where Jeod lives What are you charging them for Brom swept the coins back into his purse Gareth shot a venomous look at the man at the table then turned his back on them and picked up the glass again Brom went to the stranger and said Thanks The names Neal This is Evan The man raised his mug to them Martin and of course you met Gareth His voice was deep and rough Martin gestured at some empty chairs Go ahead and sit down I dont mind Eragon took a chair and arranged it so his back was to the wall and he faced the door Martin raised an eyebrow but made no comment You just saved me a few crowns said Brom My pleasure Cant blame Gareth thoughbusiness hasnt been doing so well lately Martin scratched his chin Jeod lives on the west side of town right next to Angela the herbalist Do you have business with him Of a sort said Brom Well he wont be interested in buying anything he just lost another ship a few days ago Brom latched onto the news with interest What happened It wasnt Urgals was it No said Martin Theyve left the area No ones seen em in almost a year It seems theyve all gone south and east But they arent the problem See most of our business is through sea trade as Im sure you know Well he stopped to drink from his mug starting several months ago someones been attacking our ships Its not the usual piracy because only ships that carry the goods of certain merchants are attacked Jeods one of em Its gotten so bad that no captain will accept those merchants goods which makes life difficult around here Especially because some of em run the largest shipping businesses in the Empire Theyre being forced to send goods by land Its driven costs painfully high and their caravans dont always make it Do you have any idea whos responsible There must be witnesses said Brom Martin shook his head No one survives the attacks Ships go out then disappear theyre never seen again He leaned toward them and said in a confidential tone The sailors are saying that its magic He nodded and winked then leaned back Brom seemed worried by his words What do you think Martin shrugged carelessly I dont know And I dont think I will unless Im unfortunate enough to be on one of those captured ships Are you a sailor asked Eragon No snorted Martin Do I look like one The captains hire me to defend their ships against pirates And those thieving scum havent been very active lately Still its a good job But a dangerous one said Brom Martin shrugged again and downed the last of his beer Brom and Eragon took their leave and headed to the west side of the city a nicer section of Teirm The houses were clean ornate and large The people in the streets wore expensive finery and walked with authority Eragon felt conspicuous and out of place A NOLDFRIEND The herbalists shop had a cheery sign and was easy to find A short curlyhaired woman sat by the door She was holding a frog in one hand and writing with the other Eragon assumed that she was Angela the herbalist On either side of the store was a house Which one do you think is his he asked Brom deliberated then said Lets find out He approached the woman and asked politely Could you tell us which house Jeod lives in I could She continued writing Will you tell us Yes She fell silent but her pen scribbled faster than ever The frog on her hand croaked and looked at them with baleful eyes Brom and Eragon waited uncomfortably but she said no more Eragon was about to blurt something out when Angela looked up Of course Ill tell you All you have to do is ask Your first question was whether or not Icould tell you and the second was if Iwould tell you But you never actually put the question to me Then let me ask properly said Brom with a smile Which house is Jeods And why are you holding a frog Now were getting somewhere she bantered Jeod is on the right And as for the frog hes actually a toad Im trying to prove that toads dont existthat there are only frogs How can toads not exist if you have one on your hand right now interrupted Eragon Besides what good will it do proving that there are only frogs The woman shook her head vigorously dark curls bouncing No no you dont understand If I prove toads dont exist then this is a frog and never was a toad Therefore the toad you see now doesnt exist And she raised a small finger if I can prove there are only frogs then toads wont be able to do anything badlike make teeth fall out cause warts and poison or kill people Also witches wont be able to use any of their evil spells because of course there wont be any toads around I see said Brom delicately It sounds interesting and I would like to hear more but we have to meet Jeod Of course she said waving her hand and returning to her writing Once they were out of the herbalists hearing Eragon said Shes crazy Its possible said Brom but you never know She might discover something useful so dont criticize Who knows toads might really be frogs And my shoes are made of gold retorted Eragon They stopped before a door with a wroughtiron knocker and marble doorstep Brom banged three times No one answered Eragon felt slightly foolish Maybe this is the wrong house Lets try the other one he said Brom ignored him and knocked again pounding loudly Again no one answered Eragon turned away in exasperation then heard someone run to the door A young woman with a pale complexion and light blond hair cracked it open Her eyes were puffy it looked like she had been crying but her voice was perfectly steady Yes what do you want Does Jeod live here asked Brom kindly The woman dipped her head a little Yes he is my husband Is he expecting you She opened the door no farther No but we need to talk with him said Brom He is very busy We have traveled far Its very important that we see him Her face hardened He is busy Brom bristled but his voice stayed pleasant Since he is unavailable would you please give him a message Her mouth twitched but she consented Tell him that a friend from Gilead is waiting outside The woman seemed suspicious but said Very well She closed the door abruptly Eragon heard her footsteps recede That wasnt very polite he commented Keep your opinions to yourself snapped Brom And dont say anything Let me do the talking He crossed his arms and tapped his fingers Eragon clamped his mouth shut and looked away The door suddenly flew open and a tall man burst out of the house His expensive clothes were rumpled his gray hair wispy and he had a mournful face with short eyebrows A long scar stretched across his scalp to his temple At the sight of them his eyes grew wide and he sagged against the doorframe speechless His mouth opened and closed several times like a gasping fish He asked softly in an incredulous voice Brom Brom put a finger to his lips and reached forward clasping the mans arm Its good to see you Jeod Im glad that memory has not failed you but dont use that name It would be unfortunate if anyone knew I was here Jeod looked around wildly shock plain on his face I thought you were dead he whispered What happened Why havent you contacted me before All things will be explained Do you have a place where we can talk safely Jeod hesitated swinging his gaze between Eragon and Brom face unreadable Finally he said We cant talk here but if you wait a moment Ill take you somewhere we can Fine said Brom Jeod nodded and vanished behind the door I hope I can learn something of Broms pastthought Eragon There was a rapier at Jeods side when he reappeared An embroidered jacket hung loosely on his shoulders matched by a plumed hat Brom cast a critical eye at the finery and Jeod shrugged selfconsciously He took them through Teirm toward the citadel Eragon led the horses behind the two men Jeod gestured at their destination Risthart the lord of Teirm has decreed that all the business owners must have their headquarters in his castle Even though most of us conduct our business elsewhere we still have to rent rooms there Its nonsense but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm Well be free of eavesdroppers in there the walls are thick They went through the fortresss main gate and into the keep Jeod strode to a side door and pointed to an iron ring You can tie the horses there No one will bother them When Snowfire and Cadoc were safely tethered he opened the door with an iron key and let them inside Within was a long empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls Eragon was surprised by how cold and damp it was When he touched the wall his fingers slid over a layer of slime He shivered Jeod snatched a torch from its bracket and led them down the hall They stopped before a heavy wooden door He unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a bearskin rug laden with stuffed chairs Bookshelves stacked with leatherbound tomes covered the walls Jeod piled wood in the fireplace then thrust the torch under it The fire quickly roared You old man have some explaining to do Broms face crinkled with a smile Who are you calling an old man The last time I saw you there was no gray in your hair Now it looks like its in the final stages of decomposition And you look the same as you did nearly twenty years ago Time seems to have preserved you as a crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation Enough of this Get on with the story Thats always what you were good at said Jeod impatiently Eragons ears pricked up and he waited eagerly to hear what Brom would say Brom relaxed into a chair and pulled out his pipe He slowly blew a smoke ring that turned green darted into the fireplace then flew up the chimney Do you remember what we were doing in Gilead Yes of course said Jeod That sort of thing is hard to forget An understatement but true nevertheless said Brom dryly When we were separated I couldnt find you In the midst of the turmoil I stumbled into a small room There wasnt anything extraordinary in itjust crates and boxesbut out of curiosity I rummaged around anyway Fortune smiled on me that hour for I found what we had been searching for An expression of shock ran over Jeods face Once it was in my hands I couldnt wait for you At any second I might have been discovered and all lost Disguising myself as best I could I fled the city and ran to the Brom hesitated and glanced at Eragon then said ran to our friends They stored it in a vault for safekeeping and made me promise to care for whomever received it Until the day when my skills would be needed I had to disappear No one could know that I was alivenot even youthough it grieved me to pain you unnecessarily So I went north and hid in Carvahall Eragon clenched his jaw infuriated that Brom was deliberately keeping him in the dark Jeod frowned and asked Then our friends knew that you were alive all along Yes He sighed I suppose the ruse was unavoidable though I wish they had told me Isnt Carvahall farther north on the other side of the Spine Brom inclined his head For the first time Jeod inspected Eragon His gray eyes took in every detail He raised his eyebrows and said I assume then that you are fulfilling your duty Brom shook his head No its not that simple It was stolen a while agoat least thats what I presume for I havent received word from our friends and I suspect their messengers were waylaidso I decided to find out what I could Eragon happened to be traveling in the same direction We have stayed together for a time now Jeod looked puzzled But if they havent sent any messages how could you know that it was Brom overrode him quickly saying Eragons uncle was brutally killed by the Razac They burned his home and nearly caught him in the process He deserves revenge but they have left us without a trail to follow and we need help finding them Jeods face cleared I see But why have you come here I dont know where the Razac might be hiding and anyone who does wont tell you Standing Brom reached into his robe and pulled out the Razacs flask He tossed it to Jeod Theres Seithr oil in therethe dangerous kind The Razac were carrying it They lost it by the trail and we happened to find it We need to see Teirms shipping records so we can trace the Empires purchases of the oil That should tell us where the Razacs lair is Lines appeared on Jeods face as he thought He pointed at the books on the shelves Do you see those They are all records from my businessOne business You have gotten yourself into a project that could take months There is another greater problem The records you seek are held in this castle but only Brand Ristharts administrator of trade sees them on a regular basis Traders such as myself arent allowed to handle them They fear that we will falsify the results thus cheating the Empire of its precious taxes I can deal with that when the time comes said Brom But we need a few days of rest before we can think about proceeding Jeod smiled It seems that it is my turn to help you My house is yours of course Do you have another name while you are here Yes said Brom Im Neal and the boy is Evan Eragon said Jeod thoughtfully You have a unique name Few have ever been named after the first Rider In my life Ive read about only three people who were called such Eragon was startled that Jeod knew the origin of his name Brom looked at Eragon Could you go check on the horses and make sure theyre all right I dont think I tied Snowfire to the ring tightly enough Theyre trying to hide something from me The moment I leave theyre going to talk about itEragon shoved himself out of the chair and left the room slamming the door shut Snowfire had not moved the knot that held him was fine Scratching the horses necks Eragon leaned sullenly against the castle wall Its not fairhe complained to himselfIf only I could hear what they are saying He jolted upright electrified Brom had once taught him some words that would enhance his hearingKeen ears arent exactly what I want but I should be able to make the words work After all look what I could do with brisingr He concentrated intensely and reached for his power Once it was within his grasp he said Thverr stenr un atra eka hórna and imbued the words with his will As the power rushed out of him he heard a faint whisper in his ears but nothing more Disappointed he sank back then started as Jeod said and Ive been doing that for almost eight years now Eragon looked around No one was there except for a few guards standing against the far wall of the keep Grinning he sat on the courtyard and closed his eyes I never expected you to become a merchant said Brom After all the time you spent in books And finding the passageway in that manner What made you take up trading instead of remaining a scholar After Gilead I didnt have much taste for sitting in musty rooms and reading scrolls I decided to help Ajihad as best I could but Im no warrior My father was a merchant as wellyou may remember that He helped me get started However the bulk of my business is nothing more than a front to get goods into Surda But I take it that things have been going badly said Brom Yes none of the shipments have gotten through lately and Tronjheim is running low on supplies Somehow the Empireat least I think its themhas discovered those of us who have been helping to support Tronjheim But Im still not convinced that its the Empire No one sees any soldiers I dont understand it Perhaps Galbatorix hired mercenaries to harass us I heard that you lost a ship recently The last one I owned answered Jeod bitterly Every man on it was loyal and brave I doubt Ill ever see them again The only option I have left is to send caravans to Surda or Gileadwhich I know wont get there no matter how many guards I hireor charter someone elses ship to carry the goods But no one will take them now How many merchants have been helping you asked Brom Oh a good number up and down the seaboard All of them have been plagued by the same troubles I know what you are thinking Ive pondered it many a night myself but I can not bear the thought of a traitor with that much knowledge and power If there is one were all in jeopardy You should return to Tronjheim And take Eragon there interrupted Brom Theyd tear him apart Its the worst place he could be right now Maybe in a few months or even better a year Can you imagine how the dwarves will react Everyone will be trying to influence him especially Islanzadi He and Saphira wont be safe in Tronjheim until I at least get them through tuatha du orothrim Dwarvesthought Eragon excitedlyWhere is this Tronjheim And why did he tell Jeod about Saphira He shouldnt have done that without asking me Still I have a feeling that they are in need of your power and wisdom Wisdom snorted Brom Im just what you said earliera crotchety old man Many would disagree Let them Ive no need to explain myself No Ajihad will have to get along without me What Im doing now is much more important But the prospect of a traitor raises troubling questions I wonder if thats how the Empire knew where to be His voice trailed off And I wonder why I havent been contacted about this said Jeod Maybe they tried But if theres a traitor Brom paused I have to send word to Ajihad Do you have a messenger you can trust I think so said Jeod It depends on where he would have to go I dont know said Brom Ive been isolated so long my contacts have probably died or forgotten me Could you send him to whoever receives your shipments Yes but itll be risky What isnt these days How soon can he leave He can go in the morning Ill send him to Gilead It will be faster said Jeod What can he take to convince Ajihad the message comes from you Here give your man my ring And tell him that if he loses it Ill personally tear his liver out It was given to me by the queen Arent you cheery commented Jeod Brom grunted After a long silence he said Wed better go out and join Eragon I get worried when hes alone That boy has an unnatural propensity for being wherever theres trouble Are you surprised Not really Eragon heard chairs being pushed back He quickly pulled his mind away and opened his eyes Whats going on he muttered to himselfJeod and other traders are in trouble for helping people the Empire doesnt favor Brom found something in Gilead and went to Carvahall to hide What could be so important that he would let his own friend think he was dead for nearly twenty years He mentioned a queenwhen there arent any queens in the known kingdomsand dwarves who as he himself told me disappeared underground long ago He wanted answers But he would not confront Brom now and risk jeopardizing their mission No he would wait until they left Teirm and then he would persist until the old man explained his secrets Eragons thoughts were still whirling when the door opened Were the horses all right asked Brom Fine said Eragon They untied the horses and left the castle As they reentered the main body of Teirm Brom said So Jeod you finally got married And he winked slyly to a lovely young woman Congratulations Jeod did not seem happy with the compliment He hunched his shoulders and stared down at the street Whether congratulations are in order is debatable right now Helen isnt very happy Why What does she want asked Brom The usual said Jeod with a resigned shrug A good home happy children food on the table and pleasant company The problem is that she comes from a wealthy family her father has invested heavily in my business If I keep suffering these losses there wont be enough money for her to live the way shes used to Jeod continued But please my troubles are not your troubles A host should never bother his guests with his own concerns While you are in my house I will let nothing more than an overfull stomach disturb you Thank you said Brom We appreciate the hospitality Our travels have long been without comforts of any kind Do you happen to know where we could find an inexpensive shop All this riding has worn out our clothes Of course Thats my job said Jeod lightening up He talked eagerly about prices and stores until his house was in sight Then he asked Would you mind if we went somewhere else to eat It might be awkward if you came in right now Whatever makes you feel comfortable said Brom Jeod looked relieved Thanks Lets leave your horses in my stable They did as he suggested then followed him to a large tavern Unlike the Green Chestnut this one was loud clean and full of boisterous people When the main course arriveda stuffed suckling pigEragon eagerly dug into the meat but he especially savored the potatoes carrots turnips and sweet apples that accompanied it It had been a long time since he had eaten much more than wild game They lingered over the meal for hours as Brom and Jeod swapped stories Eragon did not mind He was warm a lively tune jangled in the background and there was more than enough food The spirited tavern babble fell pleasantly on his ears When they finally exited the tavern the sun was nearing the horizon You two go ahead I have to check on something Eragon said He wanted to see Saphira and make sure that she was safely hidden Brom agreed absently Be careful Dont take too long Wait said Jeod Are you going outside Teirm Eragon hesitated then reluctantly nodded Make sure youre inside the walls before dark The gates close then and the guards wont let you back in until morning I wont be late promised Eragon He turned around and loped down a side street toward Teirms outer wall Once out of the city he breathed deeply enjoying the fresh airSaphira he calledWhere are you She guided him off the road to the base of a mossy cliff surrounded by maples He saw her head poke out of the trees on the top and wavedHow am I supposed to get up there If you find a clearing Ill come down and get you Nohe said eyeing the cliffthat wont be necessaryIll just climb up Its too dangerous And you worry too much Let me have some fun Eragon pulled off his gloves and started climbing He relished the physical challenge There were plenty of handholds so the ascent was easy He was soon high above the trees Halfway up he stopped on a ledge to catch his breath Once his strength returned he stretched up for the next handhold but his arm was not long enough Stymied he searched for another crevice or ridge to grasp There was none He tried backing down but his legs could not reach his last foothold Saphira watched with unblinking eyes He gave up and saidI could use some help This is your own fault Yes I know Are you going to get me down or not If I werent around you would be in a very bad situation Eragon rolled his eyesYou dont have to tell me Youre right After all how can a mere dragon expect to tell a man like yourself what to do In fact everyone should stand in awe of your brilliance of finding the only dead end Why if you had started a few feet in either direction the path to the top would have been clearShe cocked her head at him eyes bright All right I made a mistake Now can you please get me out of herehe pleaded She pulled her head back from the edge of the cliff After a moment he called Saphira Above him were only swaying trees Saphira Come back he roared With a loud crash Saphira barreled off the top of the cliff flipping around in midair She floated down to Eragon like a huge bat and grabbed his shirt with her claws scratching his back He let go of the rocks as she yanked him up in the air After a brief flight she set him down gently on the top of the cliff and tugged her claws out of his shirt Foolishnesssaid Saphira gently Eragon looked away studying the landscape The cliff provided a wonderful view of their surroundings especially the foaming sea as well as protection against unwelcome eyes Only birds would see Saphira here It was an ideal location Is Broms friend trustworthyshe asked I dont knowEragon proceeded to recount the days eventsThere are forces circling us that we arent aware of Sometimes I wonder if we can ever understand the true motives of the people around us They all seem to have secrets It is the way of the world Ignore all the schemes and trust in the nature of each person Brom is good He means us no harm We dont have to fear his plans I hope sohe said looking down at his hands This finding of the Razac through writing is a strange way of trackingshe remarkedWould there be a way to use magic to see the records without being inside the room Im not sure You would have to combine the word forseeingwithdistance or maybelightanddistanceEither way it seems rather difficult Ill ask Brom That would be wiseThey lapsed into tranquil silence You know we may have to stay here awhile Saphiras answer held a hard edgeAnd as always I will be left to wait outside That is not how I want it Soon enough we will travel together again May that day come quickly Eragon smiled and hugged her He noticed then how rapidly the light was fadingI have to go now before Im locked out of Teirm Hunt tomorrow and I will see you in the evening She spread her wingsCome I will take you down He got onto her scaly back and held on tightly as she launched off the cliff glided over the trees then landed on a knoll Eragon thanked her and ran back to Teirm He came into sight of the portcullis just as it was beginning to lower Calling for them to wait he put on a burst of speed and slipped inside seconds before the gateway slammed closed Ya cut that a little close observed one of the guards It wont happen again assured Eragon bending over to catch his breath He wound his way through the darkened city to Jeods house A lantern hung outside like a beacon A plump butler answered his knock and ushered him inside without a word Tapestries covered the stone walls Elaborate rugs dotted the polished wood floor which glowed with the light from three gold candelabra hanging from the ceiling Smoke drifted through the air and collected above This way sir Your friend is in the study They passed scores of doorways until the butler opened one to reveal a study Books covered the rooms walls But unlike those in Jeods office these came in every size and shape A fireplace filled with blazing logs warmed the room Brom and Jeod sat before an oval writing desk talking amiably Brom raised his pipe and said in a jovial voice Ah here you are We were getting worried about you How was your walk I wonder what put him in such a good mood Why doesnt he just come out and ask how Saphira isPleasant but the guards almost locked me outside the city And Teirm is big I had trouble finding this house Jeod chuckled When you have seen DrasLeona Gilead or even Kuasta you wont be so easily impressed by this small ocean city I like it here though When its not raining Teirm is really quite beautiful Eragon turned to Brom Do you have any idea how long well be here Brom spread his palms upward Thats hard to tell It depends on whether we can get to the records and how long it will take us to find what we need Well all have to help it will be a huge job Ill talk with Brand tomorrow and see if hell let us examine the records I dont think Ill be able to help Eragon said shifting uneasily Why not asked Brom There will be plenty of work for you Eragon lowered his head I cant read Brom straightened with disbelief You mean Garrow never taught you He knew how to read asked Eragon puzzled Jeod watched them with interest Of course he did snorted Brom The proud foolwhat was he thinking I should have realized that he wouldnt have taught you He probably considered it an unnecessary luxury Brom scowled and pulled at his beard angrily This sets my plans back but not irreparably Ill just have to teach you how to read It wont take long if you put your mind to it Eragon winced Broms lessons were usually intense and brutally directHow much more can I learn at one time I suppose its necessary he said ruefully Youll enjoy it There is much you can learn from books and scrolls said Jeod He gestured at the walls These books are my friends my companions They make me laugh and cry and find meaning in life It sounds intriguing admitted Eragon Always the scholar arent you asked Brom Jeod shrugged Not anymore Im afraid Ive degenerated into a bibliophile A what asked Eragon One who loves books explained Jeod and resumed conversing with Brom Bored Eragon scanned the shelves An elegant book set with gold studs caught his attention He pulled it off the shelf and stared at it curiously It was bound in black leather carved with mysterious runes Eragon ran his fingers over the cover and savored its cool smoothness The letters inside were printed with a reddish glossy ink He let the pages slip past his fingers A column of script set off from the regular lettering caught his eye The words were long and flowing full of graceful lines and sharp points Eragon took the book to Brom What is this he asked pointing to the strange writing Brom looked at the page closely and raised his eyebrows in surprise Jeod youve expanded your collection Where did you get this I havent seen one in ages Jeod strained his neck to see the book Ah yes theDomia abr Wyrda A man came through here a few years ago and tried to sell it to a trader down by the wharves Fortunately I happened to be there and was able to save the book along with his neck He didnt have a clue what it was Its odd Eragon that you should pick up this book theDominance of Fate said Brom Of all the items in this house its probably worth the most It details a complete history of Alagaësiastarting long before the elves landed here and ending a few decades ago The book is very rare and is the best of its kind When it was written the Empire decried it as blasphemy and burned the author Heslant the Monk I didnt think any copies still existed The lettering you asked about is from the ancient language What does it say asked Eragon It took Brom a moment to read the writing Its part of an elven poem that tells of the years they fought the dragons This excerpt describes one of their kings Ceranthor as he rides into battle The elves love this poem and tell it regularlythough you need three days to do it properlyso that they wont repeat the mistakes of the past At times they sing it so beautifully it seems the very rocks will cry Eragon returned to his chair holding the book gentlyIts amazing that a man who is dead can talk to people through these pages As long as this book survives his ideas live I wonder if it contains any information about the Razac He browsed through the book while Brom and Jeod spoke Hours passed and Eragon began to drowse Out of pity for his exhaustion Jeod bid them good night The butler will show you to your rooms On the way upstairs the servant said If you need assistance use the bellpull next to the bed He stopped before a cluster of three doors bowed then backed away As Brom entered the room on the right Eragon asked Can I talk to you You just did but come in anyway Eragon closed the door behind himself Saphira and I had an idea Is there Brom stopped him with a raised hand and pulled the curtains shut over the window When you talk of such things you would do well to make sure that no unwelcome ears are present Sorry said Eragon berating himself for the slip Anyway is it possible to conjure up an image of something that you cant see Brom sat on the edge of his bed What you are talking about is called scrying It is quite possible and extremely helpful in some situations but it has a major drawback You can only observe people places and things that youve already seen If you were to scry the Razac youd see them all right but not their surroundings There are other problems as well Lets say that you wanted to view a page in a book one that youd already seen You could only see the page if the book were open to it If the book were closed when you tried this the page would appear completely black Why cant you view objects that you havent seen asked Eragon Even with those limitations he realized scrying could be very usefulI wonder if I could view something leagues away and use magic to affect what was happening there Because said Brom patiently to scry you have to know what youre looking at and where to direct your power Even if a stranger was described to you it would still be nigh impossible to view him not to mention the ground and whatever else might be around him You have to knowwhat youre going to scry before youcan scry it Does that answer your question Eragon thought for a moment But how is it done Do you conjure up the image in thin air Not usually said Brom shaking his white head That takes more energy than projecting it onto a reflective surface like a pool of water or a mirror Some Riders used to travel everywhere they could trying to see as much as possible Then whenever war or some other calamity occurred they would be able to view events throughout Alagaësia May I try it asked Eragon Brom looked at him carefully No not now Youre tired and scrying takes lots of strength I will tell you the words but you must promise not to attempt it tonight And Id rather you wait until we leave Teirm I have more to teach you Eragon smiled I promise Very well Brom bent over and very quietly whispered Draumr kópa into Eragons ear Eragon took a moment to memorize the words Maybe after weve left Teirm I can scry Roran I would like to know how hes doing Im afraid that the Razac might go after him I dont mean to frighten you but thats a distinct possibility said Brom Although Roran was gone most of the time the Razac were in Carvahall Im sure that they asked questions about him Who knows they may have even met him while they were in Therinsford Either way I doubt their curiosity is sated Youre on the loose after all and the king is probably threatening them with terrible punishment if you arent found If they get frustrated enough theyll go back and interrogate Roran Its only a matter of time If thats true then the only way to keep Roran safe is to let the Razac know where I am so that theyll come after me instead of him No that wont work either Youre not thinking admonished Brom If you cant understand your enemies how can you expect to anticipate them Even if you exposed your location the Razac wouldstill chase Roran Do you know why Eragon straightened and tried to consider every possibility Well if I stay in hiding long enough they might get frustrated and capture Roran to force me to reveal myself If that didnt work theyd kill him just to hurt me Also if I become a public enemy of the Empire they might use him as bait to catch me And if I met with Roran and they found out about it they would torture him to find out where I was Very good You figured that out quite nicely said Brom But whats the solution I cant let him be killed Brom clasped his hands loosely The solution is quite obvious Roran is going to have to learn how to defend himself That may sound hardhearted but as you pointed out you can not risk meeting with him You may not remember thisyou were half delirious at the timebut when we left Carvahall I told you that I had left a warning letter for Roran so he wont be totally unprepared for danger If he has any sense at all when the Razac show up in Carvahall again hell take my advice and flee I dont like this said Eragon unhappily Ah but you forget something What he demanded There is some good in all of this The king can not afford to have a Rider roaming around that he does not control Galbatorix is the only known Rider alive besides yourself but he would like another one under his command Before he tries to kill you or Roran he will offer you the chance to serve him Unfortunately if he ever gets close enough to make that proposition it will be far too late for you to refuse and still live You call that some good Its all thats protecting Roran As long as the king doesnt know which side youve chosen he wont risk alienating you by harming your cousin Keep that firmly in mind The Razac killed Garrow but I think it was an illconsidered decision on their part From what I know of Galbatorix he would not have approved it unless he gained something from it And how will I be able to deny the kings wishes when he is threatening me with death asked Eragon sharply Brom sighed He went to his nightstand and dipped his fingers in a basin of rose water Galbatorix wants your willing cooperation Without that youre worse than useless to him So the question becomes If you are ever faced with this choice are you willing to die for what you believe in For that is the only way you will deny him The question hung in the air Brom finally said Its a difficult question and not one you can answer until youre faced with it Keep in mind that many people have died for their beliefs its actually quite common The real courage is in living and suffering for what you believe T HEWITCH ANDTHEWERECAT It was late in the morning when Eragon woke He dressed washed his face in the basin then held the mirror up and brushed his hair into place Something about his reflection made him stop and look closer His face had changed since he had run out of Carvahall just a short while ago Any baby fat was gone now stripped away by traveling sparring and training His cheekbones were more prominent and the line of his jaw was sharper There was a slight cast to his eyes that when he looked closely gave his face a wild alien appearance He held the mirror at arms length and his face resumed its normal semblancebut it still did not seem quite his own A little disturbed he slung his bow and quiver across his back then left the room Before he had reached the end of the hall the butler caught up with him and said Sir Neal left with my master for the castle earlier He said that you could do whatever you want today because he will not return until this evening Eragon thanked him for the message then eagerly began exploring Teirm For hours he wandered the streets entering every shop that struck his fancy and chatting with various people Eventually he was forced back to Jeods by his empty stomach and lack of money When he reached the street where the merchant lived he stopped at the herbalists shop next door It was an unusual place for a store The other shops were down by the city wall not crammed between expensive houses He tried to look in the windows but they were covered with a thick layer of crawling plants on the interior Curious he went inside At first he saw nothing because the store was so dark but then his eyes adjusted to the faint greenish light that filtered through the windows A colorful bird with wide tail feathers and a sharp powerful beak looked at Eragon inquisitively from a cage near the window The walls were covered with plants vines clung to the ceiling obscuring all but an old chandelier and on the floor was a large pot with a yellow flower A collection of mortars pestles metal bowls and a clear crystal ball the size of Eragons head rested on a long counter He walked to the counter carefully stepping around complex machines crates of rocks piles of scrolls and other objects he did not recognize The wall behind the counter was covered with drawers of every size Some of them were no larger than his smallest finger while others were big enough for a barrel There was a footwide gap in the shelves far above A pair of red eyes suddenly flashed from the dark space and a large fierce cat leapt onto the counter It had a lean body with powerful shoulders and oversized paws A shaggy mane surrounded its angular face its ears were tipped with black tufts White fangs curved down over its jaw Altogether it did not look like any cat Eragon had ever seen It inspected him with shrewd eyes then flicked its tail dismissively On a whim Eragon reached out with his mind and touched the cats consciousness Gently he prodded it with his thoughts trying to make it understand that he was a friend You dont have to do that Eragon looked around in alarm The cat ignored him and licked a pawSaphira Where are you he asked No one answered Puzzled he leaned against the counter and reached for what looked like a wood rod That wouldnt be wise Stop playing games Saphirahe snapped then picked up the rod A shock of electricity exploded through his body and he fell to the floor writhing The pain slowly faded leaving him gasping for air The cat jumped down and looked at him You arent very smart for a Dragon Rider I did warn you You said thatexclaimed Eragon The cat yawned then stretched and sauntered across the floor weaving its way between objects Who else But youre just a cathe objected The cat yowled and stalked back to him It jumped on his chest and crouched there looking down at him with gleaming eyes Eragon tried to sit up but it growled showing its fangsDo I look like other cats No Then what makes you think I am oneEragon started to say something but the creature dug its claws into his chestObviously your education has been neglected Ito correct your mistakeam a werecat There arent many of us left but I think even a farm boy should have heard of us I didnt know you were realsaid Eragon fascinated A werecat He was indeed fortunate They were always flitting around the edges of stories keeping to themselves and occasionally giving advice If the legends were true they had magical powers lived longer than humans and usually knew more than they told The werecat blinked lazilyKnowing is independent of being I did not know you existed before you bumbled in here and ruined my nap Yet that doesnt mean you werent real before you woke me Eragon was lost by its reasoningIm sorry I disturbed you I was getting up anywayit said It leapt back onto the counter and licked its pawIf I were you I wouldnt hold on to that rod much longer Its going to shock you again in a few seconds He hastily put the rod back where he had found itWhat is it A common and boring artifact unlike myself But whats it for Didnt you find outThe werecat finished cleaning its paw stretched once more then jumped back up to its sleeping place It sat down tucked its paws under its breast and closed its eyes purring Waitsaid Eragonwhats your name One of the werecats slanted eyes cracked openI go by many names If you are looking for my proper one you will have to seek elsewhere The eye closed Eragon gave up and turned to leaveHowever you may call me Solembum Thank yousaid Eragon seriously Solembums purring grew louder The door to the shop swung open letting in a beam of sunlight Angela entered with a cloth bag full of plants Her eyes flickered at Solembum and she looked startled He says you talked with him You can talk with him too asked Eragon She tossed her head Of course but that doesnt mean hell say anything back She set her plants on the counter then walked behind it and faced him He likes you Thats unusual Most of the time Solembum doesnt show himself to customers In fact he says that you show some promise given a few years of work Thanks Its a compliment coming from him Youre only the third person to come in here who has been able to speak with him The first was a woman many years ago the second was a blind beggar and now you But I dont run a store just so I can prattle on Is there anything you want Or did you only come in to look Just to look said Eragon still thinking about the werecat Besides I dont really need any herbs Thats not all I do said Angela with a grin The rich fool lords pay me for love potions and the like I never claim that they work but for some reason they keep coming back But I dont think you need those chicaneries Would you like your fortune told I do that too for all the rich fool ladies Eragon laughed No Im afraid my fortune is pretty much unreadable And I dont have any money Angela looked at Solembum curiously I think She gestured at the crystal ball resting on the counter Thats only for show anywayit doesnt do anything But I do have Wait here Ill be right back She hurried into a room at the back of the shop She came back breathless holding a leather pouch which she set on the counter I havent used these for so long I almost forgot where they were Now sit across from me and Ill show you why I went to all this trouble Eragon found a stool and sat Solembums eyes glowed from the gap in the drawers Angela laid a thick cloth on the counter then poured a handful of smooth bones each slightly longer than a finger onto it Runes and symbols were inscribed along their sides These she said touching them gently are the knucklebones of a dragon Dont ask where I got them it is a secret I wont reveal But unlike tea leaves crystal balls or even divining cards these have true power They do not lie though understanding what they say is complicated If you wish I will cast and read them for you But understand that to know ones fate can be a terrible thing You must be sure of your decision Eragon looked at the bones with a feeling of dreadThere lies what was once one of Saphiras kin To know ones fate How can I make this decision when I dont know what lies in wait for me and whether I will like itIgnorance is indeed bliss Why do you offer this he asked Because of Solembum He may have been rude but the fact that he spoke to you makes you special Heis a werecat after all I offered to do this for the other two people who talked with him Only the woman agreed to it Selena was her name Ah she regretted it too Her fortune was bleak and painful I dont think she believed itnot at first Emotion overcame Eragon bringing tears to his eyes Selena he whispered to himself His mothers nameCould it have been her Was her destiny so horrible that she had to abandon me Do you remember anything about her fortune he asked feeling sick Angela shook her head and sighed It was so long ago that the details have melted into the rest of my memory which isnt as good as it used to be Besides Ill not tell you what I do remember That was for her and her alone It was sad though Ive never forgotten the look on her face Eragon closed his eyes and struggled to regain control of his emotions Why do you complain about your memory he asked to distract himself Youre not that old Dimples appeared on Angelas cheeks Im flattered but dont be deceived Im much older than I look The appearance of youth probably comes from having to eat my own herbs when times are lean Smiling Eragon took a deep breathIf that was my mother and she could bear to have her fortune told I can too Cast the bones for me he said solemnly Angelas face became grave as she grasped the bones in each hand Her eyes closed and her lips moved in a soundless murmur Then she said powerfullyManin Wyrda Hugin and tossed the bones onto the cloth They fell all jumbled together gleaming in the faint light The words rang in Eragons ears he recognized them from the ancient language and realized with apprehension that to use them for magic Angela must be a witch She had not lied this was a true fortunetelling Minutes slowly passed as she studied the bones Finally Angela leaned back and heaved a long sigh She wiped her brow and pulled out a wineskin from under the counter Do you want some she asked Eragon shook his head She shrugged and drank deeply This she said wiping her mouth is the hardest reading Ive ever done You were right Your future is nigh impossible to see Ive never known of anyones fate being so tangled and clouded I was however able to wrestle a few answers from it Solembum jumped onto the counter and settled there watching them both Eragon clenched his hands as Angela pointed to one of the bones I will start here she said slowly because it is the clearest to understand The symbol on the bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it Infinity or long life said Angela quietly This is the first time I have ever seen it come up in someones future Most of the time its the aspen or the elm both signs that a person will live a normal span of years Whether this means that you will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life Im not sure Whatever it foretells you may be sure that many years lie ahead of you No surprises thereI am a Riderthought Eragon Was Angela only going to tell him things he already knew Now the bones grow harder to read as the rest are in a confused pile Angela touched three of them Here the wandering path lightning bolt and sailing ship all lie togethera pattern Ive never seen only heard of The wandering path shows that there are many choices in your future some of which you face even now I see great battles raging around you some of them fought for your sake I see the mighty powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny Countless possible futures await youall of them filled with blood and conflictbut only one will bring you happiness and peace Beware of losing your way for you are one of the few who are truly free to choose their own fate That freedom is a gift but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains Then her face grew sad And yet as if to counteract that here is the lightning bolt It is a terrible omen There is a doom upon you but of what sort I know not Part of it lies in a deathone that rapidly approaches and will cause you much grief But the rest awaits in a great journey Look closely at this bone You can see how its end rests on that of the sailing ship That is impossible to misunderstand Your fate will be to leave this land forever Where you will end up I know not but you will never again stand in Alagaësia This is inescapable It will come to pass even if you try to avoid it Her words frightened EragonAnother death who must I lose now His thoughts immediately went to Roran Then he thought about his homelandWhat could ever force me to leaveAnd where would I go If there are lands across the sea or to the east only the elves know of them Angela rubbed her temples and breathed deeply The next bone is easier to read and perhaps a bit more pleasant Eragon examined it and saw a rose blossom inscribed between the horns of a crescent moon Angela smiled and said An epic romance is in your future extraordinary as the moon indicatesfor that is a magical symboland strong enough to outlast empires I can not say if this passion will end happily but your love is of noble birth and heritage She is powerful wise and beautiful beyond compare Of noble birththought Eragon in surpriseHow could that ever happen I have no more standing than the poorest of farmers Now for the last two bones the tree and the hawthorn root which cross each other strongly I wish that this were not soit can only mean more troublebut betrayal is clear And it will come from within your family Roran wouldnt do that objected Eragon abruptly I wouldnt know said Angela carefully But the bones have never lied and that is what they say Doubt wormed into Eragons mind but he tried to ignore it What reason would there ever be for Roran to turn on him Angela put a comforting hand on his shoulder and offered him the wineskin again This time Eragon accepted the drink and it made him feel better After all that death might be welcome he joked nervouslyBetrayal from Roran It couldnt happen It wont It might be said Angela solemnly then laughed slightly But you shouldnt fret about what has yet to occur The only way the future can harm us is by causing worry I guarantee that youll feel better once youre out in the sun PerhapsUnfortunately he reflected wrylynothing she said will make sense until it has already happened If it really does he amended himself You used words of power he noted quietly Angelas eyes flashed What I wouldnt give to see how the rest of your life plays out You can speak to werecats know of the ancient language and have a most interesting future Also few young men with empty pockets and rough traveling clothes can expect to be loved by a noblewoman Who are you Eragon realized that the werecat must not have told Angela that he was a Rider He almost said Evan but then changed his mind and simply stated I am Eragon Angela arched her eyebrows Is that who you are or your name she asked Both said Eragon with a small smile thinking of his namesake the first Rider Now Im all the more interested in seeing how your life will unfold Who was the ragged man with you yesterday Eragon decided that one more name couldnt hurt His name is Brom A guffaw suddenly burst out of Angela doubling her over in mirth She wiped her eyes and took a sip of wine then fought off another attack of merriment Finally gasping for breath she forced out Oh that one I had no idea What is it demanded Eragon No no dont be upset said Angela hiding a smile Its only thatwell he is known by those in my profession Im afraid that the poor mans doom or future if you will is something of a joke with us Dont insult him Hes a better man than any you could find snapped Eragon Peace peace chided Angela with amusement I know that If we meet again at the right time Ill be sure to tell you about it But in the meantime you should She stopped speaking as Solembum padded between them The werecat stared at Eragon with unblinking eyes YesEragon asked irritated Listen closely and I will tell you two things When the time comes and you need a weapon look under the roots of the Menoa tree Then when all seems lost and your power is insufficient go to the rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault of Souls Before Eragon could ask what Solembum meant the werecat walked away waving his tail ever so gracefully Angela tilted her head coils of dense hair shadowing her forehead I dont know what he said and I dont want to know He spoke to you and only you Dont tell anyone else I think I have to go said Eragon shaken If you want to said Angela smiling again You are welcome to stay here as long as you like especially if you buy some of my goods But go if you wish Im sure that weve given you enough to ponder for a while Yes Eragon quickly made his way to the door Thank you for reading my futureI think Youre welcome said Angela still smiling Eragon exited the shop and stood in the street squinting until his eyes adjusted to the brightness It was a few minutes before he could think calmly about what he had learned He started walking his steps unconsciously quickening until he dashed out of Teirm feet flying as he headed to Saphiras hiding place He called to her from the base of the cliff A minute later she soared down and bore him up to the cliff top When they were both safely on the ground Eragon told her about his dayAnd so he concludedI think Broms right I always seem to be where theres trouble You should remember what the werecat told you Its important How do you knowhe asked curiously Im not sure but the names he used feel powerfulKuthian she said rolling the word aroundNo we should not forget what he said Do you think I should tell Brom Its your choice but think of this he has no right to know your future To tell him of Solembum and his words will only raise questions you may not want to answer And if you decided to only ask him what those words mean he will want to know where you learned them Do you think you can lie convincingly to him Noadmitted EragonMaybe I wont say anything Still this might be too important to hide They talked until there was nothing more to say Then they sat together companionably watching the trees until dusk Eragon hurried back to Teirm and was soon knocking on Jeods door Is Neal back he asked the butler Yes sir I believe hes in the study right now Thank you said Eragon He strode to the room and peeked inside Brom was sitting before the fire smoking How did it go asked Eragon Bloody awful growled Brom around his pipe So you talked to Brand Not that it did any good Thisadministrator of trade is the worst sort of bureaucrat He abides by every rule delights in making his own whenever it can inconvenience someone and at the same time believes that hes doing good Then he wont let us see the records asked Eragon No snapped Brom exasperated Nothing I could say would sway him He even refused bribes Substantial ones too I didnt think I would ever meet a noble who wasnt corrupt Now that I have I find that I prefer them when theyre greedy bastards He puffed furiously on his pipe and mumbled a steady stream of curses When he seemed to have calmed Eragon asked tentatively So what now Im going to take the next week and teach you how to read And after that A smile split Broms face After that were going to give Brand a nasty surprise Eragon pestered him for details but Brom refused to say more Dinner was held in a sumptuous dining room Jeod sat at one end of the table a hardeyed Helen at the other Brom and Eragon were seated between them which Eragon felt was a dangerous place to be Empty chairs were on either side of him but he didnt mind the space It helped to protect him from the glares of their hostess The food was served quietly and Jeod and Helen wordlessly began eating Eragon followed suit thinkingIve had cheerier meals at funerals And he had in Carvahall He remembered many burials that had been sad yes but not unduly so This was different he could feel simmering resentment pouring from Helen throughout the dinner O FREADING ANDPLOTS Brom scratched a rune on parchment with charcoal then showed it to Eragon This is the lettera he said Learn it With that Eragon began the task of becoming literate It was difficult and strange and pushed his intellect to its limits but he enjoyed it Without anything else to do and with a goodif sometimes impatientteacher he advanced rapidly A routine was soon established Every day Eragon got up ate in the kitchen then went to the study for his lessons where he labored to memorize the sounds of the letters and the rules of writing It got so that when he closed his eyes letters and words danced in his mind He thought of little else during that time Before dinner he and Brom would go behind Jeods house and spar The servants along with a small crowd of wideeyed children would come and watch If there was any time afterward Eragon would practice magic in his room with the curtains securely closed His only worry was Saphira He visited her every evening but it was not enough time together for either of them During the day Saphira spent most of her time leagues away searching for food she could not hunt near Teirm without arousing suspicion Eragon did what he could to help her but he knew that the only solution for both her hunger and loneliness was to leave the city far behind Every day more grim news poured into Teirm Arriving merchants told of horrific attacks along the coast There were reports of powerful people disappearing from their houses in the night and their mangled corpses being discovered in the morning Eragon often heard Brom and Jeod discussing the events in an undertone but they always stopped when he came near The days passed quickly and soon a week had gone by Eragons skills were rudimentary but he could now read whole pages without asking Broms help He read slowly but he knew that speed would come with time Brom encouraged him No matter youll do fine for what I have planned It was afternoon when Brom summoned both Jeod and Eragon to the study Brom gestured at Eragon Now that you can help us I think its time to move ahead What do you have in mind asked Eragon A fierce smile danced on Broms face Jeod groaned I know that look its what got us into trouble in the first place A slight exaggeration said Brom but not unwarranted Very well this is what well do We leave tonight or tomorrowEragon told Saphira from within his room This is unexpected Will you be safe during this venture Eragon shruggedI dont know We may end up fleeing Teirm with soldiers on our heels He felt her worry and tried to reassure herItll be all right Brom and I can use magic and were good fighters He lay on the bed and stared at the ceiling His hands shook slightly and there was a lump in his throat As sleep overcame him he felt a wave of confusionI dont want to leave Teirm he suddenly realizedThe time Ive spent here has beenalmost normal What I would give not to keep uprooting myself To stay here and be like everyone else would be wonderful Then another thought raged through himBut Ill never be able to while Saphira is around Never Dreams owned his consciousness twisting and directing it to their whims At times he quaked with fear at others he laughed with pleasure Then something changedit was as though his eyes had been opened for the first timeand a dream came to him that was clearer than any before He saw a young woman bent over by sorrow chained in a cold hard cell A beam of moonlight shone through a barred window set high in the wall and fell on her face A single tear rolled down her cheek like a liquid diamond Eragon rose with a start and found himself crying uncontrollably before sinking back into a fitful sleep T HIEVES IN THECASTLE Eragon woke from his nap to a golden sunset Red and orange beams of light streamed into the room and fell across the bed They warmed his back pleasantly making him reluctant to move He dozed but the sunlight crept off him and he grew cold The sun sank below the horizon lighting the sea and sky with colorAlmost time He slung his bow and quiver on his back but left Zarroc in the room the sword would only slow him and he was averse to using it If he had to disable someone he could use magic or an arrow He pulled his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely He waited nervously in his room until the light faded Then he entered the hallway and shrugged so the quiver settled comfortably across his back Brom joined him carrying his sword and staff Jeod dressed in a black doublet and hose was waiting for them outside From his waist swung an elegant rapier and a leather pouch Brom eyed the rapier and observed That toad sticker is too thin for any real fighting What will you do if someone comes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge Be realistic said Jeod None of the guards has a flamberge Besides thistoad sticker is faster than a broadsword Brom shrugged Its your neck They walked casually along the street avoiding watchmen and soldiers Eragon was tense and his heart pounded As they passed Angelas shop a flash of movement on the roof caught his attention but he saw no one His palm tingled He looked at the roof again but it was still empty Brom led them along Teirms outer wall By the time they reached the castle the sky was black The sealed walls of the fortress made Eragon shiver He would hate to be imprisoned there Jeod silently took the lead and strode up to the gates trying to look at ease He pounded on the gate and waited A small grille slid open and a surly guard peered out Ya he grunted shortly Eragon could smell rum on his breath We need to get in said Jeod The guard peered at Jeod closer Wha for The boy here left something very valuable in my office We have to retrieve it immediately Eragon hung his head shamefaced The guard frowned clearly impatient to get back to his bottle Ah whaever he said swinging his arm Jus make sure n give im a good beating fr me Ill do that assured Jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate They entered the keep then Brom handed the guard a few coins Thankee mumbled the man tottering away As soon as he was gone Eragon pulled his bow from its tube and strung it Jeod quickly let them into the main part of the castle They hurried toward their destination listening carefully for any soldiers on patrol At the records room Brom tried the door It was locked He put his hand against the door and muttered a word that Eragon did not recognize It swung open with a faint click Brom grabbed a torch from the wall and they darted inside closing the door quietly The squat room was filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls A barred window was set in the far wall Jeod threaded his way between the racks running his eyes over the scrolls He halted at the back of the room Over here he said These are the shipping records for the past five years You can tell the date by the wax seals on the corner So what do we do now asked Eragon pleased that they had made it so far without being discovered Start at the top and work down said Jeod Some scrolls only deal with taxes You can ignore those Look for anything that mentions Seithr oil He took a length of parchment from his pouch and stretched it out on the floor then set a bottle of ink and a quill pen next to it So we can keep track of whatever we find he explained Brom scooped an armful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor He sat and unrolled the first one Eragon joined him positioning himself so he could see the door The tedious work was especially difficult for him as the cramped script on the scrolls was different from the printing Brom had taught him By looking only for the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas they winnowed out many of the scrolls Even so they moved down the rack slowly recording each shipment of Seithr oil as they located it It was quiet outside the room except for the occasional watchman Suddenly Eragons neck prickled He tried to keep working but the uneasy feeling remained Irritated he looked up and jerked with surprisea small boy crouched on the windowsill His eyes were slanted and a sprig of holly was woven into his shaggy black hair Do you need helpasked a voice in Eragons head His eyes widened with shock It sounded like Solembum Is that youhe asked incredulously Am I someone else Eragon gulped and concentrated on his scroll If my eyes dont deceive me you are The boy smiled slightly revealing pointed teethWhat I look like doesnt change who I am You dont think Im called a werecat for nothing do you What are you doing hereEragon asked The werecat tilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an answerThat depends on what you are doing here If you are reading those scrolls for entertainment then I suppose there isnt any reason for my visit But if what you are doing is unlawful and you dont want to be discovered I might be here to warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you and that this second official of the Empire has sent soldiers to search for you Thank you for telling mesaid Eragon Told you something did I I suppose I did And I suggest you make use of it The boy stood and tossed back his wild hair Eragon asked quicklyWhat did you mean last time about the tree and the vault Exactly what I said Eragon tried to ask more but the werecat vanished through the window He announced abruptly There are soldiers looking for us How do you know asked Brom sharply I listened in on the guard His replacement just sent men to search for us We have to get out of here Theyve probably already discovered that Jeods office is empty Are you sure asked Jeod Yes said Eragon impatiently Theyre on their way Brom snatched another scroll from the rack No matter We have to finish this now They worked furiously for the next minute scanning the records as fast as they could As the last scroll was finished Brom threw it back onto the rack and Jeod jammed his parchment ink and pen into his pouch Eragon grabbed the torch They raced from the room and shut the door but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of soldiers boots at the end of the hall They turned to leave but Brom hissed furiously Damnation Its not locked He put his hand against the door The lock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers came into view Hey Get away from that door shouted one of them Brom stepped back assuming a surprised expression The three men marched up to them The tallest one demanded Why are you trying to get into the records Eragon gripped his bow tighter and prepared to run Im afraid we lost our way The strain was evident in Jeods voice A drop of sweat rolled down his neck The soldier glared at them suspiciously Check inside the room he ordered one of his men Eragon held his breath as the soldier stepped up to the door tried to open it then pounded on it with his mailed fist Its locked sir The leader scratched his chin Arright then I dont know what you were up to but as long as the doors locked I guess youre free to go Come on The soldiers surrounded them and marched them back to the keep I cant believe itthought EragonTheyre helping us get away At the main gates the soldier pointed and said Now you walk through those and dont try anything Well be watching If you have to come back wait until morning Of course promised Jeod Eragon could feel the guards eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the castle The moment that the gates closed behind them a triumphant grin stretched across his face and he jumped into the air Brom shot him a cautioning look and growled Walk back to the house normally You can celebrate there Chastised Eragon adopted a staid demeanor but inside he still bubbled with energy Once they had hurried back to the house and into the study Eragon exclaimed We did it Yes but now we have to figure out if it was worth the trouble said Brom Jeod took a map of Alagaësia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk On the left side of the map the ocean extended to the unknown west Along the coast stretched the Spine an immense length of mountains The Hadarac Desert filled the center of the mapthe east end was blank Somewhere in that void hid the Varden To the south was Surda a small country that had seceded from the Empire after the Riders fall Eragon had been told that Surda secretly supported the Varden Near Surdas eastern border was a mountain range labeled Beor Mountains Eragon had heard of them in many storiesthey were supposed to be ten times the height of the Spine though he privately believed that was exaggeration The map was empty to the east of the Beors Five islands rested off the coast of Surda Nía Parlim Uden Illium and Beirland Nía was no more than an outcropping of rock but Beirland the largest had a small town Farther up near Teirm was a jagged island called Sharktooth And high to the north was one more island immense and shaped like a knobby hand Eragon knew its name without even looking Vroengard the ancestral home of the Ridersonce a place of glory but now a looted empty shell haunted by strange beasts In the center of Vroengard was the abandoned city of Dorú Areaba Carvahall was a small dot at the top of Palancar Valley Level with it but across the plains sprawled the forest Du Weldenvarden Like the Beor Mountains its eastern end was unmapped Parts of Du Weldenvardens western edge had been settled but its heart lay mysterious and unexplored The forest was wilder than the Spine the few who braved its depths often came back raving mad or not at all Eragon shivered as he saw Urûbaen in the center of the Empire King Galbatorix ruled from there with his black dragon Shruikan by his side Eragon put his finger on Urûbaen The Razac are sure to have a hiding place here You had better hope that that isnt their only sanctuary said Brom flatly Otherwise youll never get near them He pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands Jeod took the parchment out of his pouch and said From what I saw in the records there have been shipments of Seithr oil to every major city in the Empire over the past five years As far as I can tell all of them might have been ordered by wealthy jewelers Im not sure how we can narrow down the list without more information Brom swept a hand over the map I think we can eliminate some cities The Razac have to travel wherever the king wants and Im sure he keeps them busy If theyre expected to go anywhere at anytime the only reasonable place for them to stay is at a crossroads where they can reach every part of the country fairly easily He was excited now and paced the room This crossroads has to be large enough so the Razac will be inconspicuous It also has to have enough trade so any unusual requestsspecial food for their mounts for examplewill go unnoticed That makes sense said Jeod nodding Under those conditions we can ignore most of the cities in the north The only big ones are Teirm Gilead and Ceunon I know theyre not in Teirm and I doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the coast to Nardaits too small Ceunon is too isolated only Gilead remains The Razac might be there conceded Brom It would have a certain irony It would at that Jeod acknowledged softly What about southern cities asked Eragon Well said Jeod Theres obviously Urûbaen but thats an unlikely destination If someone were to die from Seithr oil in Galbatorixs court it would be all too easy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the Empire had been buying large amounts of it That still leaves many others any one of which could be the one we want Yes said Eragon but the oil wasnt sent to all of them The parchment only lists Kuasta DrasLeona Aroughs and Belatona Kuasta wouldnt work for the Razac its on the coast and surrounded by mountains Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon though it is a center of trade That leaves Belatona and DrasLeona which are rather close together Of the two I think DrasLeona is the likelier Its larger and better situated And thats where nearly all the goods of the Empire pass through at one time or another including Teirms said Jeod It would be a good place for the Razac to hide So DrasLeona said Brom as he sat down and lit his pipe What do the records show Jeod looked at the parchment Here it is At the beginning of the year three shipments of Seithr oil were sent to DrasLeona Each shipment was only two weeks apart and the records say they were all transported by the same merchant The same thing happened last year and the year before that I doubt any one jeweler or even a group of them has the money for so much oil What about Gilead asked Brom raising an eyebrow It doesnt have the same access to the rest of the Empire And Jeod tapped the parchment theyve only received the oil twice in recent years He thought for a moment then said Besides I think we forgot somethingHelgrind Brom nodded Ah yes the Dark Gates Its been many years since Ive thought of it Youre right that would make DrasLeona perfect for the Razac I guess its decided then thats where well go Eragon sat abruptly too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind wasI thought I would be happy to resume the hunt Instead I feel like an abyss has opened up before me DrasLeona Its so far away The parchment crackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map He handed it to Brom and said Youll need this Im afraid Your expeditions often take you into obscure regions Nodding Brom accepted the map Jeod clapped him on the shoulder It doesnt feel right that you will leave without me My heart expects to go along but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities I know said Brom But you have a life in Teirm It is time for the next generation to take up the standard Youve done your part be happy What of you asked Jeod Does the road ever end for you A hollow laugh escaped Broms lips I see it coming but not for a while He extinguished his pipe and they left for their rooms exhausted Before he fell asleep Eragon contacted Saphira to relate the nights adventures AC OSTLYMISTAKE In the morning Eragon and Brom retrieved their saddlebags from the stable and prepared to depart Jeod greeted Brom while Helen watched from the doorway With grave looks the two men clasped hands Ill miss you old man said Jeod And you I said Brom thickly He bowed his white head and then turned to Helen Thank you for your hospitality it was most gracious Her face reddened Eragon thought she was going to slap him Brom continued unperturbed You have a good husband take care of him There are few men as brave and as determined as he is But even he can not weather difficult times without support from those he loves He bowed again and said gently Only a suggestion dear lady Eragon watched as indignation and hurt crossed Helens face Her eyes flashed as she shut the door brusquely Sighing Jeod ran his fingers through his hair Eragon thanked him for all his help then mounted Cadoc With the last farewells said he and Brom departed At Teirms south gate the guards let them through without a second glance As they rode under the giant outer wall Eragon saw movement in a shadow Solembum was crouched on the ground tail twitching The werecat followed them with inscrutable eyes As the city receded into the distance Eragon asked What are werecats Brom looked surprised at the question Why the sudden curiosity I heard someone mention them in Teirm Theyre not real are they said Eragon pretending ignorance They are quite real During the Riders years of glory they were as renowned as the dragons Kings and elves kept them as companionsyet the werecats were free to do what they chose Very little has ever been known about them Im afraid that their race has become rather scarce recently Could they use magic asked Eragon No ones sure but they could certainly do unusual things They always seemed to know what was going on and somehow or another manage to get themselves involved Brom pulled his hood up to block a chill wind Whats Helgrind asked Eragon after a moments thought Youll see when we get to DrasLeona When Teirm was out of sight Eragon reached out with his mind and calledSaphira The force of his mental shout was so strong that Cadoc flicked his ears in annoyance Saphira answered and sped toward them with all of her strength Eragon and Brom watched as a dark blur rushed from a cloud then heard a dull roar as Saphiras wings flared open The sun shone behind the thin membranes turning them translucent and silhouetting the dark veins She landed with a blast of air Eragon tossed Cadocs reins to Brom Ill join you for lunch Brom nodded but seemed preoccupied Have a good time he said then looked at Saphira and smiled Its good to see you again And you too Eragon hopped onto Saphiras shoulders and held on tightly as she bounded upward With the wind at her tail Saphira sliced through the airHold on she warned Eragon and letting out a wild bugle she soared in a great loop Eragon yelled with excitement as he flung his arms in the air holding on only with his legs I didnt know I could stay on while you did that without being strapped into the saddlehe said grinning fiercely Neither did Iadmitted Saphira laughing in her peculiar way Eragon hugged her tightly and they flew a level path masters of the sky By noon his legs were sore from riding bareback and his hands and face were numb from the cold air Saphiras scales were always warm to the touch but she could not keep him from getting chilled When they landed for lunch he buried his hands in his clothes and found a warm sunny place to sit As he and Brom ate Eragon asked SaphiraDo you mind if I ride Cadoc He had decided to question Brom further about his past No but tell me what he saysEragon was not surprised that Saphira knew his plans It was nearly impossible to hide anything from her when they were mentally linked When they finished eating she flew away as he joined Brom on the trail After a time Eragon slowed Cadoc and said I need to talk to you I wanted to do it when we first arrived in Teirm but I decided to wait until now About what asked Brom Eragon paused Theres a lot going on that I dont understand For instance who are your friends and why were you hiding in Carvahall I trust you with my lifewhich is why Im still traveling with youbut I need to know more about who you are and what you are doing What did you steal in Gilead and what is the tuatha du orothrim that youre taking me through I think that after all thats happened I deserve an explanation You eavesdropped on us Only once said Eragon I see that you have yet to learn proper manners said Brom grimly tugging on his beard What makes you think that this concerns you Nothing really said Eragon shrugging Just its an odd coincidence that you happened to be hiding in Carvahall when I found Saphiras eggand that you also know so much dragonlore The more I think about it the less likely it seems There were other clues that I mostly ignored but theyre obvious now that I look back Like how you knew of the Razac in the first place and why they ran away when you approached And I cant help but wonder if you had something to do with the appearance of Saphiras egg Theres a lot you havent told us and Saphira and I cant afford to ignore anything that might be dangerous Dark lines appeared on Broms forehead as he reined Snowfire to a halt You wont wait he asked Eragon shook his head mulishly Brom sighed This wouldnt be a problem if you werent so suspicious but I suppose that you wouldnt be worth my time if you were otherwise Eragon was unsure if he should take that as a compliment Brom lit his pipe and slowly blew a plume of smoke into the air Ill tell you he said but you have to understand that I can not reveal everything Eragon started to protest but Brom cut him off Its not out of a desire to withhold information but because I wont give away secrets that arent mine There are other stories woven in with this narrative Youll have to talk with the others involved to find out the rest Very well Explain what you can said Eragon Are you sure asked Brom There are reasons for my secretiveness Ive tried to protect you by shielding you from forces that would tear you apart Once you know of them and their purposes youll never have the chance to live quietly You will have to choose sides and make a stand Do you really want to know I can not live my life in ignorance said Eragon quietly A worthy goal Very well there is a war raging in Alagaësia between the Varden and the Empire Their conflict however reaches far beyond any incidental armed clashes They are locked in a titanic power struggle centered around you Me said Eragon disbelieving Thats impossible I dont have anything to do with either of them Not yet said Brom but your very existence is the focus of their battles The Varden and the Empire arent fighting to control this land or its people Their goal is to control the next generation of Riders of whom you are the first Whoever controls these Riders will become the undisputed master of Alagaësia Eragon tried to absorb Broms statements It seemed incomprehensible that so many people would be interested in him and Saphira No one besides Brom had thought he was that important The whole concept of the Empire and Varden fighting over him was too abstract for him to grasp fully Objections quickly formed in his mind But all the Riders were killed except for the Forsworn who joined Galbatorix As far as I know even those are now dead And you told me in Carvahall that no one knows if there are still dragons in Alagaësia I lied about the dragons said Brom flatly Even though the Riders are gone there are still three dragon eggs leftall of them in Galbatorixs possession Actually there are only two now since Saphira hatched The king salvaged the three during his last great battle with the Riders So there may soon be two new Riders both of them loyal to the king asked Eragon with a sinking feeling Exactly said Brom There is a deadly race in progress Galbatorix is desperately trying to find the people for whom his eggs will hatch while the Varden are employing every means to kill his candidates or steal the eggs But where did Saphiras egg come from How could anyone have gotten it away from the king And why do you know all of this asked Eragon bewildered So many questions laughed Brom bitterly There is another chapter to all this one that took place long before you were born Back then I was a bit younger though perhaps not as wise I hated the Empirefor reasons Ill keep to myselfand wanted to damage it in any way I could My fervor led me to a scholar Jeod who claimed to have discovered a book that showed a secret passageway into Galbatorixs castle I eagerly brought Jeod to the Vardenwho are my friendsand they arranged to have the eggs stolen The Varden However something went amiss and our thief got only one egg For some reason he fled with it and didnt return to the Varden When he wasnt found Jeod and I were sent to bring him and the egg back Broms eyes grew distant and he spoke in a curious voice That was the start of one of the greatest searches in history We raced against the Razac and Morzan last of the Forsworn and the kings finest servant Morzan interrupted Eragon But he was the one who betrayed the Riders to GalbatorixAnd that happened so long ago Morzan must have been ancient It disturbed him to be reminded of how long Riders lived So asked Brom raising an eyebrow Yes he was old but strong and cruel He was one of the kings first followers and by far his most loyal As there had been blood between us before the hunt for the egg turned into a personal battle When it was located in Gilead I rushed there and fought Morzan for possession It was a terrible contest but in the end I slew him During the conflict I was separated from Jeod There was no time to search for him so I took the egg and bore it to the Varden who asked me to train whomever became the new Rider I agreed and decided to hide in Carvahallwhich I had been to several times beforeuntil the Varden contacted me I was never summoned Then how did Saphiras egg appear in the Spine Was another one stolen from the king asked Eragon Brom grunted Small chance of that He has the remaining two guarded so thoroughly that it would be suicide to try and steal them No Saphira was taken from the Varden and I think I know how To protect the egg its guardian must have tried to send it to me with magic The Varden havent contacted me to explain how they lost the egg so I suspect that their runners were intercepted by the Empire and the Razac were sent in their place Im sure they were quite eager to find me as Ive managed to foil many of their plans Then the Razac didnt know about me when they arrived in Carvahall said Eragon with wonder Thats right replied Brom If that ass Sloan had kept his mouth shut they might not have found out about you Events could have turned out quite differently In a way I have you to thank for my life If the Razac hadnt become so preoccupied with you they might have caught me unawares and that would have been the end of Brom the storyteller The only reason they ran was because Im stronger than the two of them especially during the day They must have planned to drug me during the night then question me about the egg You sent a message to the Varden telling them about me Yes Im sure theyll want me to bring you to them as soon as possible But youre not going to are you Brom shook his head No Im not Why not Being with the Varden must be safer than chasing after the Razac especially for a new Rider Brom snorted and looked at Eragon with fondness The Varden are dangerous people If we go to them you will be entangled in their politics and machinations Their leaders may send you on missions just to make a point even though you might not be strong enough for them I want you to be well prepared before you go anywhere near the Varden At least while we pursue the Razac I dont have to worry about someone poisoning your water This is the lesser of two evils And he said with a smile it keeps you happy while I train you Tuatha du orothrim is just a stage in your instruction Iwill help you findand perhaps even killthe Razac for they are as much my enemies as yours But then you will have to make a choice And that would be asked Eragon warily Whether to join the Varden said Brom If you kill the Razac the only ways for you to escape Galbatorixs wrath will be to seek the Vardens protection flee to Surda or plead for the kings mercy and join his forces Even if you dont kill the Razac you will still face this choice eventually Eragon knew the best way to gain sanctuary might be to join the Varden but he did not want to spend his entire life fighting the Empire like they did He mulled over Broms comments trying to consider them from every angle You still didnt explain how you know so much about dragons No I didnt did I said Brom with a crooked smile That will have to wait for another time Why meEragon asked himself What made him so special that he should become a Rider Did you ever meet my mother he blurted Brom looked grave Yes I did What was she like The old man sighed She was full of dignity and pride like Garrow Ultimately it was her downfall but it was one of her greatest gifts nevertheless She always helped the poor and the less fortunate no matter what her situation You knew her well asked Eragon startled Well enough to miss her when she was gone As Cadoc plodded along Eragon tried to recall when he had thought that Brom was just a scruffy old man who told stories For the first time Eragon understood how ignorant he had been He told Saphira what he had learned She was intrigued by Broms revelations but recoiled from the thought of being one of Galbatorixs possessions At last she saidArent you glad that you didnt stay in Carvahall Think of all the interesting experiences you would have missed Eragon groaned in mock distress When they stopped for the day Eragon searched for water while Brom made dinner He rubbed his hands together for warmth as he walked in a large circle listening for a creek or spring It was gloomy and damp between the trees He found a stream a ways from the camp then crouched on the bank and watched the water splash over the rocks dipping in his fingertips The icy mountain water swirled around his skin numbing itIt doesnt care what happens to us or anyone else thought Eragon He shivered and stood An unusual print on the opposing stream bank caught his attention It was oddly shaped and very large Curious he jumped across the stream and onto a rock shelf As he landed his foot hit a patch of damp moss He grabbed a branch for support but it broke and he thrust out his hand to break his fall He felt his right wrist crack as he hit the ground Pain lanced up his arm A steady stream of curses came out from behind his clenched teeth as he tried not to howl Half blind with pain he curled on the ground cradling his armEragon came Saphiras alarmed cryWhat happened Broke my wrist did something stupid fell Im comingsaid Saphira NoI can make it back Dont come Trees too close for wings She sent him a brief image of her tearing the forest apart to get at him then saidHurry Groaning he staggered upright The print was pressed deeply into the ground a few feet away It was the mark of a heavy nailstudded boot Eragon instantly remembered the tracks that had surrounded the pile of bodies in Yazuac Urgal he spat wishing that Zarroc was with him he could not use his bow with only one hand His head snapped up and he shouted with his mindSaphira Urgals Keep Brom safe Eragon leapt back over the stream and raced toward their camp yanking out his hunting knife He saw potential enemies behind every tree and bushI hope theres only one Urgal He burst into the camp ducking as Saphiras tail swung overhead Stop Its me he yelled Oopssaid Saphira Her wings were folded in front of her chest like a wall Oops growled Eragon running to her You couldve killed me Wheres Brom Im right here snapped Broms voice from behind Saphiras wings Tell your crazy dragon to release me she wont listen to me Let him go said Eragon exasperated Didnt you tell him Noshe said sheepishlyYou just said to keep him safe She lifted her wings and Brom stepped forward angrily I found an Urgal footprint And its fresh Brom immediately turned serious Saddle the horses Were leaving He put out the fire but Eragon did not move Whats wrong with your arm My wrist is broken he said swaying Brom cursed and saddled Cadoc for him He helped Eragon onto the horse and said We have to put a splint on your arm as soon as possible Try not to move your wrist until then Eragon gripped the reins tightly with his left hand Brom said to Saphira Its almost dark you might as well fly right overhead If Urgals show up theyll think twice about attacking with you nearby Theyd better or else they wont think againremarked Saphira as she took off The light was disappearing quickly and the horses were tired but they spurred them on without respite Eragons wrist swollen and red continued to throb A mile from the camp Brom halted Listen he said Eragon heard the faint call of a hunting horn behind them As it fell silent panic gripped him They must have found where we were said Brom and probably Saphiras tracks They will chase us now Its not in their nature to let prey escape Then two horns winded They were closer A chill ran through Eragon Our only chance is to run said Brom He raised his head to the sky and his face blanked as he called Saphira She rushed out of the night sky and landed Leave Cadoc Go with her Youll be safer commanded Brom What about you Eragon protested Ill be fine Now go Unable to muster the energy to argue Eragon climbed onto Saphira while Brom lashed Snowfire and rode away with Cadoc Saphira flew after him flapping above the galloping horses Eragon clung to Saphira as best he could he winced whenever her movements jostled his wrist The horns blared nearby bringing a fresh wave of terror Brom crashed through the underbrush forcing the horses to their limits The horns trumpeted in unison close behind him then were quiet Minutes passedWhere are the Urgals wondered Eragon A horn sounded this time in the distance He sighed in relief resting against Saphiras neck while on the ground Brom slowed his headlong rushThat was close said Eragon Yes but we can not stop untilSaphira was interrupted as a horn blasted directly underneath them Eragon jerked in surprise and Brom resumed his frenzied retreat Horned Urgals shouting with coarse voices barreled along the trail on horses swiftly gaining ground They were almost in sight of Brom the old man could not outrun themWe have to do something exclaimed Eragon What Land in front of the Urgals Are you crazydemanded Saphira Land I know what Im doingsaid EragonThere isnt time for anything else Theyre going to overtake Brom Very wellSaphira pulled ahead of the Urgals then turned preparing to drop onto the trail Eragon reached for his power and felt the familiar resistance in his mind that separated him from the magic He did not try to breach it yet A muscle twitched in his neck As the Urgals pounded up the trail he shouted Now Saphira abruptly folded her wings and dropped straight down from above the trees landing on the trail in a spray of dirt and rocks The Urgals shouted with alarm and yanked on their horses reins The animals went stifflegged and collided into each other but the Urgals quickly untangled themselves to face Saphira with bared weapons Hate crossed their faces as they glared at her There were twelve of them all ugly jeering brutes Eragon wondered why they did not flee He had thought that the sight of Saphira would frighten them awayWhy are they waiting Are they going to attack us or not He was shocked when the largest Urgal advanced and spat Our master wishes to speak with you human The monster spoke in deep rolling gutturals Its a trapwarned Saphira before Eragon could say anythingDont listen to him At least lets find out what he has to sayhe reasoned curious but extremely wary Who is your master he asked The Urgal sneered His name does not deserve to be given to one as low as yourself He rules the sky and holds dominance over the earth You are no more than a stray ant to him Yet he has decreed that you shall be brought before himalive Take heart that you have become worthy of such notice Ill never go with you nor any of my enemies declared Eragon thinking of Yazuac Whether you serve Shade Urgal or some twisted fiend Ive not heard of I have no wish to parley with him That is a grave mistake growled the Urgal showing his fangs There is no way to escape him Eventually you will stand before our master If you resist he will fill your days with agony Eragon wondered who had the power to bring the Urgals under one banner Was there a third great force loose in the landalong with the Empire and the Varden Keep your offer and tell your master that the crows can eat his entrails for all I care Rage swept through the Urgals their leader howled gnashing his teeth Well drag you to him then He waved his arm and the Urgals rushed at Saphira Raising his right hand Eragon barked Jierda Nocried Saphira but it was too late The monsters faltered as Eragons palm glowed Beams of light lanced from his hand striking each of them in the gut The Urgals were thrown through the air and smashed into trees falling senseless to the ground Fatigue suddenly drained Eragon of strength and he tumbled off Saphira His mind felt hazy and dull As Saphira bent over him he realized that he might have gone too far The energy needed to lift and throw twelve Urgals was enormous Fear engulfed him as he struggled to stay conscious At the edge of his vision he saw one of the Urgals stagger to his feet sword in hand Eragon tried to warn Saphira but he was too weakNo he thought feebly The Urgal crept toward Saphira until he was well past her tail then raised his sword to strike her neckNo Saphira whirled on the monster roaring savagely Her talons slashed with blinding speed Blood spurted everywhere as the Urgal was rent in two Saphira snapped her jaws together with finality and returned to Eragon She gently wrapped her bloody claws around his torso then growled and jumped into the air The night blurred into a painfilled streak The hypnotic sound of Saphiras wings put him in a bleary trance up down up down up down When Saphira eventually landed Eragon was dimly aware of Brom talking with her Eragon could not understand what they said but a decision must have been reached because Saphira took off again His stupor yielded to sleep that covered him like a soft blanket V ISION OFPERFECTION Eragon twisted under the blankets reluctant to open his eyes He dozed then a fuzzy thought entered his mind How did I get here Confused he pulled the blankets tighter and felt something hard on his right arm He tried to move his wrist It zinged with painThe Urgals He bolted upright He lay in a small clearing that was empty save a small campfire heating a stewfilled pot A squirrel chattered on a branch His bow and quiver rested alongside the blankets Attempting to stand made him grimace as his muscles were feeble and sore There was a heavy splint on his bruised right arm Where is everyonehe wondered forlornly He tried to call Saphira but to his alarm could not feel her Ravenous hunger gripped him so he ate the stew Still hungry he looked for the saddlebags hoping to find a chunk of bread Neither the saddlebags nor the horses were in the clearingIm sure theres a good reason for this he thought suppressing a surge of uneasiness He wandered about the clearing then returned to his blankets and rolled them up Without anything better to do he sat against a tree and watched the clouds overhead Hours passed but Brom and Saphira did not show upI hope nothings wrong As the afternoon dragged on Eragon grew bored and started to explore the surrounding forest When he became tired he rested under a fir tree that leaned against a boulder with a bowlshaped depression filled with clear dew water Eragon stared at the water and thought about Broms instructions for scryingMaybe I can see where Saphira is Brom said that scrying takes a lot of energy but Im stronger than he is He breathed deeply and closed his eyes In his mind he formed a picture of Saphira making it as lifelike as possible It was more demanding than he expected Then he said Draumr kópaand gazed at the water Its surface became completely flat frozen by an invisible force The reflections disappeared and the water became clear On it shimmered an image of Saphira Her surroundings were pure white but Eragon could see that she was flying Brom sat on her back beard streaming sword on his knees Eragon tiredly let the image fadeAt least theyre safe He gave himself a few minutes to recuperate then leaned back over the waterRoran how are you In his mind he saw his cousin clearly Impulsively he drew upon the magic and uttered the words The water grew still then the image formed on its surface Roran appeared sitting on an invisible chair Like Saphira his surroundings were white There were new lines on Rorans facehe looked more like Garrow than ever before Eragon held the image in place as long as he couldIs Roran in Therinsford Hes certainly nowhere Ive been The strain of using magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead He sighed and for a long time was content just to sit Then an absurd notion struck himWhat if I tried to scry something I created with my imagination or saw in a dream He smiledPerhaps Id be shown what my own consciousness looks like It was too tempting an idea to pass by He knelt by the water once againWhat shall I look for He considered a few things but discarded them all when he remembered his dream about the woman in the cell After fixing the scene in his mind he spoke the words and watched the water intently He waited but nothing happened Disappointed he was about to release the magic when inky blackness swirled across the water covering the surface The image of a lone candle flickered in the darkness brightening to illuminate a stone cell The woman from his dream was curled up on a cot in one corner She lifted her head dark hair falling back and stared directly at Eragon He froze the force of her gaze keeping him in place Chills ran up his spine as their eyes locked Then the woman trembled and collapsed limply The water cleared Eragon rocked back on his heels gasping This cant beShe shouldnt be real I only dreamed about her How could she know I was looking at her And how could I have scryed into a dungeon that Ive never seen He shook his head wondering if any of his other dreams had been visions The rhythmic thump of Saphiras wings interrupted his thoughts He hurried back to the clearing arriving just as Saphira landed Brom was on her back as Eragon had seen but his sword was now bloody Broms face was contorted the edges of his beard were stained red What happened asked Eragon afraid that he had been wounded What happened roared the old man Ive been trying to clean up your mess He slashed the air with the sword flinging drops of blood along its arc Do you know what you did with that little trick of yours Do you I stopped the Urgals from catching you said Eragon a pit forming in his stomach Yes growled Brom but that piece of magic nearly killed you Youve been sleeping for two days There were twelve UrgalsTwelve But that didnt stop you from trying to throw them all the way to Teirm now did it What were you thinking Sending a rock through each of their heads would have been the smart thing to do But no you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later Ive spent the last two days trying to track them down Even with Saphira three escaped I didnt want to kill them said Eragon feeling very small It wasnt a problem in Yazuac There was no choice then and I couldnt control the magic This time it just seemed extreme Extreme cried Brom Its not extreme when they wouldnt show you the same mercy And why oh why did youshow yourself to them You said that they had found Saphiras footprints It didnt make any difference if they saw me said Eragon defensively Brom stabbed his sword into the dirt and snapped I said they hadprobably found her tracks We didnt know for certain They might have believed they were chasing some stray travelers But why would they think that now After allyou landed right in front of them And since you let them live theyre scrambling around the countryside with all sorts of fantastic tales This might even get back to the Empire He threw his hands up You dont even deserve to be called a Rider after thisboy Brom yanked his sword out of the ground and stomped to the fire He took a rag from inside his robe and angrily began to clean the blade Eragon was stunned He tried to ask Saphira for advice but all she would say wasSpeak with Brom Hesitantly Eragon made his way to the fire and asked Would it help if I said I was sorry Brom sighed and sheathed his sword No it wouldnt Your feelings cant change what happened He jabbed his finger at Eragons chest You made some very bad choices that could have dangerous repercussions Not the least of which is that you almost died Died Eragon From now on youre going to have to think Theres a reason why were born with brains in our heads not rocks Eragon nodded abashed Its not as bad as you think though the Urgals already knew about me They had orders to capture me Astonishment widened Broms eyes He stuck his unlit pipe in his mouth No its not as bad as I thought Its worse Saphira told me you had talked with the Urgals but she didnt mention this The words tumbled out of Eragons mouth as he quickly described the confrontation So they have some sort of leader now eh questioned Brom Eragon nodded And you just defied his wishes insulted him and attacked his men Brom shook his head I didnt think it could get any worse If the Urgals had been killed your rudeness would have gone unnoticed but now itll be impossible to ignore Congratulations you just made enemies with one of the most powerful beings in Alagaësia All right I made a mistake said Eragon sullenly Yes you did agreed Brom eyes flashing What has me worried though is who this Urgal leader is Shivering Eragon asked softly What happens now There was an uncomfortable pause Your arm is going to take at least a couple of weeks to heal That time would be well spent forging some sense into you I suppose this is partially my fault Ive been teaching youhow to do things but not whether youshould It takes discretion something you obviously lack All the magic in Alagaësia wont help you if you dont know when to use it But were still going to DrasLeona right asked Eragon Brom rolled his eyes Yes we can keep looking for the Razac but even if we find them it wont do any good until youve healed He began unsaddling Saphira Are you well enough to ride I think so Good then we can still cover a few miles today Where are Cadoc and Snowfire Brom pointed off to the side Over there a ways I picketed them where there was grass Eragon prepared to leave then followed Brom to the horses Saphira said pointedlyIf you had explained what you were planning to do none of this would have happened I would have told you it was a bad idea not to kill the Urgals I only agreed to do what you asked because I assumed it was halfway reasonable I dont want to talk about it As you wishshe sniffed As they rode every bump and dip in the trail made Eragon grit his teeth with discomfort If he had been alone he would have stopped With Brom there he dared not complain Also Brom started drilling him with difficult scenarios involving Urgals magic and Saphira The imagined fights were many and varied Sometimes a Shade or other dragons were included Eragon discovered that it was possible to torture his body and mind at the same time He got most of the questions wrong and became increasingly frustrated When they stopped for the night Brom grumbled shortly It was a start Eragon knew that he was disappointed M ASTER OF THEBLADE The next day was easier on both of them Eragon felt better and was able to answer more of Broms questions correctly After an especially difficult exercise Eragon mentioned his scrying of the woman Brom pulled on his beard You say she was imprisoned Yes Did you see her face asked Brom intently Not very clearly The lighting was bad yet I could tell that she was beautiful Its strange I didnt have any problem seeing her eyes And she did look at me Brom shook his head As far as I know its impossible for anyone to know if theyre being scryed upon Do you know who she might be asked Eragon surprised by the eagerness in his own voice Not really admitted Brom If pressed I suppose I could come up with a few guesses but none of them would be very likely This dream of yours is peculiar Somehow you managed to scry in your sleep something that youd never seen beforewithout saying the words of power Dreams do occasionally touch the spirit realm but this is different Perhaps to understand this we should search every prison and dungeon until we find the woman bantered Eragon He actually thought it would be a good idea Brom laughed and rode on Broms strict training filled nearly every hour as the days slowly blended into weeks Because of his splint Eragon was forced to use his left hand whenever they sparred Before long he could duel as well with his left hand as he had with his right By the time they crossed the Spine and came to the plains spring had crept over Alagaësia summoning a multitude of flowers The bare deciduous trees were russet with buds while new blades of grass began to push up between last years dead stalks Birds returned from their winter absence to mate and build nests The travelers followed the Toark River southeast along the edge of the Spine It grew steadily as tributaries flowed into it from every side feeding its bulging girth When the river was over a league wide Brom pointed at the silt islands that dotted the water Were close to Leona Lake now he said Its only about two leagues away Do you think we can get there before nightfall asked Eragon We can try Dusk soon made the trail hard to follow but the sound of the river at their side guided them When the moon rose the bright disk provided enough light to see what lay ahead Leona Lake looked like a thin sheet of silver beaten over the land The water was so calm and smooth it did not even seem to be liquid Aside from a bright strip of moonlight reflecting off the surface it was indistinguishable from the ground Saphira was on the rocky shore fanning her wings to dry them Eragon greeted her and she saidThe water is lovelydeep cool and clear Maybe Ill go swimming tomorrowhe responded They set up camp under a stand of trees and were soon asleep At dawn Eragon eagerly rushed out to see the lake in daylight A whitecapped expanse of water rippled with fanshaped patterns where wind brushed it The pure size of it delighted him He whooped and ran to the waterSaphira where are you Lets have some fun The moment Eragon climbed onto her she jumped out over the water They soared upward circling over the lake but even at that height the opposing shore was not visibleWould you like to take a bath Eragon casually asked Saphira She grinned wolfishlyHold on She locked her wings and sank to the waves clipping the crests with her claws The water sparkled in the sunlight as they sailed over it Eragon whooped again Then Saphira folded her wings and dived into the lake her head and neck entering it like a lance The water hit Eragon like an icy wall knocking out his breath and almost tearing him off Saphira He held on tightly as she swam to the surface With three strokes of her feet she breached it and sent a burst of shimmering water toward the sky Eragon gasped and shook his hair as Saphira slithered across the lake using her tail as a rudder Ready Eragon nodded and took a deep breath tightening his arms This time they slid gently under the water They could see for yards through the unclouded liquid Saphira twisted and turned in fantastic shapes slipping through the water like an eel Eragon felt as if he were riding a sea serpent of legend Just as his lungs started to cry for air Saphira arched her back and pointed her head upward An explosion of droplets haloed them as she leapt into the air wings snapping open With two powerful flaps she gained altitude Wow That was fantasticexclaimed Eragon Yessaid Saphira happilyThough its a pity you cant hold your breath longer Nothing I can do about thathe said pressing water out of his hair His clothes were drenched and the wind from Saphiras wings chilled him He pulled at his splinthis wrist itched Once Eragon was dry he and Brom saddled the horses and started around Leona Lake in high spirits while Saphira playfully dived in and out of the water Before dinner Eragon blocked Zarrocs edge in preparation for their usual sparring Neither he nor Brom moved as they waited for the other to strike first Eragon inspected their surroundings for anything that might give him an advantage A stick near the fire caught his attention Eragon swooped down grabbed the stick and hurled it at Brom The splint got in his way though and Brom easily sidestepped the piece of wood The old man rushed forward swinging his sword Eragon ducked just as the blade whistled over his head He growled and tackled Brom ferociously They pitched to the ground each struggling to stay on top Eragon rolled to the side and swept Zarroc over the ground at Broms shins Brom parried the blow with the hilt of his sword then jumped to his feet Twisting as he stood Eragon attacked again guiding Zarroc through a complex pattern Sparks danced from their blades as they struck again and again Brom blocked each blow his face tight with concentration But Eragon could tell that he was tiring The relentless hammering continued as each sought an opening in the others defenses Then Eragon felt the battle change Blow by blow he gained advantage Broms parries slowed and he lost ground Eragon easily blocked a stab from Brom Veins pulsed on the old mans forehead and cords bulged in his neck from the effort Suddenly confident Eragon swung Zarroc faster than ever weaving a web of steel around Broms sword With a burst of speed he smashed the flat of his blade against Broms guard and knocked the sword to the ground Before Brom could react Eragon flicked Zarroc up to his throat They stood panting the red sword tip resting on Broms collarbone Eragon slowly lowered his arm and backed away It was the first time he had bested Brom without resorting to trickery Brom picked up his sword and sheathed it Still breathing hard he said Were done for today But we just started said Eragon startled Brom shook his head I can teach you nothing more of the sword Of all the fighters Ive met only three of them could have defeated me like that and I doubt any of them could have done it with their left hand He smiled ruefully I may not be as young as I used to be but I can tell that youre a talented and rare swordsman Does this mean were not going to spar every night asked Eragon Oh youre not getting out of it laughed Brom But well go easier now Its not as important if we miss a night here or there He wiped his brow Just remember if you ever have the misfortune to fight an elftrained or not female or maleexpect to lose They along with dragons and other creatures of magic are many times stronger than nature intended Even the weakest elf could easily overpower you The same goes for the Razacthey are not human and tire much more slowly than we do Is there any way to become their equal asked Eragon He sat crosslegged by Saphira You fought wellshe said He smiled Brom seated himself with a shrug There are a few but none are available to you now Magic will let you defeat all but the strongest enemies For those youll need Saphiras help plus a great deal of luck Remember when creatures of magic actually use magic they can accomplish things that could kill a human because of their enhanced abilities How do you fight with magic asked Eragon What do you mean Well he said leaning on an elbow Suppose I was attacked by a Shade How could I block his magic Most spells take place instantaneously which makes it impossible to react in time And even if I could how would I nullify an enemys magic It seems I would have to know my opponents intentionbefore he acted He paused I just dont see how it can be done Whoever attacked first would win Brom sighed What you are talking abouta wizards duel if you willis extremely dangerous Havent you ever wondered how Galbatorix was able to defeat all of the Riders with the help of only a dozen or so traitors I never thought about it acknowledged Eragon There are several ways Some youll learn about later but the main one is that Galbatorix was and still is a master of breaking into peoples minds You see in a wizards duel there are strict rules that each side must observe or else both contestants will die To begin with no one uses magic until one of the participants gains access to the others mind Saphira curled her tail comfortably around Eragon and askedWhy wait By the time an enemy realizes that youve attacked it will be too late for him to act Eragon repeated the question out loud Brom shook his head No it wont If I were to suddenly use my power against you Eragon you would surely die but in the brief moment before you were destroyed there would be time for a counterattack Therefore unless one combatant has a death wish neither side attacks until one of them has breached the others defenses Then what happens Eragon inquired Brom shrugged and said Once youre inside your enemys mind its easy enough to anticipate what he will do and prevent it Even with that advantage its still possible to lose if you dont know how to counteract spells He filled and lit his pipe And that requires extraordinarily quick thinking Before you can defend yourself you have to understand the exact nature of the forces directed at you If youre being attacked with heat you have to know whether it is being conveyed to you through air fire light or some other medium Only once thats known can you combat the magic by for instance chilling the heated material It sounds difficult Extremely confirmed Brom A plume of smoke rose from his pipe Seldom can people survive such a duel for more than a few seconds The enormous amount of effort and skill required condemns anyone without the proper training to a quick death Once youve progressed Ill start teaching you the necessary methods In the meantime if you ever find yourself facing a wizards duel I suggest you run away as fast as you can T HEMIRE OF DRASLEONA They lunched at Fasaloft a bustling lakeside village It was a charming place set on a rise overlooking the lake As they ate in the hostels common room Eragon listened intently to the gossip and was relieved to hear no rumors of him and Saphira The trail now a road had grown steadily worse over the past two days Wagon wheels and ironshod hooves had conspired to tear up the ground making many sections impassable An increase in travelers forced Saphira to hide during the day and then catch up with Brom and Eragon at night For days they continued south along Leona Lakes vast shore Eragon began to wonder if they would ever get around it so he was heartened when they met men who said that DrasLeona was an easy days ride ahead of them Eragon rose early the following morning His fingers twitched with anticipation at the thought of finally finding the RazacThe two of you must be careful said SaphiraThe Razac could have spies watching for travelers that fit your description Well do our best to remain inconspicuoushe assured her She lowered her head until their eyes metPerhaps but realize that I wont be able to protect you as I did with the Urgals I will be too far away to come to your aid nor would I survive long in the narrow streets your kind favor Follow Broms lead in this hunt he is sensible I knowhe said somberly Will you go with Brom to the Varden Once the Razac are killed he will want to take you to them And since Galbatorix will be enraged by the Razacs death that may be the safest thing for us to do Eragon rubbed his armsI dont want to fight the Empire all the time like the Varden do Life is more than constant war Therell be time to consider it once the Razac are gone Dont be too sureshe warned then went to hide herself until night The road was clogged with farmers taking their goods to market in DrasLeona Brom and Eragon were forced to slow their horses and wait for wagons that blocked the way Although they saw smoke in the distance before noon it was another league before the city was clearly visible Unlike Teirm a planned city DrasLeona was a tangled mess that sprawled next to Leona Lake Ramshackle buildings sat on crooked streets and the heart of the city was surrounded by a dirty pale yellow wall of daubed mud Several miles east a mountain of bare rock speared the sky with spires and columns a tenebrous nightmare ship Nearvertical sides rose out of the ground like a jagged piece of the earths bone Brom pointed Thatis Helgrind Its the reason DrasLeona was originally built People are fascinated by it even though its an unhealthy and malevolent thing He gestured at the buildings inside the citys wall We should go to the center of the city first As they crept along the road to DrasLeona Eragon saw that the highest building within the city was a cathedral that loomed behind the walls It was strikingly similar to Helgrind especially when its arches and flanged spires caught the light Who do they worship he asked Brom grimaced in distaste Their prayers go to Helgrind Its a cruel religion they practice They drink human blood and make flesh offerings Their priests often lack body parts because they believe that the more bone and sinew you give up the less youre attached to the mortal world They spend much of their time arguing about which of Helgrinds three peaks is the highest and most important and whether the fourthand lowestshould be included in their worship Thats horrible said Eragon shuddering Yes said Brom grimly but dont say that to a believer Youll quickly lose a hand in penance At DrasLeonas enormous gates they led the horses through the crush of people Ten soldiers were stationed on either side of the gates casually scanning the crowd Eragon and Brom passed into the city without incident The houses inside the city wall were tall and thin to compensate for the lack of space Those next to the wall were braced against it Most of the houses hung over the narrow winding streets covering the sky so that it was hard to tell if it was night or day Nearly all the buildings were constructed of the same rough brown wood which darkened the city even more The air reeked like a sewer the streets were filthy A group of ragged children ran between the houses fighting over scraps of bread Deformed beggars crouched next to the entrance gates pleading for money Their cries for help were like a chorus of the damnedWe dont even treat animals like this thought Eragon eyes wide with anger I wont stay here he said rebelling against the sight It gets better farther in said Brom Right now we need to find an inn and form a strategy DrasLeona can be a dangerous place to even the most cautious I dont want to remain on the streets any longer than necessary They forged deeper into DrasLeona leaving the squalid entrance behind As they entered wealthier parts of the city Eragon wonderedHow can these people live in ease when the suffering around them is so obvious They found lodging at the Golden Globe which was cheap but not decrepit A narrow bed was crammed against one wall of the room with a rickety table and a basin alongside it Eragon took one look at the mattress and said Im sleeping on the floor There are probably enough bugs in that thing to eat me alive Well I wouldnt want to deprive them of a meal said Brom dropping his bags on the mattress Eragon set his own on the floor and pulled off his bow What now he asked We find food and beer After that sleep Tomorrow we can start looking for the Razac Before they left the room Brom warned No matter what happens make sure that your tongue doesnt loosen Well have to leave immediately if were given away The inns food was barely adequate but its beer was excellent By the time they stumbled back to the room Eragons head was buzzing pleasantly He unrolled his blankets on the floor and slid under them as Brom tumbled onto the bed Just before Eragon fell asleep he contacted SaphiraWere going to be here for a few days but this shouldnt take as long as it did at Teirm When we discover where the Razac are you might be able to help us get them Ill talk to you in the morning Right now Im not thinking too clearly Youve been drinkingcame the accusing thought Eragon considered it for a moment and had to agree that she was absolutely right Her disapproval was clear but all she said wasI wont envy you in the morning Nogroaned Eragonbut Brom will He drank twice as much as I did T RAIL OFOIL W hat was I thinkingwondered Eragon in the morning His head was pounding and his tongue felt thick and fuzzy As a rat skittered under the floor Eragon winced at the noise How are we feelingasked Saphira smugly Eragon ignored her A moment later Brom rolled out of bed with a grumble He doused his head in cold water from the basin then left the room Eragon followed him into the hallway Where are you going he asked To recover Ill come At the bar Eragon discovered that Broms method of recovery involved imbibing copious amounts of hot tea and ice water and washing it all down with brandy When they returned to the room Eragon was able to function somewhat better Brom belted on his sword and smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe The first thing we need to do is ask some discreet questions I want to find out where the Seithr oil was delivered in DrasLeona and where it was taken from there Most likely soldiers or workmen were involved in transporting it We have to find those men and get one to talk They left the Golden Globe and searched for warehouses where the Seithr oil might have been delivered Near the center of DrasLeona the streets began to slant upward toward a palace of polished granite It was built on a rise so that it towered above every building except the cathedral The courtyard was a mosaic of motherofpearl and parts of the walls were inlaid with gold Black statues stood in alcoves with sticks of incense smoking in their cold hands Soldiers stationed every four yards watched passersby keenly Who lives there asked Eragon in awe Marcus Tábor ruler of this city He answers only to the king and his own conscience which hasnt been very active recently said Brom They walked around the palace looking at the gated ornate houses that surrounded it By midday they had learned nothing useful so they stopped for lunch This city is too vast for us to comb it together said Brom Search on your own Meet me at the Golden Globe by dusk He glowered at Eragon from under his bushy eyebrows Im trusting you not to do anything stupid I wont promised Eragon Brom handed him some coins then strode away in the opposite direction Throughout the rest of the day Eragon talked with shopkeepers and workers trying to be as pleasant and charming as he could His questions led him from one end of the city to the other and back again No one seemed to know about the oil Wherever he went the cathedral stared down at him It was impossible to escape its tall spires At last he found a man who had helped ship the Seithr oil and remembered to which warehouse it had been taken Eragon excitedly went to look at the building then returned to the Golden Globe It was over an hour before Brom came back slumped with fatigue Did you find anything asked Eragon Brom brushed back his white hair I heard a great deal of interesting things today not the least of which is that Galbatorix will visit DrasLeona within the week What exclaimed Eragon Brom slouched against the wall the lines on his forehead deepening It seems that Tábor has taken a few too many liberties with his power so Galbatorix has decided to come teach him a lesson in humility Its the first time the king has left Urûbaen in over ten years Do you think he knows of us asked Eragon Of course heknows of us but Im sure he hasnt been told our location If he had we would already be in the Razacs grasp However this means that whatever were going to do about the Razac must be accomplished before Galbatorix arrives We dont want to be anywhere within twenty leagues of him The one thing in our favor is that the Razac are sure to be here preparing for his visit I want to get the Razac said Eragon his fists tightening but not if it means fighting the king He could probably tear me to pieces That seemed to amuse Brom Very good caution And youre right you wouldnt stand a chance against Galbatorix Now tell me what you learned today It might confirm what I heard Eragon shrugged It was mostly drivel but I did talk with a man who knew where the oil was taken Its just an old warehouse Other than that I didnt discover anything useful My day was a little more fruitful than yours I heard the same thing you did so I went to the warehouse and talked with the workers It didnt take much cajoling before they revealed that the cases of Seithr oil are always sent from the warehouse to the palace And thats when you came back here finished Eragon No its not Dont interrupt After that I went to the palace and got myself invited into the servants quarters as a bard For several hours I wandered about amusing the maids and others with songs and poemsand asking questions all the while Brom slowly filled his pipe with tobacco Its really amazing all the things servants find out Did you know that one of the earls hasthree mistresses and they all live in the same wing of the palace He shook his head and lit the pipe Aside from the fascinating tidbits I was told quite by accident where the oil is taken from the palace And that is asked Eragon impatiently Brom puffed on his pipe and blew a smoke ring Out of the city of course Every full moon two slaves are sent to the base of Helgrind with a months worth of provisions Whenever the Seithr oil arrives in DrasLeona they send it along with the provisions The slaves are never seen again And the one time someone followed them he disappeared too I thought the Riders demolished the slave trade said Eragon Unfortunately it has flourished under the kings reign So the Razac are in Helgrind said Eragon thinking of the rock mountain There or somewhere nearby If theyare in Helgrind theyll be either at the bottomand protected by a thick stone dooror higher up where only their flying mounts or Saphira can reach Top or bottom their shelter will no doubt be disguised He thought for a moment If Saphira and I go flying around Helgrind the Razac are sure to see usnot to mention all of DrasLeona It is a problem agreed Brom Eragon frowned What if we took the place of the two slaves The full moon isnt far off It would give us a perfect opportunity to get close to the Razac Brom tugged his beard thoughtfully Thats chancy at best If the slaves are killed from a distance well be in trouble We cant harm the Razac if they arent in sight We dont know if the slaves are killed at all Eragon pointed out Im sure they are said Brom his face grave Then his eyes sparkled and he blew another smoke ring Still its an intriguing idea If it were done with Saphira hidden nearby and a His voice trailed off It might work but well have to move quickly With the king coming there isnt much time Should we go to Helgrind and look around It would be good to see the land in daylight so we wont be surprised by any ambushes said Eragon Brom fingered his staff That can be done later Tomorrow Ill return to the palace and figure out how we can replace the slaves I have to be careful not to arouse suspicion thoughI could easily be revealed by spies and courtiers who know about the Razac I cant believe it we actually found them said Eragon quietly An image of his dead uncle and burned farm flashed through his mind His jaw tightened The toughest part is yet to come but yes weve done well said Brom If fortune smiles on us you may soon have your revenge and the Varden will be rid of a dangerous enemy What comes after that will be up to you Eragon opened his mind and jubilantly told SaphiraWe found the Razacs lair WhereHe quickly explained what they had discoveredHelgrind she musedA fitting place for them Eragon agreedWhen were done here maybe we could visit Carvahall What is it you wantshe asked suddenly sourTo go back to your previous life You know that wont happen so stop mooning after it At a certain point you have to decide what to commit to Will you hide for the rest of your life or will you help the Varden Those are the only options left to you unless you join forces with Galbatorix which I do not and never will accept Softly he said If I must choose I cast my fate with the Varden as you well know Yes but sometimes you have to hear yourself say itShe left him to ponder her words Wo RSHIPERS OFHELGRIND Eragon was alone in the room when he woke Scrawled onto the wall with a charcoal stick was a note that read Eragon I will be gone until late tonight Coins for food are under the mattress Explore the city enjoy yourself butstay unnoticed Brom PS Avoid the palace Dont go anywhere without your bow Keep it strung Eragon wiped the wall clean then retrieved the money from under the bed He slipped the bow across his back thinkingI wish I didnt have to go armed all the time He left the Golden Globe and ambled through the streets stopping to observe whatever interested him There were many intriguing stores but none quite as exciting as Angelas herb shop in Teirm At times he glared at the dark claustrophobic houses and wished that he were free of the city When he grew hungry he bought a wedge of cheese and a loaf of bread and ate them sitting on a curb Later in a far corner of DrasLeona he heard an auctioneer rattling off a list of prices Curious he headed toward the voice and arrived at a wide opening between two buildings Ten men stood on a waisthigh platform Arrayed before them was a richly dressed crowd that was both colorful and boisterousWhere are the goods for sale wondered Eragon The auctioneer finished his list and motioned for a young man behind the platform to join him The man awkwardly climbed up chains dragging at his hands and feet And here we have our first item proclaimed the auctioneer A healthy male from the Hadarac Desert captured just last month and in excellent condition Look at those arms and legs hes strong as a bull Hed be perfect as a shield bearer or if you dont trust him for that hard labor But let me tell you lords and ladies that would be a waste Hes bright as a nail if you can get him to talk a civilized tongue The crowd laughed and Eragon ground his teeth with fury His lips started to form a word that would free the slave and his arm newly liberated from the splint rose The mark on his palm shimmered He was about to release the magic when it struck himHed never get away The slave would be caught before he reached the city walls Eragon would only make the situation worse if he tried to help He lowered his arm and quietly cursedThink This is how you got into trouble with the Urgals He watched helplessly as the slave was sold to a tall hawknosed man The next slave was a tiny girl no more than six years old wrenched from the arms of her crying mother As the auctioneer started the bidding Eragon forced himself to walk away rigid with fury and outrage It was several blocks before the weeping was inaudibleId like to see a thief try to cut my purse right now he thought grimly almost wishing it would happen Frustrated he punched a nearby wall bruising his knuckles Thats the sort of thing I could stop by fighting the Empirehe realized With Saphira by my side I could free those slaves Ive been graced with special powers it would be selfish of me not to use them for the benefit of others If I dont I might as well not be a Rider at all It was a while before he took stock of his bearings and was surprised to find himself before the cathedral Its twisted spires were covered with statues and scrollwork Snarling gargoyles crouched along the eaves Fantastic beasts writhed on the walls and heroes and kings marched along their bottom edges frozen in cold marble Ribbed arches and tall stainedglass windows lined the cathedrals sides along with columns of differing sizes A lonely turret helmed the building like a mast Recessed in shadow at the cathedrals front was an ironbound door inlaid with a row of silver script that Eragon recognized as the ancient language As best he could tell it readMay thee who enter here understand thine impermanence and forget thine attachments to that which is beloved The entire building sent a shiver down Eragons spine There was something menacing about it as if it were a predator crouched in the city waiting for its next victim A broad row of steps led to the cathedrals entrance Eragon solemnly ascended them and stopped before the doorI wonder if I can go in Almost guiltily he pushed on the door It swung open smoothly gliding on oiled hinges He stepped inside The silence of a forgotten tomb filled the empty cathedral The air was chill and dry Bare walls extended to a vaulted ceiling that was so high Eragon felt no taller than an ant Stainedglass windows depicting scenes of anger hate and remorse pierced the walls while spectral beams of light washed sections of the granite pews with transparent hues leaving the rest in shadow His hands were shaded a deep blue Between the windows stood statues with rigid pale eyes He returned their stern gazes then slowly trod up the center row afraid to break the quiet His leather boots padded noiselessly on the polished stone floor The altar was a great slab of stone devoid of adornment A solitary finger of light fell upon it illuminating motes of golden dust floating in the air Behind the altar the pipes of a wind organ pierced the ceiling and opened themselves to the elements The instrument would play its music only when a gale rocked DrasLeona Out of respect Eragon knelt before the altar and bowed his head He did not pray but paid homage to the cathedral itself The sorrows of the lives it had witnessed as well as the unpleasantness of the elaborate pageantry that played out between its walls emanated from the stones It was a forbidding place bare and cold In that chilling touch though came a glimpse of eternity and perhaps the powers that lay there Finally Eragon inclined his head and rose Calm and grave he whispered words to himself in the ancient language then turned to leave He froze His heart jumped hammering like a drum The Razac stood at the cathedrals entrance watching him Their swords were drawn keen edges bloody in a crimson light A sibilant hiss came from the smaller Razac Neither of them moved Rage welled up in Eragon He had chased the Razac for so many weeks that the pain of their murderous deed had dulled within him But his vengeance was at hand His wrath exploded like a volcano fueled even more by his pentup fury at the slaves plight A roar broke from his lips echoing like a thunderstorm as he snatched his bow from his back Deftly he fit an arrow to the string and loosed it Two more followed an instant later The Razac leapt away from the arrows with inhuman swiftness They hissed as they ran up the aisle between the pews cloaks flapping like raven wings Eragon reached for another arrow but caution stayed his handIf they knew where to find me Brom is in danger as well I must warn him Then to Eragons horror a line of soldiers filed into the cathedral and he glimpsed a field of uniforms jostling outside the doorway Eragon gazed hungrily at the charging Razac then swept around searching for means of escape A vestibule to the left of the altar caught his attention He bounded through the archway and dashed down a corridor that led to a priory with a belfry The patter of the Razacs feet behind him made him quicken his pace until the hall abruptly ended with a closed door He pounded against it trying to break it open but the wood was too strong The Razac were nearly upon him Frantic he sucked in his breath and barked Jierda With a flash the door splintered into pieces and fell to the floor Eragon jumped into the small room and continued running He sped through several chambers startling a group of priests Shouts and curses followed him The priory bell tolled an alarm Eragon dodged through a kitchen passed a pair of monks then slipped through a side door He skidded to stop in a garden surrounded by a high brick wall devoid of handholds There were no other exits Eragon turned to leave but there was a low hiss as the Razac shouldered aside the door Desperate he rushed at the wall arms pumping Magic could not help him hereif he used it to break through the wall he would be too tired to run He jumped Even with his arms outstretched only his fingertips cleared the edge of the wall The rest of his body smashed against the bricks driving out his breath Eragon gasped and hung there struggling not to fall The Razac prowled into the garden swinging their heads from side to side like wolfhounds sniffing for prey Eragon sensed their approach and heaved with his arms His shoulders shrieked with pain as he scrambled onto the wall and dropped to the other side He stumbled then regained his balance and darted down an alley just as the Razac leapt over the wall Galvanized Eragon put on another burst of speed He ran for over a mile before he had to stop and catch his breath Unsure if he had lost the Razac he found a crowded marketplace and dived under a parked wagonHow did they find me he wondered pantingThey shouldnt have known where I was unless something happened to Brom He reached out with his mind to Saphira and saidThe Razac found me Were all in danger Check if Broms all right If he is warn him and have him meet me at the inn And be ready to fly here as fast as you can We may need your help to escape She was silent then said curtlyHell meet you at the inn Dont stop moving youre in great danger Dont I know it muttered Eragon as he rolled out from under the wagon He hurried back to the Golden Globe quickly packed their belongings saddled the horses then led them to the street Brom soon arrived staff in hand scowling dangerously He swung onto Snowfire and asked What happened I was in the cathedral when the Razac just appeared behind me said Eragon climbing onto Cadoc I ran back as fast as possible but they could be here at any second Saphira will join us once were out of DrasLeona We have to get outside the city walls before they close the gates if they havent already said Brom If theyre shut itll be nigh impossible for us to leave Whatever you do dont get separated from me Eragon stiffened as ranks of soldiers marched down one end of the street Brom cursed lashed Snowfire with his reins and galloped away Eragon bent low over Cadoc and followed They nearly crashed several times during the wild hazardous ride plunging through masses of people that clogged the streets as they neared the city wall When the gates finally came into view Eragon pulled on Cadocs reins with dismay The gates were already half closed and a double line of pikemen blocked their way Theyll cut us to pieces he exclaimed We have to try and make it said Brom his voice hard Ill deal with the men but you have to keep the gates open for us Eragon nodded gritted his teeth and dug his heels into Cadoc They plowed toward the line of unwavering soldiers who lowered their pikes toward the horses chests and braced the weapons against the ground Though the horses snorted with fear Eragon and Brom held them in place Eragon heard the soldiers shout but kept his attention on the gates inching shut As they neared the sharp pikes Brom raised his hand and spoke The words struck with precision the soldiers fell to each side as if their legs had been cut out from under them The gap between the gates shrank by the second Hoping that the effort would not prove too much for him Eragon drew on his power and shouted Du grind huildr A deep grating sound emanated from the gates as they trembled then ground to a stop The crowd and guards fell silent staring with amazement With a clatter of the horses hooves Brom and Eragon shot out from behind DrasLeonas wall The instant they were free Eragon released the gates They shuddered then boomed shut He swayed with the expected fatigue but managed to keep riding Brom watched him with concern Their flight continued through the outskirts of DrasLeona as alarm trumpets sounded on the city wall Saphira was waiting for them by the edge of the city hidden behind some trees Her eyes burned her tail whipped back and forth Go ride her said Brom And this time stay in the air no matter what happens to me Ill head south Fly nearby I dont care if Saphiras seen Eragon quickly mounted Saphira As the ground dwindled away beneath him he watched Brom gallop along the road Are you all rightasked Saphira Yessaid EragonBut only because we were very lucky A puff of smoke blew from her nostrilsAll the time weve spent searching for the Razac was useless I knowhe said letting his head sag against her scalesIf the Razac had been the only enemies back there I would have stayed and fought but with all the soldiers on their side it was hardly a fair match You understand that there will be talk of us now This was hardly an unobtrusive escape Evading the Empire will be harder than everThere was an edge to her voice that he was unaccustomed to I know They flew low and fast over the road Leona Lake receded behind them the land became dry and rocky and filled with tough sharp bushes and tall cactuses Clouds darkened the sky Lightning flashed in the distance As the wind began to howl Saphira glided steeply down to Brom He stopped the horses and asked Whats wrong The winds too strong Its not that bad objected Brom It is up there said Eragon pointing at the sky Brom swore and handed him Cadocs reins They trotted away with Saphira following on foot though on the ground she had difficulty keeping up with the horses The gale grew stronger flinging dirt through the air and twisting like a dervish They wrapped scarves around their heads to protect their eyes Broms robe flapped in the wind while his beard whipped about as if it had a life of its own Though it would make them miserable Eragon hoped it would rain so their tracks would be obliterated Soon darkness forced them to stop With only the stars to guide them they left the road and made camp behind two boulders It was too dangerous to light a fire so they ate cold food while Saphira sheltered them from the wind After the sparse dinner Eragon asked bluntly How did they find us Brom started to light his pipe but thought better of it and put it away One of the palace servants warned me there were spies among them Somehow word of me and my questions must have reached Tábor and through him the Razac We cant go back to DrasLeona can we asked Eragon Brom shook his head Not for a few years Eragon held his head between his hands Then should we draw the Razac out If we let Saphira be seen theyll come running to wherever she is And when they do there will be fifty soldiers with them said Brom At any rate this isnt the time to discuss it Right now we have to concentrate on staying alive Tonight will be the most dangerous because the Razac will be hunting us in the dark when they are strongest Well have to trade watches until morning Right said Eragon standing He hesitated and squinted His eyes had caught a flicker of movement a small patch of color that stood out from the surrounding nightscape He stepped toward the edge of their camp trying to see it better What is it asked Brom as he unrolled his blankets Eragon stared into the darkness then turned back I dont know I thought I saw something It must have been a bird Pain erupted in the back of his head and Saphira roared Then Eragon toppled to the ground unconscious T HERAZACSREVENGE Adull throbbing roused Eragon Every time blood pulsed through his head it brought a fresh wave of pain He cracked his eyes open and winced tears rushed to his eyes as he looked directly into a bright lantern He blinked and looked away When he tried to sit up he realized that his hands were tied behind his back He turned lethargically and saw Broms arms Eragon was relieved to see that they were bound together Why was that He struggled to figure it out until the thought suddenly came to himThey wouldnt tie up a dead man But then who were they He swiveled his head further then stopped as a pair of black boots entered his vision Eragon looked up right into the cowled face of a Razac Fear jolted through him He reached for the magic and started to voice a word that would kill the Razac but then halted puzzled He could not remember the word Frustrated he tried again only to feel it slip out of his grasp Above him the Razac laughed chillingly The drug is working yesss I think you will not be bothering us again There was a rattle off to the left and Eragon was appalled to see the second Razac fit a muzzle over Saphiras head Her wings were pinioned to her sides by black chains there were shackles on her legs Eragon tried to contact her but felt nothing She was most cooperative once we threatened to kill you hissed the Razac Squatting by the lantern he rummaged through Eragons bags examining and discarding various items until he removed Zarroc What a pretty thing for one so insignificant Maybe I will keep it He leaned closer and sneered Or maybe if you behave our master will let you polish it His moist breath smelled like raw meat Then he turned the sword over in his hands and screeched as he saw the symbol on the scabbard His companion rushed over They stood over the sword hissing and clicking At last they faced Eragon You will serve our master very well yesss Eragon forced his thick tongue to form words If I do I will kill you They chuckled coldly Oh no we are too valuable But you you aredisposable A deep snarl came from Saphira smoke roiled from her nostrils The Razac did not seem to care Their attention was diverted when Brom groaned and rolled onto his side One of the Razac grabbed his shirt and thrust him effortlessly into the air Itsss wearing off Give him more Letsss just kill him said the shorter Razac He has caused us much grief The taller one ran his finger down his sword A good plan But remember the kings instructions were to keep themalive We can sssay he was killed when we captured them And what of thisss one the Razac asked pointing his sword at Eragon If he talksss His companion laughed and drew a wicked dagger He would not dare There was a long silence then Agreed They dragged Brom to the center of the camp and shoved him to his knees Brom sagged to one side Eragon watched with growing fearI have to get free He wrenched at the ropes but they were too strong to break None of that now said the tall Razac poking him with a sword He nosed the air and sniffed something seemed to trouble him The other Razac growled yanked Broms head back and swept the dagger toward his exposed throat At that very moment a low buzz sounded followed by the Razacs howl An arrow protruded from his shoulder The Razac nearest Eragon dropped to the ground barely avoiding a second arrow He scuttled to his wounded companion and they glared into the darkness hissing angrily They made no move to stop Brom as he blearily staggered upright Get down cried Eragon Brom wavered then tottered toward Eragon As more arrows hissed into the camp from the unseen attackers the Razac rolled behind some boulders There was a lull then arrows came from the opposite direction Caught by surprise the Razac reacted slowly Their cloaks were pierced in several places and a shattered arrow buried itself in ones arm With a wild cry the smaller Razac fled toward the road kicking Eragon viciously in the side as he passed His companion hesitated then grabbed the dagger from the ground and raced after him As he left the camp he hurled the knife at Eragon A strange light suddenly burned in Broms eyes He threw himself in front of Eragon his mouth open in a soundless snarl The dagger struck him with a soft thump and he landed heavily on his shoulder His head lolled limply No screamed Eragon though he was doubled over in pain He heard footsteps then his eyes closed and he knew no more M URTAGH For a long while Eragon was aware only of the burning in his side Each breath was painful It felt as though he had been the one stabbed not Brom His sense of time was skewed it was hard to tell if weeks had gone by or only a few minutes When consciousness finally came to him he opened his eyes and peered curiously at a campfire several feet away His hands were still tied together but the drug must have worn off because he could think clearly againSaphira are you injured No but you and Brom areShe was crouched over Eragon wings spread protectively on either side Saphira you didnt make that fire did you And you couldnt have gotten out of those chains by yourself No I didnt think soEragon struggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire The stranger dressed in battered clothes exuded a calm assured air In his hands was a bow at his side a long handandahalf sword A white horn bound with silver fittings lay in his lap and the hilt of a dagger protruded from his boot His serious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair He appeared to be a few years older than Eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller Behind him a gray warhorse was picketed The stranger watched Saphira warily Who are you asked Eragon taking a shallow breath The mans hands tightened on his bow Murtagh His voice was low and controlled but curiously emotional Eragon pulled his hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him He clenched his teeth as his side flared with pain Why did you help us You arent the only enemies the Razac have I was tracking them You know who they are Yes Eragon concentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic He hesitated aware of Murtaghs eyes on him then decided it didnt matter Jierda he grunted The ropes snapped off his wrists He rubbed his hands to get the blood flowing Murtagh sucked in his breath Eragon braced himself and tried to stand but his ribs seared with agony He fell back gasping between clenched teeth Murtagh tried to come to his aid but Saphira stopped him with a growl I would have helped you earlier but your dragon wouldnt let me near you Her names Saphira said Eragon tightlyNow let him by I cant do this alone Besides he saved our lives Saphira growled again but folded her wings and backed away Murtagh eyed her flatly as he stepped forward He grasped Eragons arm gently pulling him to his feet Eragon yelped and would have fallen without support They went to the fire where Brom lay on his back How is he asked Eragon Bad said Murtagh lowering him to the ground The knife went right between his ribs You can look at him in a minute but first wed better see how much damage the Razac did to you He helped Eragon remove his shirt then whistled Ouch Ouch agreed Eragon weakly A blotchy bruise extended down his left side The red swollen skin was broken in several places Murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed lightly Eragon yelled and Saphira growled a warning Murtagh glanced at Saphira as he grabbed a blanket I think you have some broken ribs Its hard to tell but at least two maybe more Youre lucky youre not coughing up blood He tore the blanket into strips and bound Eragons chest Eragon slipped the shirt back on Yes Im lucky He took a shallow breath sidled over to Brom and saw that Murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound With trembling fingers he undid the bandage I wouldnt do that warned Murtagh Hell bleed to death without it Eragon ignored him and pulled the cloth away from Broms side The wound was short and thin belying its depth Blood streamed out of it As he had learned when Garrow was injured a wound inflicted by the Razac was slow to heal He peeled off his gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words Brom had taught himHelp me Saphira he imploredI am too weak to do this alone Saphira crouched next to him fixing her eyes on BromI am here Eragon As her mind joined his new strength infused his body Eragon drew upon their combined power and focused it on the words His hand trembled as he held it over the wound Waíse heill he said His palm glowed and Broms skin flowed together as if it had never been broken Murtagh watched the entire process It was over quickly As the light vanished Eragon sat feeling sickWeve never done that before he said Saphira noddedTogether we can cast spells that are beyond either of us Murtagh examined Broms side and asked Is he completely healed I can only mend what is on the surface I dont know enough to fix whatevers damaged inside Its up to him now Ive done all I can Eragon closed his eyes for a moment utterly weary My my head seems to be floating in clouds You probably need to eat said Murtagh Ill make soup While Murtagh fixed the meal Eragon wondered who this stranger was His sword and bow were of the finest make as was his horn Either he was a thief or accustomed to moneyand lots of itWhy was he hunting the Razac What have they done to make him an enemy I wonder if he works for the Varden Murtagh handed him a bowl of broth Eragon spooned it down and asked How long has it been since the Razac fled A few hours We have to go before they return with reinforcements You might be able to travel said Murtagh then gestured at Brom but he cant You dont get up and ride away after being stabbed between the ribs If we make a litter can you carry Brom with your claws like you did with GarrowEragon asked Saphira Yes but landing will be awkward As long as it can be doneEragon said to Murtagh Saphira can carry him but we need a litter Can you make one I dont have the strength Wait here Murtagh left the camp sword drawn Eragon hobbled to his bags and picked up his bow from where it had been thrown by the Razac He strung it found his quiver then retrieved Zarroc which lay hidden in shadow Last he got a blanket for the litter Murtagh returned with two saplings He laid them parallel on the ground then lashed the blanket between the poles After he carefully tied Brom to the makeshift litter Saphira grasped the saplings and laboriously took flight I never thought I would see a sight like that Murtagh said an odd note in his voice As Saphira disappeared into the dark sky Eragon limped to Cadoc and hoisted himself painfully into the saddle Thanks for helping us You should leave now Ride as far away from us as you can Youll be in danger if the Empire finds you with us We cant protect you and I wouldnt see harm come to you on our account A pretty speech said Murtagh grinding out the fire but where will you go Is there a place nearby that you can rest in safety No admitted Eragon Murtaghs eyes glinted as he fingered the hilt of his sword In that case I think Ill accompany you until youre out of danger Ive no better place to be Besides if I stay with you I might get another shot at the Razac sooner than if I were on my own Interesting things are bound to happen around a Rider Eragon wavered unsure if he should accept help from a complete stranger Yet he was unpleasantly aware that he was too weak to force the issue either wayIf Murtagh proves untrustworthy Saphira can always chase him away Join us if you wish He shrugged Murtagh nodded and mounted his gray warhorse Eragon grabbed Snowfires reins and rode away from the camp into the wilderness An oxbow moon provided wan light but he knew that it would only make it easier for the Razac to track them Though Eragon wanted to question Murtagh further he kept silent conserving his energy for riding Near dawn Saphira saidI must stop My wings are tired and Brom needs attention I discovered a good place to stay about two miles ahead of where you are They found her sitting at the base of a broad sandstone formation that curved out of the ground like a great hill Its sides were pocked with caves of varying sizes Similar domes were scattered across the land Saphira looked pleased with herselfI found a cave that cant be seen from the ground Its large enough for all of us including the horses Follow me She turned and climbed up the sandstone her sharp claws digging into the rock The horses had difficulty as their shod hooves could not grip the sandstone Eragon and Murtagh had to pull and shove the animals for almost an hour before they managed to reach the cave The cavern was a good hundred feet long and more than twenty feet wide yet it had a small opening that would protect them from bad weather and prying eyes Darkness swallowed the far end clinging to the walls like mats of soft black wool Impressive said Murtagh Ill gather wood for a fire Eragon hurried to Brom Saphira had set him on a small rock ledge at the rear of the cave Eragon clasped Broms limp hand and anxiously watched his craggy face After a few minutes he sighed and went to the fire Murtagh had built They ate quietly then tried to give Brom water but the old man would not drink Stymied they spread out their bedrolls and slept L EGACY OF ARIDER Wake up EragonHe stirred and groaned I need your helpSomething is wrongEragon tried to ignore the voice and return to sleep Arise Go awayhe grumbled EragonA bellow rang in the cave He bolted upright fumbling for his bow Saphira was crouched over Brom who had rolled off the ledge and was thrashing on the cave floor His face was contorted in a grimace his fists were clenched Eragon rushed over fearing the worst Help me hold him down Hes going to hurt himself he cried to Murtagh clasping Broms arms His side burned sharply as the old man spasmed Together they restrained Brom until his convulsions ceased Then they carefully returned him to the ledge Eragon touched Broms forehead The skin was so hot that the heat could be felt an inch away Get me water and a cloth he said worriedly Murtagh brought them and Eragon gently bathed Broms face trying to cool him down With the cave quiet again he noticed the sun shining outsideHow long did we sleep he asked Saphira A good while Ive been watching Brom for most of that time He was fine until a minute ago when he started thrashing I woke you once he fell to the floor He stretched wincing as his ribs twinged painfully A hand suddenly gripped his shoulder Broms eyes snapped opened and fixed a glassy stare on Eragon You he gasped Bring me the wineskin Brom exclaimed Eragon pleased to hear him talk You shouldnt drink wine itll only make you worse Bring it boyjust bring it sighed Brom His hand slipped off Eragons shoulder Ill be right backhold on Eragon dashed to the saddlebags and rummaged through them frantically I cant find it he cried looking around desperately Here take mine said Murtagh holding out a leather skin Eragon grabbed it and returned to Brom I have the wine he said kneeling Murtagh retreated to the caves mouth so they could have privacy Broms next words were faint and indistinct Good He moved his arm weakly Now wash my right hand with it What Eragon started to ask No questions I havent time Mystified Eragon unstoppered the wineskin and poured the liquid onto Broms palm He rubbed it into the old mans skin spreading it around the fingers and over the back of the hand More croaked Brom Eragon splashed wine onto his hand again He scrubbed vigorously as a brown dye floated off Broms palm then stopped his mouth agape with amazement There on Broms palm was the gedwëy ignasia Youre a Rider he asked incredulously A painful smile flickered on Broms face Once upon a time that was true but no more When I was young younger than you are now I was chosen chosen by the Riders to join their ranks While they trained me I became friends with another apprentice Morzan before he was a Forsworn Eragon gaspedthat had been over a hundred years ago But then he betrayed us to Galbatorix and in the fighting at Dorú AreabaVroengards citymy young dragon was killed Her name was Saphira Why didnt you tell me this before asked Eragon softly Brom laughed Because there was no need to He stopped His breathing was labored his hands were clenched I am old Eragon so old Though my dragon was killed my life has been longer than most You dont know what it is to reach my age look back and realize that you dont remember much of it then to look forward and know that many years still lie ahead of you After all this time I still grieve for my Saphira and hate Galbatorix for what he tore from me His feverish eyes drilled into Eragon as he said fiercely Dont let that happen to you Dont Guard Saphira with your life for without her its hardly worth living You shouldnt talk like this Nothings going to happen to her said Eragon worried Brom turned his head to the side Perhaps I am rambling His gaze passed blindly over Murtagh then he focused on Eragon Broms voice grew stronger Eragon I can not last much longer This this is a grievous wound it saps my strength I have not the energy to fight it Before I go will you take my blessing Everything will be all right said Eragon tears in his eyes You dont have to do this It is the way of things I must Will you take my blessing Eragon bowed his head and nodded overcome Brom placed a trembling hand on his brow Then I give it to you May the coming years bring you great happiness He motioned for Eragon to bend closer Very quietly he whispered seven words from the ancient language then even more softly told him what they meant That is all I can give you Use them only in great need Brom blindly turned his eyes to the ceiling And now he murmured for the greatest adventure of all Weeping Eragon held his hand comforting him as best he could His vigil was unwavering and steadfast unbroken by food or drink As the long hours passed a gray pallor crept over Brom and his eyes slowly dimmed His hands grew icy the air around him took on an evil humor Powerless to help Eragon could only watch as the Razacs wound took its toll The evening hours were young and the shadows long when Brom suddenly stiffened Eragon called his name and cried for Murtaghs help but they could do nothing As a barren silence dampened the air Brom locked his eyes with Eragons Then contentment spread across the old mans face and a whisper of breath escaped his lips And so it was that Brom the storyteller died With shaking fingers Eragon closed Broms eyes and stood Saphira raised her head behind him and roared mournfully at the sky keening her lamentation Tears rolled down Eragons cheeks as a sense of horrible loss bled through him Haltingly he said We have to bury him We might be seen warned Murtagh I dont care Murtagh hesitated then bore Broms body out of the cave along with his sword and staff Saphira followed them To the top Eragon said thickly indicating the crown of the sandstone hill We cant dig a grave out of stone objected Murtagh I can do it Eragon climbed onto the smooth hilltop struggling because of his ribs There Murtagh lay Brom on the stone Eragon wiped his eyes and fixed his gaze on the sandstone Gesturing with his hand he said Moi stenr The stone rippled It flowed like water forming a bodylength depression in the hilltop Molding the sandstone like wet clay he raised waisthigh walls around it They laid Brom inside the unfinished sandstone vault with his staff and sword Stepping back Eragon again shaped the stone with magic It joined over Broms motionless face and flowed upward into a tall faceted spire As a final tribute Eragon set runes into the stone HERELIESBROM Who was a Dragon Rider And like a father To me May his name live on in glory Then he bowed his head and mourned freely He stood like a living statue until evening when light faded from the land That night he dreamed of the imprisoned woman again He could tell that something was wrong with her Her breathing was irregular and she shookwhether from cold or pain he did not know In the semidarkness of the cell the only thing clearly illuminated was her hand which hung over the edge of the cot A dark liquid dripped from the tips of her fingers Eragon knew it was blood D IAMONDTOMB When Eragon woke his eyes were gritty his body stiff The cave was empty except for the horses The litter was gone no sign of Brom remained He walked to the entrance and sat on the pitted sandstoneSo the witch Angela was correctthere was a death in my future he thought staring bleakly at the land The topaz sun brought a desert heat to the early morning A tear slid down his listless face and evaporated in the sunlight leaving a salty crust on his skin He closed his eyes and absorbed the warmth emptying his mind With a fingernail he aimlessly scratched the sandstone When he looked he saw that he had writtenWhy me He was still there when Murtagh climbed up to the cave carrying a pair of rabbits Without a word he seated himself by Eragon How are you he asked Very ill Murtagh considered him thoughtfully Will you recover Eragon shrugged After a few minutes of reflection Murtagh said I dislike asking this at such a time but I must know Is your Bromthe Brom The one who helped steal a dragon egg from the king chased it across the Empire and killed Morzan in a duel I heard you say his name and I read the inscription you put on his grave but I must know for certain Was that he It was said Eragon softly A troubled expression settled on Murtaghs face How do you know all that You talk about things that are secret to most and you were trailing the Razac right when we needed help Are you one of the Varden Murtaghs eyes became inscrutable orbs Im running away like you There was restrained sorrow in his words I do not belong to either the Varden or the Empire Nor do I owe allegiance to any man but myself As for my rescuing you I will admit that Ive heard whispered tales of a new Rider and reasoned that by following the Razac I might discover if they were true I thought you wanted to kill the Razac said Eragon Murtagh smiled grimly I do but if I had I never would have met you But Brom would still be alive I wish he were here He would know whether to trust MurtaghEragon remembered how Brom had sensed Trevors intentions in Daret and wondered if he could do the same with Murtagh He reached for Murtaghs consciousness but his probe abruptly ran into an ironhard wall which he tried to circumvent Murtaghs entire mind was fortifiedHow did he learn to do that Brom said that few people if any could keep others out of their mind without training So who is Murtagh to have this ability Pensive and lonely Eragon asked Where is Saphira I dont know said Murtagh She followed me for a time when I went hunting then flew off on her own I havent seen her since before noon Eragon rocked onto his feet and returned to the cave Murtagh followed What are you going to do now Im not sureAnd I dont want to think about it either He rolled up his blankets and tied them to Cadocs saddlebags His ribs hurt Murtagh went to prepare the rabbits As Eragon shifted things in his bags he uncovered Zarroc The red sheath glinted brightly He took out the sword weighed it in his hands He had never carried Zarroc nor used it in combatexcept when he and Brom had sparredbecause he had not wanted people to see it That concerned Eragon no more The Razac had seemed surprised and frightened by the sword that was more than enough reason for him to wear it With a shudder he pulled off his bow and belted on ZarrocFrom this moment on Ill live by the sword Let the whole world see what I am I have no fear I am a Rider now fully and completely He sorted through Broms bags but found only clothes a few odd items and a small pouch of coins Eragon took the map of Alagaësia and put the bags away then crouched by the fire Murtaghs eyes narrowed as he looked up from the rabbit he was skinning That sword May I see it he asked wiping his hands Eragon hesitated reluctant to relinquish the weapon for even a moment then nodded Murtagh examined the symbol on the blade intently His face darkened Where did you get this Brom gave it to me Why Murtagh shoved the sword back and crossed his arms angrily He was breathing hard That sword he said with emotion was once as well known as its owner The last Rider to carry it was Morzana brutal savage man I thought you were a foe of the Empire yet here I find you bearing one of the Forsworns bloody swords Eragon stared at Zarroc with shock He realized that Brom must have taken it from Morzan after they fought in Gilead Brom never told me where it came from he said truthfully I had no idea it was Morzans He never told you asked Murtagh a note of disbelief in his voice Eragon shook his head Thats strange I can think of no reason for him to have concealed it Neither can I But then he kept many secrets said Eragon It felt unsettling to hold the sword of the man who had betrayed the Riders to GalbatorixThis blade probably killed many Riders in its time he thought with revulsionAnd worse dragons Even so Im going to carry it I dont have a sword of my own Until such time as I get one Ill use Zarroc Murtagh flinched as Eragon said the name Its your choice he said He returned to skinning keeping his gaze focused downward When the meal was ready Eragon ate slowly though he was quite hungry The hot food made him feel better As they scraped out their bowls he said I have to sell my horse Why not Broms asked Murtagh He seemed to have gotten over his bad temper Snowfire Because Brom promised to take care of him Since he isnt around Ill do it for him Murtagh set his bowl on his lap If thats what you want Im sure we can find a buyer in some town or village We asked Eragon Murtagh looked at him sideways in a calculating way You wont want to stay here for much longer If the Razac are nearby Broms tomb will be like a beacon for them Eragon had not thought of that And your ribs are going to take time to heal I know you can defend yourself with magic but you need a companion who can lift things and use a sword Im asking to travel with you at least for the time being But I must warn you the Empire is searching for me Therell be blood over it eventually Eragon laughed weakly and found himself crying because it hurt so much Once his breath was back he said I dont care if the entire army is searching for you Youre right I do need help I would be glad to have you along though I have to talk to Saphira about it But I have to warnyou Galbatorix justmight send the entire army after me You wont be any safer with Saphira and me than if you were on your own I know that said Murtagh with a quick grin But all the same it wont stop me Good Eragon smiled with gratitude While they spoke Saphira crawled into the cave and greeted Eragon She was glad to see him but there was deep sadness in her thoughts and words She laid her big blue head on the floor and askedAre you well again Not quite I miss the old one As do I I never suspected that he was a Rider Brom He really was an old manas old as the Forsworn Everything he taught me about magic he must have learned from the Riders themselves Saphira shifted slightlyI knew what he was the moment he touched me at your farm And you didnt tell me Why He asked me not to she said simply Eragon decided not to make an issue of it Saphira never meant to hurt him Brom kept more than that secrethe told her then explained about Zarroc and Murtaghs reaction to itI understand now why Brom didnt explain Zarrocs origins when he gave it to me If he had I probably would have run away from him at the first opportunity You would do well to rid yourself of that swordshe said with distasteI know its a peerless weapon but you would be better off with a normal blade rather than Morzans butchery tool Perhaps Saphira where does our path go from here Murtagh offered to come with us I dont know his past but he seems honest enough Should we go to the Varden now Only I dont know how to find them Brom never told us He told mesaid Saphira Eragon grew angryWhy did he trust you but not me with all this knowledge Her scales rustled over the dry rock as she stood above him eyes profoundAfter we left Teirm and were attacked by the Urgals he told me many things some of which I will not speak of unless necessary He was concerned about his own death and what would happen to you after it One fact he imparted to me was the name of a man Dormnad who lives in Gilead He can help us find the Varden Brom also wanted you to know that of all the people in Alagaësia he believed you were the best suited to inherit the Riders legacy Tears welled in Eragons eyes This was the highest praise he could have ever received from BromA responsibility I will bear honorably Good We will go to Gilead thenstated Eragon strength and purpose returning to himAnd what of Murtagh Do you think he should come with us We owe him our livessaid SaphiraBut even if that werent so he has seen both you and me We should keep him close so he doesnt furnish the Empire with our location and descriptions willingly or not He agreed with her then told Saphira about his dreamWhat I saw disturbed me I feel that time is running out for her something dreadful is going to happen soon Shes in mortal dangerIm sure of itbut I dont know how to find her She could be anywhere What does your heart sayasked Saphira My heart died a while backsaid Eragon with a hint of black humorHowever I think we should go north to Gilead With any luck one of the towns or cities along our path is where this woman is being held Im afraid that my next dream of her will show a grave I couldnt stand that Why Im not surehe said shruggingIts just that when I see her I feel as if shes precious and shouldnt be lost Its very strange Saphira opened her long mouth and laughed silently fangs gleamingWhat is it snapped Eragon She shook her head and quietly padded away Eragon grumbled to himself then told Murtagh what they had decided Murtagh said If you find this Dormnad and then continue on to the Varden I will leave you Encountering the Varden would be as dangerous for me as walking unarmed into Urûbaen with a fanfare of trumpets to announce my arrival We wont have to part anytime soon said Eragon Its a long way to Gilead His voice cracked slightly and he squinted at the sun to distract himself We should leave before the day grows any older Are you strong enough to travel asked Murtagh frowning I have to do something or Ill go crazy said Eragon brusquely Sparring practicing magic or sitting around twiddling my thumbs arent good options right now so I choose to ride They doused the fire packed and led the horses out of the cave Eragon handed Cadocs and Snowfires reins to Murtagh saying Go on Ill be right down Murtagh began the slow descent from the cave Eragon struggled up the sandstone resting when his side made it impossible to breathe When he reached the top he found Saphira already there They stood together before Broms grave and paid their last respectsI cant believe hes gone forever As Eragon turned to depart Saphira snaked out her long neck to touch the tomb with the tip of her nose Her sides vibrated as a low humming filled the air The sandstone around her nose shimmered like gilded dew turning clear with dancing silver highlights Eragon watched in wonder as tendrils of white diamond twisted over the tombs surface in a web of priceless filigree Sparkling shadows were cast on the ground reflecting splashes of brilliant colors that shifted dazzlingly as the sandstone continued to change With a satisfied snort Saphira stepped back and examined her handiwork The sculpted sandstone mausoleum of moments before had transformed into a sparkling gemstone vaultunder which Broms untouched face was visible Eragon gazed with yearning at the old man who seemed to be only sleeping What did you do he asked Saphira with awe I gave him the only gift I could Now time will not ravage him He can rest in peace for eternity Thank youEragon put a hand on her side and they left together C APTURE ATGILEAD Riding was extremely painful for Eragonhis broken ribs prevented them from going faster than a walk and it was impossible for him to breathe deeply without a burst of agony Nevertheless he refused to stop Saphira flew close by her mind linked with his for solace and strength Murtagh rode confidently beside Cadoc flowing smoothly with his horses movements Eragon watched the gray animal for a while You have a beautiful horse Whats his name Tornac after the man who taught me how to fight Murtagh patted the horses side He was given to me when he was just a foal Youd be hard pressed to find a more courageous and intelligent animal in all of Alagaësia Saphira excepted of course He is a magnificent beast said Eragon admiringly Murtagh laughed Yes but Snowfire is as close to his match as Ive ever seen They covered only a short distance that day yet Eragon was glad to be on the move again It kept his mind off other more morbid matters They were riding through unsettled land The road to DrasLeona was several leagues to their left They would skirt the city by a wide margin on the way to Gilead which was almost as far to the north as Carvahall They sold Cadoc in a small village As the horse was led away by his new owner Eragon regretfully pocketed the few coins he had gained from the transaction It was difficult to relinquish Cadoc after crossing half of Alagaësiaand outracing Urgalson him The days rolled by unnoticed as their small group traveled in isolation Eragon was pleased to find that he and Murtagh shared many of the same interests they spent hours debating the finer points of archery and hunting There was one subject however they avoided discussing by unspoken consent their pasts Eragon did not explain how he had found Saphira met Brom or where he came from Murtagh was likewise mute as to why the Empire was chasing him It was a simple arrangement but it worked Yet because of their proximity it was inevitable that they learned about each other Eragon was intrigued by Murtaghs familiarity with the power struggles and politics within the Empire He seemed to know what every noble and courtier was doing and how it affected everyone else Eragon listened carefully suspicions whirling through his mind The first week went by without any sign of the Razac which allayed some of Eragons fears Even so they still kept watches at night Eragon had expected to encounter Urgals on the way to Gilead but they found no trace of themI thought these remote places would be teeming with monsters he musedStill Im not one to complain if theyve gone elsewhere He dreamed of the woman no more And though he tried to scry her he saw only an empty cell Whenever they passed a town or city he checked to see if it had a jail If it did he would disguise himself and visit it but she was not to be found His disguises became increasingly elaborate as he saw notices featuring his name and descriptionand offering a substantial reward for his captureposted in various towns Their travels north forced them toward the capital Urûbaen It was a heavily populated area which made it difficult to escape notice Soldiers patrolled the roads and guarded the bridges It took them several tense irritable days to skirt the capital Once they were safely past Urûbaen they found themselves on the edge of a vast plain It was the same one that Eragon had crossed after leaving Palancar Valley except now he was on the opposite side They kept to the perimeter of the plain and continued north following the Ramr River Eragons sixteenth birthday came and went during this time At Carvahall a celebration would have been held for his entrance into manhood but in the wilderness he did not even mention it to Murtagh At nearly six months of age Saphira was much larger Her wings were massive every inch of them was needed to lift her muscular body and thick bones The fangs that jutted from her jaw were nearly as thick around as Eragons fist their points as sharp as Zarroc The day finally came when Eragon unwrapped his side for the last time His ribs had healed completely leaving him with only a small scar where the Razacs boot had cut his side As Saphira watched he stretched slowly then with increasing vigor when there was no pain He flexed his muscles pleased In an earlier time he would have smiled but after Broms death such expressions did not come easily He tugged his tunic on and walked back to the small fire they had made Murtagh sat next to it whittling a piece of wood Eragon drew Zarroc Murtagh tensed though his face remained calm Now that I am strong enough would you like to spar asked Eragon Murtagh tossed the wood to the side With sharpened swords We could kill each other Here give me your sword said Eragon Murtagh hesitated then handed over his long handandahalf sword Eragon blocked the edges with magic the way Brom had taught him While Murtagh examined the blade Eragon said I can undo that once were finished Murtagh checked the balance of his sword Satisfied he said It will do Eragon safed Zarroc settled into a crouch then swung at Murtaghs shoulder Their swords met in midair Eragon disengaged with a flourish thrust and then riposted as Murtagh parried dancing away Hes fastthought Eragon They struggled back and forth trying to batter each other down After a particularly intense series of blows Murtagh started laughing Not only was it impossible for either of them to gain an advantage but they were so evenly matched that they tired at the same rate Acknowledging with grins each others skill they fought on until their arms were leaden and sweat poured off their sides Finally Eragon called Enough halt Murtagh stopped in midblow and sat down with a gasp Eragon staggered to the ground his chest heaving None of his fights with Brom had been this fierce As he gulped air Murtagh exclaimed Youre amazing Ive studied swordplay all my life but never have I fought one like you You could be the kings weapon master if you wanted to Youre just as good observed Eragon still panting The man who taught you Tornac could make a fortune with a fencing school People would come from all parts of Alagaësia to learn from him Hes dead said Murtagh shortly Im sorry Thus it became their custom to fight in the evening which kept them lean and fit like a pair of matched blades With his return to health Eragon also resumed practicing magic Murtagh was curious about it and soon revealed that he knew a surprising amount about how it worked though he lacked the precise details and could not use it himself Whenever Eragon practiced speaking in the ancient language Murtagh would listen quietly occasionally asking what a word meant On the outskirts of Gilead they stopped the horses side by side It had taken them nearly a month to reach it during which time spring had finally nudged away the remnants of winter Eragon had felt himself changing during the trip growing stronger and calmer He still thought about Brom and spoke about him with Saphira but for the most part he tried not to awaken painful memories From a distance they could see the city was a rough barbaric place filled with log houses and yapping dogs There was a rambling stone fortress at its center The air was hazy with blue smoke The place seemed more like a temporary trading post than a permanent city Five miles beyond it was the hazy outline of Isenstar Lake They decided to camp two miles from the city for safety While their dinner simmered Murtagh said Im not sure you should be the one to go into Gilead Why I can disguise myself well enough said Eragon And Dormnad will want to see the gedwëy ignasia as proof that I really am a Rider Perhaps said Murtagh but the Empire wants you much more than me If Im captured I could eventually escape But ifyou are taken theyll drag you to the king where youll be in for a slow death by tortureunless you join him Plus Gilead is one of the armys major staging points Those arent houses out there theyre barracks Going in there would be like handing yourself to the king on a gilded platter Eragon asked Saphira for her opinion She wrapped her tail around his legs and lay next to himYou shouldnt have to ask me he speaks sense There are certain words I can give him that will convince Dormnad of his truthfulness And Murtaghs right if anyone is to risk capture it should be him because he would live through it He grimacedI dont like letting him put himself in danger for us All right you can go he said reluctantly But if anything goes wrong Im coming after you Murtagh laughed That would be fit for a legend how a lone Rider took on the kings army singlehandedly He chuckled again and stood Is there anything I should know before going Shouldnt we rest and wait until tomorrow asked Eragon cautiously Why The longer we stay here the greater the chance that well be discovered If this Dormnad can take you to the Varden then he needs to be found as quickly as possible Neither of us should remain near Gilead longer than a few days Again wisdom flies from his mouthcommented Saphira dryly She told Eragon what should be said to Dormnad and he relayed the information to Murtagh Very well said Murtagh adjusting his sword Unless theres trouble Ill be back within a couple of hours Make sure theres some food left for me With a wave of his hand he jumped onto Tornac and rode away Eragon sat by the fire tapping Zarrocs pommel apprehensively Hours passed but Murtagh did not return Eragon paced around the fire Zarroc in hand while Saphira watched Gilead attentively Only her eyes moved Neither of them voiced their worries though Eragon unobtrusively prepared to leavein case a detachment of soldiers left the city and headed toward their camp Looksnapped Saphira Eragon swiveled toward Gilead alert He saw a distant horseman exit the city and ride furiously toward their campI dont like this he said as he climbed onto SaphiraBe ready to fly Im prepared for more than that As the rider approached Eragon recognized Murtagh bent low over Tornac No one seemed to be pursuing him but he did not slow his reckless pace He galloped into the camp and jumped to the ground drawing his sword Whats wrong asked Eragon Murtagh scowled Did anyone follow me from Gilead We didnt see anyone Good Then let me eat before I explain Im starving He seized a bowl and began eating with gusto After a few sloppy bites he said through a full mouth Dormnad has agreed to meet us outside Gilead at sunrise tomorrow If hes satisfied you really are a Rider and that its not a trap hell take you to the Varden Where are we supposed to meet him asked Eragon Murtagh pointed west On a small hill across the road So what happened Murtagh spooned more food into his bowl Its a rather simple thing but all the more deadly because of it I was seen in the street by someone who knows me I did the only thing I could and ran away It was too late though he recognized me It was unfortunate but Eragon was unsure how bad it really was Since I dont know your friend I have to ask Will he tell anyone Murtagh gave a strained laugh If youhad met him that wouldnt need answering His mouth is loosely hinged and hangs open all the time vomiting whatever happens to be in his mind The question isntwhether he will tell people butwhom he will tell If word of this reaches the wrong ears well be in trouble I doubt that soldiers will be sent to search for you in the dark Eragon pointed out We can at least count on being safe until morning and by then if all goes well well be leaving with Dormnad Murtagh shook his head No only you will accompany him As I said before I wont go to the Varden Eragon stared at him unhappily He wanted Murtagh to stay They had become friends during their travels and he was loath to tear that apart He started to protest but Saphira hushed him and said gentlyWait until tomorrow Now is not the time Very wellhe said glumly They talked until the stars were bright in the sky then slept as Saphira took the first watch Eragon woke two hours before dawn his palm tingling Everything was still and quiet but something sought his attention like an itch in his mind He buckled on Zarroc and stood careful not to make a sound Saphira looked at him curiously her large eyes brightWhat is it she asked I dont knowsaid Eragon He saw nothing amiss Saphira sniffed the air curiously She hissed a little and lifted her head I smell horses nearby but theyre not moving They reek with an unfamiliar stench Eragon crept to Murtagh and shook his shoulder Murtagh woke with a start yanked a dagger from under his blankets then looked at Eragon quizzically Eragon motioned for him to be silent whispering There are horses close by Murtagh wordlessly drew his sword They quietly stationed themselves on either side of Saphira prepared for an attack As they waited the morning star rose in the east A squirrel chattered Then an angry snarl from behind made Eragon spin around sword held high A broad Urgal stood at the edge of the camp carrying a mattock with a nasty spikeWhere did he come from We havent seen their tracks anywhere thought Eragon The Urgal roared and waved his weapon but did not charge Brisingr barked Eragon stabbing out with magic The Urgals face contorted with terror as he exploded in a flash of blue light Blood splattered Eragon and a brown mass flew through the air Behind him Saphira bugled with alarm and reared Eragon twisted around While he had been occupied with the first Urgal a group of them had run up from the sideOf all the stupid tricks to fall for Steel clashed loudly as Murtagh attacked the Urgals Eragon tried to join him but was blocked by four of the monsters The first one swung a sword at his shoulder He ducked the blow and killed the Urgal with magic He caught a second one in the throat with Zarroc wheeled wildly and slashed a third through the heart As he did the fourth Urgal rushed at him swinging a heavy club Eragon saw him coming and tried to lift his sword to block the club but was a second too slow As the club came down on his head he screamed Fly Saphira A burst of light filled his eyes and he lost consciousness D USÚNDAVARFREOHR The first things Eragon noticed were that he was warm and dry his cheek was pressed against rough fabric and his hands were unbound He stirred but it was minutes before he was able to push himself upright and examine his surroundings He was sitting in a cell on a narrow bumpy cot A barred window was set high in the wall The ironbound door with a small window in its top half barred like the one in the wall was shut securely Dried blood cracked on Eragons face when he moved It took him a moment to remember that it was not his His head hurt horriblywhich was to be expected considering the blow he had takenand his mind was strangely fuzzy He tried to use magic but could not concentrate well enough to remember any of the ancient wordsThey must have drugged me he finally decided With a groan he got up missing the familiar weight of Zarroc on his hip and lurched to the window in the wall He managed to see out of it by standing on his toes It took a minute for his eyes to adjust to the bright light outside The window was level with the ground A street full of busy people ran past the side of his cell beyond which were rows of identical log houses Feeling weak Eragon slid to the floor and stared at it blankly What he had seen outside disturbed him but he was unsure why Cursing his sluggish thinking he leaned back his head and tried to clear his mind A man entered the room and set a tray of food and a pitcher of water on the cotWasnt that nice of him thought Eragon smiling pleasantly He took a couple of bites of the thin cabbage soup and stale bread but was barely able to stomach itI wish he had brought me something better he complained dropping the spoon He suddenly realized what was wrongI was captured by Urgals not men How did I end up here His befuddled brain grappled with the paradox unsuccessfully With a mental shrug he filed the discovery away for a time when he would know what to do with it He sat on the cot and gazed into the distance Hours later more food was brought inAnd I was just getting hungry he thought thickly This time he was able to eat without feeling sick When he finished he decided it was time for a nap After all he was on a bed what else was he going to do His mind drifted off sleep began to envelop him Then a gate clanged open somewhere and the din of steelshod boots marching on a stone floor filled the air The noise grew louder and louder until it sounded like someone banging a pot inside Eragons head He grumbled to himselfCant they let me rest in peace Fuzzy curiosity slowly overcame his exhaustion so he dragged himself to the door blinking like an owl Through the window he saw a wide hallway nearly ten yards across The opposing wall was lined with cells similar to his own A column of soldiers marched through the hall their swords drawn and ready Every man was dressed in matching armor their faces bore the same hard expression and their feet came down on the floor with mechanical precision never missing a beat The sound was hypnotic It was an impressive display of force Eragon watched the soldiers until he grew bored Just then he noticed a break in the middle of the column Carried between two burly men was an unconscious woman Her long midnightblack hair obscured her face despite a leather strip bound around her head to hold the tresses back She was dressed in dark leather pants and shirt Wrapped around her slim waist was a shiny belt from which hung an empty sheath on her right hip Kneehigh boots covered her calves and small feet Her head lolled to the side Eragon gasped feeling like he had been struck in the stomach She was the woman from his dreams Her sculpted face was as perfect as a painting Her round chin high cheekbones and long eyelashes gave her an exotic look The only mar in her beauty was a scrape along her jaw nevertheless she was the fairest woman he had ever seen Eragons blood burned as he looked at her Something awoke in himsomething he had never felt before It was like an obsession except stronger almost a fevered madness Then the womans hair shifted revealing pointed ears A chill crept over him She was an elf The soldiers continued marching taking her from his sight Next strode a tall proud man a sable cape billowing behind him His face was deathly white his hair was red Red like blood As he walked by Eragons cell the man turned his head and looked squarely at him with maroon eyes His upper lip pulled back in a feral smile revealing teeth filed to points Eragon shrank back He knew what the man wasA ShadeSo help me a Shade The procession continued and the Shade vanished from view Eragon sank to the floor hugging himself Even in his bewildered state he knew that the presence of a Shade meant that evil was loose in the land Whenever they appeared rivers of blood were sure to followWhat is a Shade doing here The soldiers should have killed him on sight Then his thoughts returned to the elfwoman and he was grasped by strange emotions again I have to escapeBut with his mind clouded his determination quickly faded He returned to the cot By the time the hallway fell silent he was fast asleep As soon as Eragon opened his eyes he knew something was different It was easier for him to think he realized that he was in GileadThey made a mistake the drugs wearing off Hopeful he tried to contact Saphira and use magic but both activities were still beyond his reach A pit of worry twisted inside him as he wondered if she and Murtagh had managed to escape He stretched his arms and looked out the window The city was just awakening the street was empty except for two beggars He reached for the water pitcher ruminating about the elf and Shade As he started to drink he noticed that the water had a faint odor as if it contained a few drops of rancid perfume Grimacing he set the pitcher downThe drug must be in there and maybe in the food as well He remembered that when the Razac had drugged him it had taken hours to wear offIf I can keep from drinking and eating for long enough I should be able to use magic Then I can rescue the elf The thought made him smile He sat in a corner dreaming about how it could be done The portly jailer entered the cell an hour later with a tray of food Eragon waited until he departed then carried the tray to the window The meal was composed only of bread cheese and an onion but the smell made his stomach grumble hungrily Resigning himself to a miserable day he shoved the food out the window and onto the street hoping that no one would notice Eragon devoted himself to overcoming the drugs effects He had difficulty concentrating for any length of time but as the day progressed his mental acuity increased He began to remember several of the ancient words though nothing happened when he uttered them He wanted to scream with frustration When lunch was delivered he pushed it out the window after his breakfast His hunger was distracting but it was the lack of water that taxed him most The back of his throat was parched Thoughts of drinking cool water tortured him as each breath dried his mouth and throat a bit more Even so he forced himself to ignore the pitcher He was diverted from his discomfort by a commotion in the hall A man argued in a loud voice You cant go in there The orders were clear no one is to see him Really Will you be the one to die stopping me Captain cut in a smooth voice There was a subdued No but the king Iwill handle the king interrupted the second person Now unlock the door After a pause keys jangled outside Eragons cell He tried to adopt a languorous expressionI have to act like I dont understand whats going on I cant show surprise no matter what this person says The door opened His breath caught as he looked into the Shades face It was like gazing at a death mask or a polished skull with skin pulled over it to give the appearance of life Greetings said the Shade with a cold smile showing his filed teeth Ive waited a long time to meet you Whowhore you asked Eragon slurring his words No one of consequence answered the Shade his maroon eyes alight with controlled menace He sat with a flourish of his cloak My name does not matter to one in your position It wouldnt mean a thing to you anyway Its you that Im interested in Who are you The question was posed innocently enough but Eragon knew there had to be a catch or trap in it though it eluded him He pretended to struggle over the question for a while then slowly said frowning Im not sure Mnames Eragon but thats not all I am is it The Shades narrow lips stretched tautly over his mouth as he laughed sharply No it isnt You have an interesting mind my young Rider He leaned forward The skin on his forehead was thin and translucent It seems I must be more direct What is your name Era No Not that one The Shade cut him off with a wave of his hand Dont you have another one one that you use only rarely He wants my true name so he can control merealized EragonBut I cant tell him I dont even know it myself He thought quickly trying to invent a deception that would conceal his ignoranceWhat if I made up a name He hesitatedit could easily give him awaythen raced to create a name that would withstand scrutiny As he was about to utter it he decided to take a chance and try to scare the Shade He deftly switched a few letters then nodded foolishly and said Brom told it to me once It was The pause stretched for a few seconds then his face brightened as he appeared to remember It was Du Súndavar Freohr Which meant almost literally death of the shadows A grim chill settled over the cell as the Shade sat motionless eyes veiled He seemed to be deep in thought pondering what he had learned Eragon wondered if he had dared too much He waited until the Shade stirred before asking ingenuously Why are you here The Shade looked at him with contempt in his red eyes and smiled To gloat of course What use is a victory if one can not enjoy it There was confidence in his voice but he seemed uneasy as if his plans had been disrupted He stood suddenly I must attend to certain matters but while I am gone you would do well to think on who you would rather serve a Rider who betrayed your own order or a fellow man like me though one skilled in arcane arts When the time comes to choose there will be no middle ground He turned to leave then glanced at Eragons water pitcher and stopped his face granite hard Captain he snapped A broadshouldered man rushed into the cell sword in hand What is it my lord he asked alarmed Put that toy away instructed the Shade He turned to Eragon and said in a deadly quiet voice The boy hasnt been drinking his water Why is that I talked with the jailer earlier Every bowl and plate was scraped clean Very well said the Shade mollified But make sure that he starts drinking again He leaned toward the captain and murmured into his ear Eragon caught the last few words extra dose just in case The captain nodded The Shade returned his attention to Eragon We will talk again tomorrow when I am not so pressed for time You should know I have an endless fascination for names I will greatly enjoy discussing yours inmuch greater detail The way he said it gave Eragon a sinking feeling Once they left he lay on the cot and closed his eyes Broms lessons proved their worth now he relied on them to keep himself from panicking and to reassure himselfEverything has been provided for me I only have to take advantage of it His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of approaching soldiers Apprehensive he went to the door and saw two soldiers dragging the elf down the hallway When he could see her no more Eragon slumped to the floor and tried to touch the magic again Oaths flew from his lips when it eluded his grasp He looked out at the city and ground his teeth It was only midafternoon Taking a calming breath he tried to wait patiently F IGHTINGSHADOWS It was dark in Eragons cell when he sat up with a start electrified The wrinkle had shifted He had felt the magic at the edge of his consciousness for hours but every time he tried to use it nothing happened Eyes bright with nervous energy he clenched his hands and said Nagz reisa With a flap the cots blanket flew into the air and crumpled into a ball the size of his fist It landed on the floor with a soft thump Exhilarated Eragon stood He was weak from his enforced fast but his excitement overcame his hungerNow for the real test He reached out with his mind and felt the lock on the door Instead of trying to break or cut it he simply pushed its internal mechanism into the unlocked position With a click the door creaked inward When he had first used magic to kill the Urgals in Yazuac it had consumed nearly all of his strength but he had grown much stronger since then What once would have exhausted him now only tired him slightly He cautiously stepped into the hallI have to find Zarroc and the elf She must be in one of these cells but there isnt time to look in them all As for Zarroc the Shade might have it with him He realized that his thinking was still muddledWhy am I out here I could escape right now if I went back into the cell and opened the window with magic But then I wouldnt be able to rescue the elf Saphira where are you I need your help He silently berated himself for not contacting her sooner That should have been the first thing he did after getting his power back Her reply came with surprising alacrityEragon Im over Gilead Dont do anything Murtagh is on the way What areFootsteps interrupted him He spun around crouching as a squad of six soldiers marched into the hall They halted abruptly eyes flicking between Eragon and the open cell door Blood drained from their facesGood they know who I amMaybe I can scare them off so we wont have to fight Charge yelled one of the soldiers running forward The rest of the men drew their blades and pounded down the hall It was madness to fight six men when he was unarmed and weak but the thought of the elf kept him in place He could not force himself to abandon her Uncertain if the effort would leave him standing he pulled on his power and raised his hand the gedwëy ignasia glowing Fear showed in the soldiers eyes but they were hardened warriors and did not slow As Eragon opened his mouth to pronounce the fatal words there was a low buzz a flicker of motion One of the men crashed to the floor with an arrow in his back Two more were struck before anyone understood what was happening At the end of the hall where the soldiers had entered stood a ragged bearded man with a bow A crutch lay on the floor by his feet apparently unneeded for he stood tall and straight The three remaining soldiers turned to face this new threat Eragon took advantage of the confusion Thrysta he shouted One of the men clutched his chest and fell Eragon staggered as the magic took its toll Another soldier fell pierced through the neck with an arrow Dont kill him called Eragon seeing his rescuer take aim at the last soldier The bearded man lowered his bow Eragon concentrated on the soldier before him The man was breathing hard the whites of his eyes showed He seemed to understand that his life was being spared Youve seen what I can do said Eragon harshly If you dont answer my questions the rest of your life will be spent in utter misery and torment Now wheres my swordits sheath and blade are redand what cell is the elf in The man clamped his mouth shut Eragons palm glowed ominously as he reached for the magic That was the wrong answer he snapped Do you know how much pain a grain of sand can cause you when its embedded red hot in your stomach Especially when it doesnt cool off for the next twenty years and slowly burns its way down to your toes By the time it gets out of you youll be an old man He paused for effect Unless you tell me what I want The soldiers eyes bulged but he remained silent Eragon scraped some dirt off the stone floor and observed dispassionately This is a bit more than a piece of sand but be comforted itll burn through you faster Still itll leave a bigger hole At his word the dirt shone cherry red though it did not burn his hand All right just dont put that in me yelped the soldier The elfs in the last cell to the left I dont know about your sword but its probably in the guardroom upstairs All the weapons are there Eragon nodded then murmured Slytha The soldiers eyes rolled up in his head and he collapsed limply Did you kill him Eragon looked at the stranger who was now only a few paces away He narrowed his eyes trying to see past the beard Murtagh Is that you he exclaimed Yes said Murtagh briefly lifting the beard from his shaven face I dont want my face seen Did you kill him No hes only asleep How did you get in Theres no time to explain We have to get up to the next floor before anyone finds us Therell be an escape route for us in a few minutes We dont want to miss it Didnt you hear what I said asked Eragon gesturing at the unconscious soldier Theres an elf in the prison I saw her We have to rescue her I need your help An elf Murtagh hurried down the hall growling This is a mistake We should flee while we have the chance He stopped before the cell the soldier had indicated and produced a ring of keys from under his ragged cloak I took it from one of the guards he explained Eragon motioned for the keys Murtagh shrugged and handed them to him Eragon found the right one and swung the door open A single beam of moonlight slanted through the window illuminating the elfs face with cool silver She faced him tense and coiled ready for whatever would happen next She held her head high with a queens demeanor Her eyes dark green almost black and slightly angled like a cats lifted to Eragons Chills shot through him Their gaze held for a moment then the elf trembled and collapsed soundlessly Eragon barely caught her before she struck the floor She was surprisingly light The aroma of freshly crushed pine needles surrounded her Murtagh entered the cell Shes beautiful But hurt We can tend to her later Are you strong enough to carry her Eragon shook his head Then Ill do it said Murtagh as he slung the elf across his shoulders Now upstairs He handed Eragon a dagger then hurried back into the hall littered with soldiers bodies With heavy footsteps Murtagh led Eragon to a stonehewn staircase at the end of the hall As they climbed it Eragon asked How are we going to get out without being noticed Were not grunted Murtagh That did not allay Eragons fears He listened anxiously for soldiers or anyone else who might be nearby dreading what might happen if they met the Shade At the head of the stairs was a banquet room filled with broad wooden tables Shields lined the walls and the wood ceiling was trussed with curved beams Murtagh laid the elf on a table and looked at the ceiling worriedly Can you talk to Saphira for me Yes Tell her to wait another five minutes There were shouts in the distance Soldiers marched past the entrance to the banquet room Eragons mouth tightened with pentup tension Whatever youre planning to do I dont think we have much time Just tell her and stay out of sight snapped Murtagh running off As Eragon relayed the message he was alarmed to hear men coming up the stairs Fighting hunger and exhaustion he dragged the elf off the table and hid her underneath it He crouched next to her holding his breath tightly clenching the dagger Ten soldiers entered the room They swept through it hurriedly looking under only a couple of tables and continued on their way Eragon leaned against a table leg sighing The respite made him suddenly aware of his burning stomach and parched throat A tankard and a plate of halfeaten food on the other side of the room caught his attention Eragon dashed from his hiding place grabbed the food then scurried back to the table There was amber beer in the tankard which he drank in two great gulps Relief seeped through him as the cool liquid ran down his throat soothing the irritated tissue He suppressed a belch before ravenously tearing into a hunk of bread Murtagh returned carrying Zarroc a strange bow and an elegant sword without a sheath Murtagh gave Zarroc to Eragon I found the other sword and bow in the guardroom Ive never seen weapons like them before so I assumed they were the elfs Lets find out said Eragon through a mouthful of bread The swordslim and light with a curved crossguard the ends of which narrowed into sharp pointsfit the elfs sheath perfectly There was no way to tell if the bow was hers but it was shaped so gracefully he doubted it could be anyone elses What now he asked cramming another bite of food into his mouth We cant stay here forever Sooner or later the soldiers will find us Now said Murtagh taking out his own bow and fitting an arrow to the string we wait Like I said our escape has been arranged You dont understand theres a Shade here If he finds us were doomed A Shade exclaimed Murtagh In that case tell Saphira to come immediately We were going to wait until the watch changed but delaying even that long is too dangerous now Eragon relayed the message succinctly refraining from distracting Saphira with questions You messed up my plans by escaping yourself groused Murtagh watching the rooms entrances for soldiers Eragon smiled In that case perhaps I should have waitedYour timing was perfect though I wouldnt have been able to even crawl if I had been forced to fight all those soldiers with magic Glad to be of some use remarked Murtagh He stiffened as they heard men running nearby Lets just hope the Shade doesnt find us A cold chuckle filled the banquet room Im afraid its far too late for that Murtagh and Eragon spun around The Shade stood alone at the end of the room In his hand was a pale sword with a thin scratch on the blade He unclasped the brooch that held his cape in place and let the garment fall to the floor His body was like a runners thin and compact but Eragon remembered Broms warning and knew that the Shades appearance was deceiving he was many times stronger than a normal human So my youngRider do you wish to test yourself against me sneered the Shade I shouldnt have trusted the captain when he said you ate all your food I will not make that mistake again Ill take care of him said Murtagh quietly putting down his bow and drawing his sword No said Eragon under his breath He wants me alive not you I can stall him for a short while but then youd better have a way out for us Fine go said Murtagh You wont have to hold him off for long I hope not said Eragon grimly He drew Zarroc and slowly advanced The red blade glinted with light from torches on the wall The Shades maroon eyes burned like coals He laughed softly Do you really think to defeat me Du Súndavar Freohr What a pitiful name I would have expected something more subtle from you but I suppose thats all youre capable of Eragon refused to let himself be goaded He stared at the Shades face waiting for a flicker of his eyes or twitch of his lip anything that would betray his next moveI cant use magic for fear of provoking him to do the same He has to think that he can win without resorting to itwhich he probably can Before either of them moved the ceiling boomed and shook Dust billowed from it and turned the air gray while pieces of wood fell around them shattering on the floor From the roof came screams and the sound of clashing metal Afraid of being brained by the falling timber Eragon flicked his eyes upward The Shade took advantage of his distraction and attacked Eragon barely managed to get Zarroc up in time to block a slash at his ribs Their blades met with a clang that jarred his teeth and numbed his armHellfire Hes strong He grasped Zarroc with both hands and swung with all of his might at the Shades head The Shade blocked him with ease whipping his sword through the air faster than Eragon had thought possible Terrible screeches sounded above them like iron spikes being drawn across rock Three long cracks split the ceiling Shingles from the slate roof fell through the fissures Eragon ignored them even when one smashed into the floor next to him Though he had trained with a master of the blade Brom and with Murtagh who was also a deadly swordsman he had never been this outclassed The Shade wasplaying with him Eragon retreated toward Murtagh arms trembling as he parried the Shades blows Each one seemed more powerful than the last Eragon was no longer strong enough to call upon magic for help even if he had wanted to Then with a contemptuous flick of his wrist the Shade knocked Zarroc out of Eragons hand The force of the blow sent him to his knees where he stayed panting The screeching was louder than ever Whatever was happening it was getting closer The Shade stared down at him haughtily A powerful piece you may be in the game that is being played but Im disappointed that this is your best If the other Riders were this weak they must have controlled the Empire only through sheer numbers Eragon looked up and shook his head He had figured out Murtaghs planSaphira now would be a good time No you forget something And what might that be asked the Shade mockingly There was a thunderous reverberation as a chunk of the ceiling was torn away to reveal the night sky The dragons roared Eragon over the noise and threw himself out of the Shades reach The Shade snarled in rage swinging his sword viciously He missed and lunged Surprise spread across his face as one of Murtaghs arrows sprouted from his shoulder The Shade laughed and snapped the arrow off with two fingers Youll have to do better than that if you want to stop me The next arrow caught him between the eyes The Shade howled with agony and writhed covering his face His skin turned gray Mist formed in the air around him obscuring his figure There was a shattering cry then the cloud vanished Where the Shade had been nothing was left but his cape and a pile of clothes You killed him exclaimed Eragon He knew of only two heroes of legend who had survived slaying a Shade Im not so sure said Murtagh A man shouted Thats it He failed Go in and get them Soldiers with nets and spears poured into the banquet room from both ends Eragon and Murtagh backed up against the wall dragging the elf with them The men formed a menacing halfcircle around them Then Saphira stuck her head through the hole in the ceiling and roared She gripped the edge of the opening with her powerful talons and ripped off another large section of the ceiling Three soldiers turned and ran but the rest held their positions With a resounding report the center beam of the ceiling cracked and rained down heavy shingles Confusion scattered the ranks as they tried to dodge the deadly barrage Eragon and Murtagh pressed against the wall to avoid the falling debris Saphira roared again and the soldiers fled some getting crushed on the way With a final titanic effort Saphira tore off the rest of the ceiling before jumping into the banquet hall with her wings folded Her weight splintered a table with a sharp crunch Crying out with relief Eragon threw his arms around her She hummed contentedlyIve missed you little one Same here Theres someone else with us Can you carry three Of courseshe said kicking shingles and tables out of the way so she could take off Murtagh and Eragon pulled the elf out of hiding Saphira hissed in surprise as she saw herAn elf Yes and the woman I saw in my dreamssaid Eragon picking up Zarroc He helped Murtagh secure the elf into the saddle then they both climbed onto SaphiraI heard fighting on the roof Are there men up there There were but no more Are you ready Yes Saphira leapt out of the banquet hall and onto the fortresss roof where the bodies of watchmen lay scattered Look said Murtagh pointing A row of archers filed out of a tower on the other side of the roofless hall Saphira you have to take off Now warned Eragon She unfurled her wings ran toward the edge of the building and propelled them over it with her powerful legs The extra weight on her back made her drop alarmingly As she struggled to gain altitude Eragon heard the musical twang of bowstrings being released Arrows whizzed toward them in the dark Saphira roared with pain as she was struck and quickly rolled to the left to avoid the next volley More arrows perforated the sky but the night protected them from the shafts deadly bite Distressed Eragon bent over Saphiras neckWhere are you hurt My wings are pierced one of the arrows didnt go all the way through Its still thereHer breathing was labored and heavy How far can you take us Far enoughEragon clutched the elf tightly as they skimmed over Gilead then left the city behind and veered eastward soaring upward through the night AW ARRIOR AND AHEALER Saphira drifted down to a clearing landed on the crest of a hill and rested her outstretched wings on the ground Eragon could feel her shaking beneath him They were only a halfleague from Gilead Picketed in the clearing were Snowfire and Tornac who snorted nervously at Saphiras arrival Eragon slid to the ground and immediately turned to Saphiras injuries while Murtagh readied the horses Unable to see well in the darkness Eragon ran his hands blindly over Saphiras wings He found three places where arrows had punctured the thin membrane leaving bloody holes as thick around as his thumb A small piece had also been torn out of the back edge of her left wing She shivered when his fingers brushed the injuries He tiredly healed the wounds with words from the ancient language Then he went to the arrow that was embedded in one of the large muscles of her flying arm The arrowhead poked through its underside Warm blood dripped off it Eragon called Murtagh over and instructed Hold her wing down I have to remove this arrow He indicated where Murtagh should gripThis will be painful he warned Saphirabut itll be over quickly Try not to struggleyoull hurt us She extended her neck and grabbed a tall sapling between her curved teeth With a yank of her head she pulled the tree out of the ground and clamped it firmly in her jawsIm ready Okaysaid Eragon Hold on he whispered to Murtagh then broke off the head of the arrow Trying not cause any more damage he swiftly pulled the shaft out of Saphira As it left her muscle she threw back her head and whimpered past the tree in her mouth Her wing jerked involuntarily clipping Murtagh under the chin and knocking him to the ground With a growl Saphira shook the tree spraying them with dirt before tossing it away After Eragon sealed the wound he helped Murtagh up She caught me by surprise admitted Murtagh touching his scraped jaw Im sorry She didnt mean to hit you assured Eragon He checked on the unconscious elfYoure going to have to carry her a bit longer he told SaphiraWe cant take her on the horses and ride fast enough Flying should be easier for you now that the arrow is out Saphira dipped her headI will do it Thank yousaid Eragon He hugged her fiercelyWhat you did was incredible Ill never forget it Her eyes softenedI will go now He backed away as she flew up in a flurry of air the elfs hair streaming back Seconds later they were gone Eragon hurried to Snowfire pulled himself into the saddle and galloped away with Murtagh While they rode Eragon tried to remember what he knew about elves They had long livesthat fact was oft repeatedalthough he knew not how long They spoke the ancient language and many could use magic After the Riders fall elves had retreated into seclusion None of them had been seen in the Empire sinceSo why is one here now And how did the Empire manage to capture her If she can use magic shes probably drugged as I was They traveled through the night not stopping even when their flagging strength began to slow them They continued onward despite burning eyes and clumsy movements Behind them lines of torchbearing horsemen searched around Gilead for their trail After many bleary hours dawn lightened the sky By unspoken consent Eragon and Murtagh stopped the horses We have to make camp said Eragon wearily I must sleepwhether they catch us or not Agreed said Murtagh rubbing his eyes Have Saphira land Well meet her They followed Saphiras directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a small cliff the elf still slouched on her back Saphira greeted them with a soft bugle as Eragon dismounted Murtagh helped him remove the elf from Saphiras saddle and lower her to the ground Then they sagged against the rock face exhausted Saphira examined the elf curiouslyI wonder why she hasnt woken Its been hours since we left Gilead Who knows what they did to hersaid Eragon grimly Murtagh followed their gaze As far as I know shes the first elf the king has captured Ever since they went into hiding hes been looking for them without successuntil now So hes either found their sanctuary or she was captured by chance I think it was chance If he had found the elf haven he would have declared war and sent his army after the elves Since that hasnt happened the question is Were Galbatorixs men able to extract the elves location before we rescued her We wont know until she regains consciousness Tell me what happened after I was captured How did I end up in Gilead The Urgals are working for the Empire said Murtagh shortly pushing back his hair And it seems the Shade as well Saphira and I saw the Urgals give you to himthough I didnt know who it was at the timeand a group of soldiers They were the ones who took you to Gilead Its truesaid Saphira curling up next to them Eragons mind flashed back to the Urgals he had spoken with at Teirm and the master they had mentionedThey meant the king I insulted the most powerful man in Alagaësia he realized with dread Then he remembered the horror of the slaughtered villagers in Yazuac A sick angry feeling welled in his stomachThe Urgals were under Galbatorixs orders Why would he commit such an atrocity on his own subjects Because he is evilstated Saphira flatly Glowering Eragon exclaimed This will mean war Once the people of the Empire learn of it they will rebel and support the Varden Murtagh rested his chin in his hand Even if they heard of this outrage few would make it to the Varden With the Urgals under his command the king has enough warriors to close the Empires borders and remain in control no matter how disruptive people are With such a rule of terror he will be able to shape the Empire however he wants And though he is hated people could be galvanized into joining him if they had a common enemy Who would that be asked Eragon confused The elves and the Varden With the right rumors they can be portrayed as the most despicable monsters in Alagaësiafiends who are waiting to seize your land and wealth The Empire could even say that the Urgals have been misunderstood all this time and that they are really friends and allies against such terrible enemies I only wonder what the king promised them in return for their services It wouldnt work said Eragon shaking his head No one could be deceived that easily about Galbatorix and the Urgals Besides why would he want to do that Hes already in power But his authority is challenged by the Varden with whom people sympathize Theres also Surda which has defied him since it seceded from the Empire Galbatorix is strong within the Empire but his arm is weak outside of it As for people seeing through his deceptions theyll believe whatever he wants them to Its happened before Murtagh fell silent and gazed moodily into the distance His words troubled Eragon Saphira touched him with her mindWhere is Galbatorix sending the Urgals What In both Carvahall and Teirm you heard that Urgals were leaving the area and migrating southeast as if to brave the Hadarac Desert If the king truly does control them why is he sending them in that direction Maybe an Urgal army is being gathered for his private use or an Urgal city is being formed Eragon shuddered at the thoughtIm too tired to figure it out Whatever Galbatorixs plans theyll only cause us trouble I just wish that we knew where the Varden are Thats where we should be going but were lost without Dormnad It doesnt matter what we do the Empire will find us Dont give upshe said encouragingly then added drylythough youre probably right ThanksHe looked at Murtagh You risked your life to rescue me I owe you for that I couldnt have escaped on my own It was more than that though There was a bond between them now welded in the brotherhood of battle and tempered by the loyalty Murtagh had shown Im just glad I could help It Murtagh faltered and rubbed his face My main worry now is how were going to travel with so many men searching for us Gileads soldiers will be hunting us tomorrow once they find the horses tracks theyll know you didnt fly away with Saphira Eragon glumly agreed How did you manage to get into the castle Murtagh laughed softly By paying a steep bribe and crawling through a filthy scullery chute But the plan wouldnt have worked without Saphira She he stopped and directed his words at her that is you are the only reason we escaped alive Eragon solemnly put a hand on her scaly neck As she hummed contentedly he gazed at the elfs face captivated Reluctantly he dragged himself upright We should make a bed for her Murtagh got to his feet and stretched out a blanket for the elf When they lifted her onto it the cuff of her sleeve tore on a branch Eragon began to pinch the fabric together then gasped The elfs arm was mottled with a layer of bruises and cuts some were half healed while others were fresh and oozing Eragon shook his head with anger and pulled the sleeve up higher The injuries continued to her shoulder With trembling fingers he unlaced the back of her shirt dreading what might be under it As the leather slipped off Murtagh cursed The elfs back was strong and muscled but it was covered with scabs that made her skin look like dry cracked mud She had been whipped mercilessly and branded with hot irons in the shape of claws Where her skin was still intact it was purple and black from numerous beatings On her left shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink It was the same symbol that had been on the sapphire of Broms ring Eragon silently swore an oath that he would kill whoever was responsible for torturing the elf Can you heal this asked Murtagh II dont know said Eragon He swallowed back sudden queasiness Theres so much Eragonsaid Saphira sharplyThis is an elf She can not be allowed to die Tired or not hungry or not you must save her I will meld my strength with yours but you are the one who must wield the magic Yes you are righthe murmured unable to tear his eyes from the elf Determined he pulled off his gloves and said to Murtagh This is going to take some time Can you get me food Also boil rags for bandages I cant heal all her wounds We cant make a fire without being seen objected Murtagh Youll have to use unwashed cloths and the food will be cold Eragon grimaced but acquiesced As he gently laid a hand on the elfs spine Saphira settled next to him her glittering eyes fixed on the elf He took a deep breath then reached for the magic and started working He spoke the ancient words Waíse heill A burn shimmered under his palm and new unmarked skin flowed over it joining together without a scar He passed over bruises or other wounds that were not lifethreateninghealing them all would consume the energy he needed for more serious injuries As Eragon toiled he marveled that the elf was still alive She had been repeatedly tortured to the edge of death with a precision that chilled him Although he tried to preserve the elfs modesty he could not help but notice that underneath the disfiguring marks her body was exceptionally beautiful He was exhausted and did not dwell upon itthough his ears turned red at times and he fervently hoped that Saphira did not know what he was thinking He labored through dawn pausing only at brief intervals to eat and drink trying to replenish himself from his fast the escape and now healing the elf Saphira remained by his side lending her strength where she could The sun was well into the sky when he finally stood groaning as his cramped muscles stretched His hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty He stumbled to the saddlebags and took a long drink from the wineskin Is it done asked Murtagh Eragon nodded trembling He did not trust himself to speak The camp spun before him he nearly faintedYou did well said Saphira soothingly Will she live I dontdont know he said in a ravaged voice Elves are strong but even they can not endure abuse like this with impunity If I knew more about healing I might be able to revive her but He gestured helplessly His hand was shaking so badly he spilled some of the wine Another swig helped to steady him Wed better start riding again No You must sleep protested Murtagh I can sleep in the saddle But we cant afford to stay here not with the soldiers closing on us Murtagh reluctantly gave in In that case Ill lead Snowfire while you rest They resaddled the horses strapped the elf onto Saphira and departed the camp Eragon ate while he rode trying to replace his depleted energy before he leaned forward against Snowfire and closed his eyes W ATER FROMSAND When they stopped for the evening Eragon felt no better and his temper had worsened Most of the day had been spent on long detours to avoid detection by soldiers with hunting dogs He dismounted Snowfire and asked SaphiraHow is she I think no worse than before She stirred slightly a few times but that was allSaphira crouched low to the ground to let him lift the elf out of the saddle For a moment her soft form pressed against Eragon Then he hurriedly put her down He and Murtagh made a small dinner It was difficult for them to fight off the urge to sleep When they had eaten Murtagh said We cant keep up this pace we arent gaining any ground on the soldiers Another day or two of this and theyll be sure to overtake us What else can we do snapped Eragon If it were just the two of us and you were willing to leave Tornac behind Saphira could fly us out of here But with the elf too Impossible Murtagh looked at him carefully If you want to go your own way I wont stop you I cant expect you and Saphira to stay and risk imprisonment Dont insult me Eragon muttered The only reason Im free is because of you Im not going to abandon you to the Empire Poor thanks that would be Murtagh bowed his head Your words hearten me He paused But they dont solve our problem What can Eragon asked He gestured at the elf I wish she could tell us where the elves are perhaps we could seek sanctuary with them Considering how theyve protected themselves I doubt shed reveal their location Even if she did the others of her kind might not welcome us Why would they want to shelter us anyway The last Riders they had contact with were Galbatorix and the Forsworn I doubt that left them with pleasant memories And I dont even have the dubious honor of being a Rider like you No they would not want me at all They would accept ussaid Saphira confidently as she shifted her wings to a more comfortable position Eragon shrugged Even if they would protect us we cant find them and its impossible to ask the elf until she regains consciousness We must flee but in which directionnorth south east or west Murtagh laced his fingers together and pressed his thumbs against his temples I think the only thing we can do is leave the Empire The few safe places within it are far from here They would be difficult to reach without being caught or followed Theres nothing for us to the north except the forest Du Weldenvardenwhich we might be able to hide in but I dont relish going back past Gilead Only the Empire and the sea lie westward To the south is Surda where you might be able to find someone to direct you to the Varden As for going east He shrugged To the east the Hadarac Desert stands between us and whatever lands exist in that direction The Varden are somewhere across it but without directions it might take us years to find them We would be safe thoughremarked SaphiraAs long as we didnt encounter any Urgals Eragon knitted his brow A headache threatened to drown his thoughts in hot throbs Its too dangerous to go to Surda We would have to traverse most of the Empire avoiding every town and village There are too many people between us and Surda to get there unnoticed Murtagh raised an eyebrow So you want to go across the desert I dont see any other options Besides that way we can leave the Empire before the Razac get here With their flying steeds theyll probably arrive in Gilead in a couple of days so we dont have much time Even if we do reach the desert before they get here said Murtagh they could still overtake us Itll be hard to outdistance them at all Eragon rubbed Saphiras side her scales rough under his fingers Thats assuming they can follow our trail To catch us though theyll have to leave the soldiers behind which is to our advantage If it comes to a fight I think the three of us can defeat them as long as we arent ambushed the way Brom and I were If we reach the other side of the Hadarac safely said Murtagh slowly where will we go Those lands are well outside of the Empire There will be few cities if any And then there is the desert itself What do you know of it Only that its hot dry and full of sand confessed Eragon That about sums it up replied Murtagh Its filled with poisonous and inedible plants venomous snakes scorpions and a blistering sun You saw the great plain on our way to Gilead It was a rhetorical question but Eragon answered anyway Yes and once before Then you are familiar with its immense range It fills the heart of the Empire Now imagine something two or three times its size and youll understand the vastness of the Hadarac Desert That is what youre proposing to cross Eragon tried to envision a piece of land that gigantic but was unable to grasp the distances involved He retrieved the map of Alagaësia from his saddlebags The parchment smelled musty as he unrolled it on the ground He inspected the plains and shook his head in amazement No wonder the Empire ends at the desert Everything on the other side is too far away for Galbatorix to control Murtagh swept his hand over the right side of the parchment All the land beyond the desert which is blank on this map was under one rule when the Riders lived If the king were to raise up new Riders under his command it would allow him to expand the Empire to an unprecedented size But that wasnt the point I was trying to make The Hadarac Desert is so huge and contains so many dangers the chances are slim that we can cross it unscathed It is a desperate path to take Weare desperate said Eragon firmly He studied the map carefully If we rode through the belly of the desert it would take well over a month perhaps even two to cross it But if we angle southeast toward the Beor Mountains we could cut through much faster Then we can either follow the Beor Mountains farther east into the wilderness or go west to Surda If this map is accurate the distance between here and the Beors is roughly equal to what we covered on our way to Gilead But that took us nearly a month Eragon shook his head impatiently Our ride to Gilead was slow on account of my injuries If we press ourselves itll take only a fraction of that time to reach the Beor Mountains Enough You made your point acknowledged Murtagh Before I consent however something must be solved As Im sure you noticed I bought supplies for us and the horses while I was in Gilead But how can we get enough water The roving tribes who live in the Hadarac usually disguise their wells and oases so no one can steal their water And carrying enough for more than a day is impractical Just think about how much Saphira drinks She and the horses consume more water at one time than we do in a week Unless you can make it rain whenever we need I dont see how we can go the direction you propose Eragon rocked back on his heels Making rain was well beyond his power He suspected that not even the strongest Rider could have done it Moving that much air was like trying to lift a mountain He needed a solution that would not drain all of his strengthI wonder if its possible to convert sand into water That would solve our problem but only if it doesnt take too much energy I have an idea he said Let me experiment then Ill give you an answer Eragon strode out of the camp with Saphira following closely What are you going to tryshe asked I dont know he mutteredSaphira could you carry enough water for us She shook her enormous headNo I wouldnt even be able to lift that much weight let alone fly with it Too badHe knelt and picked up a stone with a cavity large enough for a mouthful of water He pressed a clump of dirt into the hollow and studied it thoughtfully Now came the hard part Somehow he had to convert the dirt into waterBut what words should I use He puzzled over it for a moment then picked two he hoped would work The icy magic rushed through him as he breached the familiar barrier in his mind and commanded Deloi moi Immediately the dirt began to absorb his strength at a prodigious rate Eragons mind flashed back to Broms warning that certain tasks could consume all of his power and take his life Panic blossomed in his chest He tried to release the magic but could not It was linked to him until the task was complete or he was dead All he could do was remain motionless growing weaker every moment Just as he became convinced that he would die kneeling there the dirt shimmered and morphed into a thimbleful of water Relieved Eragon sat back breathing hard His heart pounded painfully and hunger gnawed at his innards What happenedasked Saphira Eragon shook his head still in shock from the drain on his bodys reserves He was glad that he had not tried to transmute anything largerThis this wont work he saidI dont even have the strength to give myself a drink You should have been more carefulshe chidedMagic can yield unexpected results when the ancient words are combined in new ways He glared at herI know that but this was the only way I could test my idea I wasnt going to wait until we were in the desert He reminded himself that she was only trying to helpHow did you turn Broms grave into diamond without killing yourself I can barely handle a bit of dirt much less all that sandstone I dont know how I did itshe stated calmlyIt just happened Could you do it again but this time make water Eragonshe said looking him squarely in the faceIve no more control over my abilities than a spider does Things like that occur whether I will them or not Brom told you that unusual events happen around dragons He spoke truly He gave no explanation for it nor do I have one Sometimes I can work changes just by feel almost without thought The rest of the timelike right nowIm as powerless as Snowfire Youre never powerlesshe said softly putting a hand on her neck For a long period they were both quiet Eragon remembered the grave he had made and how Brom lay within it He could still see the sandstone flowing over the old mans face At least we gave him a decent burial he whispered He idly swirled a finger in the dirt making twisting ridges Two of the ridges formed a miniature valley so he added mountains around it With his fingernail he scratched a river down the valley then deepened it because it seemed too shallow He added a few more details until he found himself staring at a passable reproduction of Palancar Valley Homesickness welled up within him and he obliterated the valley with a swipe of his hand I dont want to talk about ithe muttered angrily staving off Saphiras questions He crossed his arms and glared at the ground Almost against his will his eyes flicked back to where he had gouged the earth He straightened surprised Though the ground was dry the furrow he had made was lined with moisture Curious he scraped away more dirt and found a damp layer a few inches under the surface Look at this he said excitedly Saphira lowered her nose to his discoveryHow does this help us Water in the desert is sure to be buried so deeply we would have to dig for weeks to find it Yessaid Eragon delightedlybut as long as its there I can get it Watch He deepened the hole then mentally accessed the magic Instead of changing the dirt into water he simply summoned forth the moisture that was already in the earth With a faint trickle water rushed into the hole He smiled and sipped from it The liquid was cool and pure perfect for drinkingSee We can get all we need Saphira sniffed the poolHere yes But in the desert There may not be enough water in the ground for you to bring to the surface It will workEragon assured herAll Im doing is lifting the water an easy enough task As long as its done slowly my strength will hold Even if I have to draw the water from fifty paces down it wont be a problem Especially if you help me Saphira looked at him dubiouslyAre you sure Think carefully upon your answer for it will mean our lives if you are wrong Eragon hesitated then said firmlyIm sure Then go tell Murtagh I will keep watch while you sleep But youve stayed up all night like ushe objectedYou should rest Ill be fineIm stronger than you knowshe said gently Her scales rustled as she curled up with a watchful eye turned northward toward their pursuers Eragon hugged her and she hummed deeply sides vibratingGo He lingered then reluctantly returned to Murtagh who asked Well Is the desert open to us It is acknowledged Eragon He flopped onto his blankets and explained what he had learned When he finished Eragon turned to the elf Her face was the last thing he saw before falling asleep T HERAMRRIVER They forced themselves to rise early in the gray predawn hours Eragon shivered in the cool air How are we going to transport the elf She cant ride on Saphiras back much longer without getting sores from her scales Saphira cant carry her in her clawsit tires her and makes landing dangerous A sledge wont work it would get battered to pieces while we ride and I dont want the horses slowed by the weight of another person Murtagh considered the matter as he saddled Tornac If you were to ride Saphira we could lash the elf onto Snowfire but wed have the same problem with sores I have a solutionsaid Saphira unexpectedlyWhy dont you tie the elf to my belly Ill still be able to move freely and she will be safer than anywhere else The only danger will be if soldiers shoot arrows at me but I can easily fly above those None of them could come up with a better idea so they quickly adopted hers Eragon folded one of his blankets in half lengthwise secured it around the elfs petite form then took her to Saphira Blankets and spare clothes were sacrificed to form ropes long enough to encircle Saphiras girth With those ropes the elf was tied backfirst against Saphiras belly her head between Saphiras front legs Eragon looked critically at their handiwork Im afraid your scales may rub through the ropes Well have to check them occasionally for fraying commented Murtagh Shall we go nowSaphira asked and Eragon repeated the question Murtaghs eyes sparked dangerously a tight smile lifting his lips He glanced back the way they had come where smoke from soldiers camps was clearly visible and said I always did like races And now we are in one for our lives Murtagh swung into Tornacs saddle and trotted out of the camp Eragon followed close behind on Snowfire Saphira jumped into the air with the elf She flew low to the ground to avoid being seen by the soldiers In this fashion the three of them made their way southeast toward the distant Hadarac Desert Eragon kept a quick eye out for pursuers as he rode His mind repeatedly wandered back to the elfAn elf He had actually seen one and she was with them He wondered what Roran would think of that It struck him that if he ever returned to Carvahall he would have a hard time convincing anyone that his adventures had actually occurred For the rest of the day Eragon and Murtagh sped through the land ignoring discomfort and fatigue They drove the horses as hard as they could without killing them Sometimes they dismounted and ran on foot to give Tornac and Snowfire a rest Only twice did they stopboth times to let the horses eat and drink Though the soldiers of Gilead were far behind now Eragon and Murtagh found themselves having to avoid new soldiers every time they passed a town or village Somehow the alarm had been sent ahead of them Twice they were nearly ambushed along the trail escaping only because Saphira happened to smell the men ahead of them After the second incident they avoided the trail entirely Dusk softened the countryside as evening drew a black cloak across the sky Through the night they traveled relentlessly pacing out the miles In the deepest hours of night the ground rose beneath them to form low cactusdotted hills Murtagh pointed forward Theres a town Bullridge some leagues ahead that we must bypass Theyre sure to have soldiers watching for us We should try to slip past them now while its dark After three hours they saw the strawyellow lanterns of Bullridge A web of soldiers patrolled between watch fires scattered around the town Eragon and Murtagh muffled their sword sheaths and carefully dismounted They led the horses in a wide detour around Bullridge listening attentively to avoid stumbling on an encampment With the town behind them Eragon relaxed slightly Daybreak finally flooded the sky with a delicate blush and warmed the chilly night air They halted on the crest of a hill to observe their surroundings The Ramr River was to their left but it was also five miles to their right The river continued south for several leagues then doubled back on itself in a narrow loop before curving west They had covered over sixteen leagues in one day Eragon leaned against Snowfires neck happy with the distance they had gone Lets find a gully or hollow where we can sleep undisturbed They stopped at a small stand of juniper trees and laid their blankets beneath them Saphira waited patiently as they untied the elf from her belly Ill take the first watch and wake you at midmorning said Murtagh setting his bare sword across his knees Eragon mumbled his assent and pulled the blankets over his shoulders Nightfall found them worn and drowsy but determined to continue As they prepared to leave Saphira observed to EragonThis is the third night since we rescued you from Gilead and the elf still hasnt woken Im worried And she continuedshe has neither drunk nor eaten in that time I know little of elves but she is slender and I doubt she can survive much longer without nourishment Whats wrong asked Murtagh over Tornacs back The elf said Eragon looking down at her Saphira is troubled that she hasnt woken or eaten it disturbs me too I healed her wounds at least on the surface but it doesnt seem to have done her any good Maybe the Shade tampered with her mind suggested Murtagh Then we have to help her Murtagh knelt by the elf He examined her intently then shook his head and stood As far as I can tell shes only sleeping It seems as if I could wake her with a word or a touch yet she slumbers on Her coma might be something elves selfinduce to escape the pain of injury but if so why doesnt she end it Theres no danger to her now But does she know that asked Eragon quietly Murtagh put a hand on his shoulder This must wait We have to leave now or risk losing our hardwon lead You can tend to her later when we stop One thing first said Eragon He soaked a rag then squeezed the cloth so water dripped between the elfs sculpted lips He did that several times and dabbed above her straight angled eyebrows feeling oddly protective They headed through the hills avoiding the tops for fear of being spotted by sentries Saphira stayed with them on the ground for the same reason Despite her bulk she was stealthy only her tail could be heard scraping over the ground like a thick blue snake Eventually the sky brightened in the east The morning star Aiedail appeared as they reached the edge of a steep bank covered with mounds of brush Water roared below as it tore over boulders and sluiced through branches The Ramr said Eragon over the noise Murtagh nodded Yes We have to find a place to ford safely That isnt necessarysaid SaphiraI can carry you across no matter how wide the river is Eragon looked up at her bluegray formWhat about the horses We cant leave them behind Theyre too heavy for you to lift As long as youre not on them and they dont struggle too much Im sure that I can carry them If I can dodge arrows with three people on my back I can certainly fly a horse in a straight line over a river I believe you but lets not attempt it unless we have to Its too dangerous She clambered down the embankmentWe cant afford to squander time here Eragon followed her leading Snowfire The bank came to an abrupt end at the Ramr where the river ran dark and swift White mist wafted up from the water like blood steaming in winter It was impossible to see the far side Murtagh tossed a branch into the torrent and watched it race away bobbing on the rough water How deep do you think it is asked Eragon I cant tell said Murtagh worry coloring his voice Can you see how far across it is with magic I dont think so not without lighting up this place like a beacon With a gust of air Saphira took off and soared over the Ramr After a short time she saidIm on the other bank The river is over a halfmile wide You couldnt have chosen a worse place to cross the Ramr bends at this point and is at its widest A halfmile exclaimed Eragon He told Murtagh about Saphiras offer to fly them Id rather not try it for the horses sake Tornac isnt as accustomed to Saphira as Snowfire He might panic and injure them both Ask Saphira to look for shallows where we can swim over safely If there arent any within a mile in either direction then I suppose she can ferry us At Eragons request Saphira agreed to search for a ford While she explored they hunkered next to the horses and ate dry bread It was not long before Saphira returned her velvet wings whispering in the early dawn skyThe water is both deep and strong upstream as well as downstream Once he was told Murtagh said Id better go over first so I can watch the horses He scrambled onto Saphiras saddle Be careful with Tornac Ive had him for many years I dont want anything to happen to him Then Saphira took off When she returned the unconscious elf had been untied from her belly Eragon led Tornac to Saphira ignoring the horses low whinnies Saphira reared back on her haunches to grasp the horse around the belly with her forelegs Eragon eyed her formidable claws and said Wait He repositioned Tornacs saddle blanket strapping it to the horses belly so it protected his soft underside then gestured for Saphira to proceed Tornac snorted in fright and tried to bolt when Saphiras forelegs clamped around his sides but she held him tightly The horse rolled his eyes wildly the whites rimming his dilated pupils Eragon tried to gentle Tornac with his mind but the horses panic resisted his touch Before Tornac could try to escape again Saphira jumped skyward her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws gouged the rocks underneath Her wings strained furiously struggling to lift the enormous load For a moment it seemed she would fall back to the ground Then with a lunge she shot into the air Tornac screamed in terror kicking and tossing It was a terrible sound like screeching metal Eragon swore wondering if anyone was close enough to hearYoud better hurry Saphira He listened for soldiers as he waited scanning the inky landscape for the telltale flash of torches It soon met his eye in a line of horsemen sliding down a bluff almost a league away As Saphira landed Eragon brought Snowfire to herMurtaghs silly animal is in hysterics He had to tie Tornac down to prevent him from running away She gripped Snowfire and carried him off ignoring the horses trumpeted protestations Eragon watched her go feeling lonely in the night The horsemen were only a mile away Finally Saphira came for him and they were soon on firm ground once more with the Ramr to their backs Once the horses were calmed and the saddles readjusted they resumed their flight toward the Beor Mountains The air filled with the calls of birds waking to a new day Eragon dozed even when walking He was barely aware that Murtagh was just as drowsy There were times when neither of them guided the horses and it was only Saphiras vigilance that kept them on course Eventually the ground became soft and gave way under their feet forcing them to halt The sun was high overhead The Ramr River was no more than a fuzzy line behind them They had reached the Hadarac Desert T HEHADARACDESERT Avast expanse of dunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean Bursts of wind twirled the reddish gold sand into the air Scraggly trees grew on scattered patches of solid groundground any farmer would have declared unfit for crops Rising in the distance was a line of purple crags The imposing desolation was barren of any animals except for a bird gliding on the zephyrs Youre sure well find food for the horses out there queried Eragon slurring his words The hot dry air stung his throat See those asked Murtagh indicating the crags Grass grows around them Its short and tough but the horses will find it sufficient I hope youre right said Eragon squinting at the sun Before we continue lets rest My mind is slow as a snail and I can barely move my legs They untied the elf from Saphira ate then lay in the shadow of a dune for a nap As Eragon settled into the sand Saphira coiled up next to him and spread her wings over themThis is a wondrous place she saidI could spend years here and not notice the passing time Eragon closed his eyesIt would be a nice place to fly he agreed drowsily Not only that I feel as though I was made for this desert It has the space I need mountains where I could roost and camouflaged prey that I could spend days hunting And the warmth Cold does not disturb me but this heat makes me feel alive and full of energyShe craned her head toward the sky stretching happily You like it that muchmumbled Eragon Yes Then when this is all done perhaps we can return He drifted into slumber even as he spoke Saphira was pleased and hummed gently while he and Murtagh rested It was the morning of the fourth day since leaving Gilead They had already covered thirtyfive leagues They slept just long enough to clear their minds and rest the horses No soldiers could be seen to the rear but that did not lull them into slowing their pace They knew that the Empire would keep searching until they were far beyond the kings reach Eragon said Couriers must have carried news of my escape to Galbatorix He would have alerted the Razac Theyre sure to be on our trail by now Itll take them a while to catch us even by flying but we should be ready for them at all times And this time they will find I am not so easily bound with chainssaid Saphira Murtagh scratched his chin I hope they wont be able to follow us past Bullridge The Ramr was an effective way to lose pursuers theres a good chance our tracks wont be found again Something to hope for indeed said Eragon as he checked the elf Her condition was unchanged she still did not react to his ministrations I place no faith in luck right now though The Razac could be on our trail even as we speak At sunset they arrived at the crags they had viewed from afar that morning The imposing stone bluffs towered over them casting thin shadows The surrounding area was free of dunes for a half mile Heat assailed Eragon like a physical blow as he dismounted Snowfire onto the baked cracked ground The back of his neck and his face were sunburned his skin was hot and feverish After picketing the horses where they could nibble the sparse grass Murtagh started a small fire How far do you think we went Eragon asked releasing the elf from Saphira I dont know snapped Murtagh His skin was red his eyes bloodshot He picked up a pot and muttered a curse We dont have enough water And the horses have to drink Eragon was just as irritated by the heat and dryness but he held his temper in check Bring the horses Saphira dug a hole for him with her claws then he closed his eyes releasing the spell Though the ground was parched there was enough moisture for the plants to live on and enough for him to fill the hole several times over Murtagh refilled the waterskins as water pooled in the hole then stood aside and let the horses drink The thirsty animals quaffed gallons Eragon was forced to draw the liquid from ever deeper in the earth to satisfy their desire It taxed his strength to the limit When the horses were finally sated he said to SaphiraIf you need a drink take it now Her head snaked around him and she took two long draughts but no more Before letting the water flow back into the ground Eragon gulped down as much as he could then watched the last drops melt back into the dirt Holding the water on the surface was harder than he had expectedBut at least its within my abilities he reflected remembering with some amusement how he had once struggled to lift even a pebble It was freezing when they rose the next day The sand had a pink hue in the morning light and the sky was hazy concealing the horizon Murtaghs mood had not improved with sleep and Eragon found his own rapidly deteriorating During breakfast he asked Do you think itll be long before we leave the desert Murtagh glowered Were only crossing a small section of it so I cant imagine that itll take us more than two or three days But look how far weve already come All right maybe it wont All I care about right now is getting out of the Hadarac as quickly as possible What were doing is hard enough without having to pick sand from our eyes every few minutes They finished eating then Eragon went to the elf She lay as one deada corpse except for her measured breathing Where lies your injury whispered Eragon brushing a strand of hair from her face How can you sleep like this and yet live The image of her alert and poised in the prison cell was still vivid in his mind Troubled he prepared the elf for travel then saddled and mounted Snowfire As they left the camp a line of dark smudges became visible on the horizon indistinct in the hazy air Murtagh thought they were distant hills Eragon was not convinced but he could make out no details The elfs plight filled his thoughts He was sure that something had to be done to help her or she would die though he knew not what that might be Saphira was just as concerned They talked about it for hours but neither of them knew enough about healing to solve the problem confronting them At midday they stopped for a brief rest When they resumed their journey Eragon noticed that the haze had thinned since morning and the distant smudges had gained definition No longer were they indistinct purpleblue lumps but rather broad forestcovered mounds with clear outlines The air above them was pale white bleached of its usual hueall color seemed to have been leached out of a horizontal band of sky that lay on top of the hills and extended to the horizons edges He stared puzzled but the more he tried to make sense of it the more confused he became He blinked and shook his head thinking that it must be some illusion of the desert air Yet when he opened his eyes the annoying incongruity was still there Indeed the whiteness blanketed half the sky before them Sure that something was terribly wrong he started to point this out to Murtagh and Saphira when he suddenly understood what he was seeing What they had taken to be hills were actually the bases of gigantic mountains scores of miles wide Except for the dense forest along their lower regions the mountains were entirely covered with snow and ice It was this that had deceived Eragon into thinking the sky white He craned back his neck searching for the peaks but they were not visible The mountains stretched up into the sky until they faded from sight Narrow jagged valleys with ridges that nearly touched split the mountains like deep gorges It was like a ragged toothy wall linking Alagaësia with the heavens Theres no end to themhe thought awestruck Stories that mentioned the Beor Mountains always noted their size but he had discounted such reports as fanciful embellishments Now however he was forced to acknowledge their authenticity Sensing his wonder and surprise Saphira followed his gaze with her own Within a few seconds she recognized the mountains for what they wereI feel like a hatchling again Compared to them even I feel small We must be near the edge of the desertsaid EragonIts only taken two days and we can already see the far side and beyond Saphira spiraled above the dunesYes but considering the size of those peaks they could still be fifty leagues from here Its hard to gauge distances against something so immense Wouldnt they be a perfect hiding place for the elves or the Varden You could hide more than the elves and Vardenhe statedEntire nations could exist in secret there hidden from the Empire Imagine living with those behemoths looming over youHe guided Snowfire to Murtagh and pointed grinning What grunted Murtagh scanning the land Look closely urged Eragon Murtagh peered closely at the horizon He shrugged What I dont The words died in his mouth and gave way to slackjawed wonder Murtagh shook his head muttering Thats impossible He squinted so hard that the corners of his eyes crinkled He shook his head again I knew the Beor Mountains were large but not that monstrous size Lets hope the animals that live there arent in proportion to the mountains said Eragon lightly Murtagh smiled It will be good to find some shade and spend a few weeks in leisure Ive had enough of this forced march Im tired too admitted Eragon but I dont want to stop until the elf is cured or she dies I dont see how continuing to travel will help her said Murtagh gravely A bed will do her more good than hanging underneath Saphira all day Eragon shrugged Maybe When we reach the mountains I could take her to Surdaits not that far There must be a healer there who can help her we certainly cant Murtagh shaded his eyes with his hand and stared at the mountains We can talk about it later For now our goal is to reach the Beors There at least the Razac will have trouble finding us and we will be safe from the Empire As the day wore on the Beor Mountains seemed to get no closer though the landscape changed dramatically The sand slowly transformed from loose grains of reddish hue to hardpacked duskycream dirt In place of dunes were ragged patches of plants and deep furrows in the ground where flooding had occurred A cool breeze wafted through the air bringing welcome refreshment The horses sensed the change of climate and hurried forward eagerly When evening subdued the sun the mountains foothills were a mere league away Herds of gazelles bounded through lush fields of waving grass Eragon caught Saphira eyeing them hungrily They camped by a stream relieved to be out of the punishing Hadarac Desert AP ATHREVEALED Fatigued and haggard but with triumphant smiles they sat around the fire congratulating each other Saphira crowed jubilantly which startled the horses Eragon stared at the flames He was proud that they had covered roughly sixty leagues in five days It was an impressive feat even for a rider able to change mounts regularly I am outside of the EmpireIt was a strange thought He had been born in the Empire lived his entire life under Galbatorixs rule lost his closest friends and family to the kings servants and had nearly died several times within his domain Now Eragon was free No more would he and Saphira have to dodge soldiers avoid towns or hide who they were It was a bittersweet realization for the cost had been the loss of his entire world He looked at the stars in the gloaming sky And though the thought of building a home in the safety of isolation appealed to him he had witnessed too many wrongs committed in Galbatorixs name from murder to slavery to turn his back on the Empire No longer was it just vengeancefor Broms death as well as Garrowsthat drove him As a Rider it was his duty to assist those without strength to resist Galbatorixs oppression With a sigh he abandoned his deliberation and observed the elf stretched out by Saphira The fires orange light gave her face a warm cast Smooth shadows flickered under her cheekbones As he stared an idea slowly came to him He could hear the thoughts of people and animalsand communicate with them in that manner if he chose tobut it was something he had done infrequently except with Saphira He always remembered Broms admonishment not to violate someones mind unless absolutely necessary Save for the one time he had tried to probe Murtaghs consciousness he had refrained from doing so Now however he wondered if it were possible to contact the elf in her comatose stateI might be able to learn from her memories why she remains like this But if she recovers would she forgive me for such an intrusion Whether she does or not I must try Shes been in this condition for almost a week Without speaking of his intentions to Murtagh or Saphira he knelt by the elf and placed his palm on her brow Eragon closed his eyes and extended a tendril of thought like a probing finger toward the elfs mind He found it without difficulty It was not fuzzy and filled with pain as he had anticipated but lucid and clear like a note from a crystal bell Suddenly an icy dagger drove into his mind Pain exploded behind his eyes with splashes of color He recoiled from the attack but found himself held in an iron grip unable to retreat Eragon fought as hard as he could and used every defense he could think of The dagger stabbed into his mind again He frantically threw his own barriers before it blunting the attack The pain was less excruciating than the first time but it jarred his concentration The elf took the opportunity to ruthlessly crush his defenses A stifling blanket pressed down on Eragon from all directions smothering his thoughts The overpowering force slowly contracted squeezing the life out of him bit by bit though he held on unwilling to give up The elf tightened her relentless grip even more so as to extinguish him like a snuffed candle He desperately cried in the ancient language Eka aí fricai un Shurtugal I am a Rider and friend The deadly embrace did not loosen its hold but its constriction halted and surprise emanated from her Suspicion followed a second later but he knew she would believe him he could not have lied in the ancient language However while he had said he was a friend that did not mean he meant her no harm For all she knew Eragon believed himself to be her friend making the statement true for him thoughshe might not consider him oneThe ancient language does have its limitations thought Eragon hoping that the elf would be curious enough to risk freeing him She was The pressure lifted and the barriers around her mind hesitantly lowered The elf warily let their thoughts touch like two wild animals meeting for the first time A cold shiver ran down Eragons side Her mind was alien It felt vast and powerful weighted with memories of uncounted years Dark thoughts loomed out of sight and touch artifacts of her race that made him cringe when they brushed his consciousness Yet through all the sensations shimmered a melody of wild haunting beauty that embodied her identity What is your nameshe asked speaking in the ancient language Her voice was weary and filled with quiet despair Eragon And yoursHer consciousness lured him closer inviting him to submerge himself in the lyric strains of her blood He resisted the summons with difficulty though his heart ached to accept it For the first time he understood the fey attraction of elves They were creatures of magic unbound by the mortal laws of the landas different from humans as dragons were from animals Arya Why have you contacted me in this manner Am I still a captive of theEmpire No you are freesaid Eragon Though he knew only scattered words in the ancient language he managed to conveyI was imprisoned in Gilead like you but I escaped and rescued you In the five days since then weve crossed the edge of the Hadarac Desert and are now camped by the Beor Mountains Youve not stirred nor said a word in all that time Ah so it was GileadShe pausedI know that my wounds were healed At the time I did not understand whypreparation for some new torture I was certain Now I realize it was you Softly she addedEven so I have not risen and you are puzzled Yes During my captivity a rare poison the Skilna Bragh was given to me along with the drug to suppress my power Every morning the antidote for the previous days poison was administered to me by force if I refused to take it Without it I will die within a few hours That is why I lie in this tranceit slows the Skilna Braghs progress though does not stop it I contemplated waking for the purpose of ending my life and denyingGalbatorix but I refrained from doing so out of hope that you might be an ally Her voice dwindled off weakly How long can you remain like thisasked Eragon For weeks but Im afraid I havent that much time This dormancy can not restrain death forever I can feel it in my veins even now Unless I receive the antidote I will succumb to the poison in three or four days Where can the antidote be found It exists in only two places outside of the Empire with my own people and with the Varden However my home is beyond the reach of dragonback What about the Varden We would have taken you straight to them but we dont know where they are I will tell youif you give me your word that you will never reveal their location to Galbatorix or to anyone who serves him In addition you must swear that you have not deceived me in some manner and that you intend no harm to the elves dwarves Varden or the race of dragons What Arya asked for would have been simple enoughif they had not been conversing in the ancient language Eragon knew she wanted oaths more binding than life itself Once made they could never be broken That weighed heavily on him as he gravely pledged his word in agreement It is understood A series of vertigoinducing images suddenly flashed through his mind He found himself riding along the Beor Mountain range traveling eastward many leagues Eragon did his best to remember the route as craggy mountains and hills flashed past He was heading south now still following the mountains Then everything wheeled abruptly and he entered a narrow winding valley It snaked through the mountains to the base of a frothy waterfall that pounded into a deep lake The images stoppedIt is far said Aryabut do not let the distance dissuade you When you arrive at the lake Kósthamérna at the end of the Beartooth River take a rock bang on the cliff next to the waterfall and cry Aí varden abr du Shurtugals gata vantaYou will be admitted You will be challenged but do not falter no matter how perilous it seems What should they give you for the poisonhe asked Her voice quavered but then she regained her strengthTell themto give me Túnivors Nectar You must leave me now I have expended too much energy already Do not talk with me again unless there is no hope of reaching the Varden If that is the case there is information I must impart to you so the Varden will survive Farewell Eragon rider of dragons my life is in your hands Arya withdrew from their contact The unearthly strains that had echoed across their link were gone Eragon took a shuddering breath and forced his eyes open Murtagh and Saphira stood on either side of him watching with concern Are you all right asked Murtagh Youve been kneeling here for almost fifteen minutes I have asked Eragon blinking Yes and grimacing like a pained gargoylecommented Saphira dryly Eragon stood wincing as his cramped knees stretched I talked with Arya Murtagh frowned quizzically as if to inquire if he had gone mad Eragon explained The elfthats her name And what is it that ails herasked Saphira impatiently Eragon swiftly told them of his entire discussion How far away are the Varden asked Murtagh Im not exactly sure confessed Eragon From what she showed me I think its even farther than from here to Gilead And were supposed to cover that in three or four days demanded Murtagh angrily It took us fivelong days to get here What do you want to do kill the horses Theyre exhausted as it is But if we do nothing shell die If its too much for the horses Saphira can fly ahead with Arya and me at least we would get to the Varden in time You could catch up with us in a few days Murtagh grunted and crossed his arms Of course Murtagh the pack animal Murtagh the horse leader I should have remembered thats all Im good for nowadays Oh and lets not forget every soldier in the Empire is searching for me now because you couldnt defend yourself and I had to go andsave you Yes I suppose Ill just follow your instructions and bring up the horses in the rear like a good servant Eragon was bewildered by the sudden venom in Murtaghs voice Whats wrong with you Im grateful for what you did Theres no reason to be angry with me I didnt ask you to accompany me or to rescue me from Gilead You chose that I havent forced you to do anything Oh not openly no What else could I do but help you with the Razac And then later at Gilead how could I have left with a clear conscience The problem with you said Murtagh poking Eragon in the chest is that youre so totally helpless you force everyone to take care of you The words stung Eragons pride he recognized a grain of truth in them Dont touch me he growled Murtagh laughed a harsh note in his voice Or what youll punch me You couldnt hit a brick wall He went to shove Eragon again but Eragon grabbed his arm and struck him in the stomach I said dont touch me Murtagh doubled over swearing Then he yelled and launched himself at Eragon They fell in a tangle of arms and legs pounding on each other Eragon kicked at Murtaghs right hip missed and grazed the fire Sparks and burning embers scattered through the air They scrabbled across the ground trying to get leverage Eragon managed to get his feet under Murtaghs chest and kicked mightily Murtagh flew upside down over Eragons head landing flat on his back with a solid thump Murtaghs breath whooshed out He rolled stiffly to his feet then wheeled to face Eragon panting heavily They charged each other once more Saphiras tail slapped between them accompanied by a deafening roar Eragon ignored her and tried to jump over her tail but a taloned paw caught him in midair and flung him back to the ground Enough He futilely tried to push Saphiras muscled leg off his chest and saw that Murtagh was likewise pinned Saphira roared again snapping her jaws She swung her head over Eragon and glared at himYou of all people should know better Fighting like starving dogs over a scrap of meat What would Brom say Eragon felt his cheeks burn and averted his eyes He knew what Brom would have said Saphira held them on the ground letting them simmer then said to Eragon pointedlyNow if you dont want to spend the night under my foot you will politely ask Murtagh what is troubling him She snaked her head over to Murtagh and stared down at him with an impassive blue eyeAnd tell him that I wont stand for insults from either of you Wont you let us upcomplained Eragon No Eragon reluctantly turned his head toward Murtagh tasting blood in the side of his mouth Murtagh avoided his eyes and looked up at the sky Well is she going to get off us No not unless we talk She wants me to ask you whats really the problem said Eragon embarrassed Saphira growled an affirmative and continued to stare at Murtagh It was impossible for him to escape her piercing glare Finally he shrugged muttering something under his breath Saphiras claws tightened on his chest and her tail whistled through the air Murtagh shot her an angry glance then grudgingly said louder I told you before I dont want to go to the Varden Eragon frowned Was that all that was the matter Dont want to or cant Murtagh tried to shove Saphiras leg off him then gave up with a curse Dont want to Theyll expect things from me that I cant deliver Did you steal something from them I wish it were that simple Eragon rolled his eyes exasperated Well what is it then Did you kill someone important or bed the wrong woman No I was born said Murtagh cryptically He pushed at Saphira again This time she released them both They got to their feet under her watchful eye and brushed dirt from their backs Youre avoiding the question Eragon said dabbing his split lip So what spat Murtagh as he stomped to the edge of the camp After a minute he sighed It doesnt matter why Im in this predicament but I can tell you that the Varden wouldnt welcome me even if I came bearing the kings head Oh they might greet me nicely enough and let me into their councils but trust me Never And if I were to arrive under less fortuitous circumstances like the present ones theyd likely clap me in irons Wont you tell me what this is about asked Eragon Ive done things Im not proud of too so its not as if Im going to pass judgment Murtagh shook his head slowly eyes glistening It isnt like that I haventdone anything to deserve this treatment though it would have been easier to atone for if I had No my only wrongdoing is existing in the first place He stopped and took a shaky breath You see my father A sharp hiss from Saphira cut him off abruptlyLook They followed her gaze westward Murtaghs face paled Demons above and below A league or so away parallel to the mountain range was a column of figures marching east The line of troops hundreds strong stretched for nearly a mile Dust billowed from their heels Their weapons glinted in the dying light A standardbearer rode before them in a black chariot holding aloft a crimson banner Its the Empire said Eragon tiredly Theyve found us somehow Saphira poked her head over his shoulder and gazed at the column Yes but those are Urgals not men said Murtagh How can you tell Murtagh pointed at the standard That flag bears the personal symbol of an Urgal chieftain Hes a ruthless brute given to violent fits and insanity Youve met him Murtaghs eyes tightened Once briefly I still have scars from that encounter These Urgals might not have been sent here for us but Im sure weve been seen by now and that they will follow us Their chieftain isnt the sort to let a dragon escape his grasp especially if hes heard about Gilead Eragon hurried to the fire and covered it with dirt We have to flee You dont want to go to the Varden but I have to take Arya to them before she dies Heres a compromise come with me until I reach the lake Kósthamérna then go your own way Murtagh hesitated Eragon added quickly If you leave now in sight of the column Urgals will follow you And then where will you be facing them alone Very well said Murtagh tossing his saddlebags over Tornacs flanks but when we near the Varden Iwill leave Eragon burned to question Murtagh further but not with Urgals so near He gathered his belongings and saddled Snowfire Saphira fanned her wings took off in a rush and circled above She kept guard over Murtagh and Eragon as they left camp What direction shall I flyshe asked East along the Beors Stilling her wings Saphira rose on an updraft and teetered on the pillar of warm air hovering in the sky over the horses I wonder why the Urgals are here Maybe they were sent to attack the Varden Then we should try to warn themhe said guiding Snowfire past halfvisible obstacles As the night deepened the Urgals faded into the gloom behind them AC LASH OFWILLS When morning came Eragons cheek was raw from chafing against Snowfires neck and he was sore from his fight with Murtagh They had alternated sleeping in their saddles throughout the night It had allowed them to outdistance the Urgal troops but neither of them knew if the lead could be retained The horses were exhausted to the point of stopping yet they still maintained a relentless pace Whether it would be enough to escape depended on how rested the monsters were and if Eragon and Murtaghs horses survived The Beor Mountains cast great shadows over the land stealing the suns warmth To the north was the Hadarac Desert a thin white band as bright as noonday snow I must eatsaid SaphiraDays have passed since I last hunted Hunger claws my belly If I start now I might be able to catch enough of those bounding deer for a few mouthfuls Eragon smiled at her exaggerationGo if you must but leave Arya here I will be swiftHe untied the elf from her belly and transferred her to Snowfires saddle Saphira soared away disappearing in the direction of the mountains Eragon ran beside the horses close enough to Snowfire to keep Arya from falling Neither he nor Murtagh intruded on the silence Yesterdays fight no longer seemed as important because of the Urgals but the bruises remained Saphira made her kills within the hour and notified Eragon of her success Eragon was pleased that she would soon return Her absence made him nervous They stopped at a pond to let the horses drink Eragon idly plucked a stalk of grass twirling it while he stared at the elf He was startled from his reverie by the steely rasp of a sword being unsheathed He instinctively grasped Zarroc and spun around in search of the enemy There was only Murtagh his long sword held ready He pointed at a hill ahead of them where a tall browncloaked man sat on a sorrel horse mace in hand Behind him was a group of twenty horsemen No one moved Could they be Varden asked Murtagh Eragon surreptitiously strung his bow According to Arya theyre still scores of leagues away This might be one of their patrols or raiding groups Assuming theyre not bandits Murtagh swung onto Tornac and readied his own bow Should we try to outrun them asked Eragon draping a blanket over Arya The horsemen must have seen her but he hoped to conceal the fact that she was an elf It wouldnt do any good said Murtagh shaking his head Tornac and Snowfire are fine warhorses but theyre tired and they arent sprinters Look at the horses those men have theyre meant for running They would catch us before we had gone a halfmile Besides they may have something important to say Youd better tell Saphira to hurry back Eragon was already doing that He explained the situation then warnedDont show yourself unless its necessary Were not in the Empire but I still dont want anyone to know about you Never mind thatshe repliedRemember magic can protect you where speed and luck fail He felt her take off and race toward them skimming close to the ground The band of men watched them from the hill Eragon nervously gripped Zarroc The wirewrapped hilt was secure under his glove He said in a low voice If they threaten us I can frighten them away with magic If that doesnt work theres Saphira I wonder how theyd react to a Rider So many stories have been told about their powers It might be enough to avoid a fight Dont count on it said Murtagh flatly If theres a fight well just have to kill enough of them to convince them were not worth the effort His face was controlled and unemotional The man on the sorrel horse signaled with his mace sending the horsemen cantering toward them The men shook javelins over their heads whooping loudly as they neared Battered sheaths hung from their sides Their weapons were rusty and stained Four of them trained arrows on Eragon and Murtagh Their leader swirled the mace in the air and his men responded with yells as they wildly encircled Eragon and Murtagh Eragons lips twitched He almost loosed a blast of magic into their midst then restrained himselfWe dont know what they want yet he reminded himself containing his growing apprehension The moment Eragon and Murtagh were thoroughly surrounded the leader reined in his horse then crossed his arms and examined them critically He raised his eyebrows Well these are better than the usual dregs we find At least we got healthy ones this time And we didnt even have to shoot them Grieg will be pleased The men chuckled At his words a sinking sensation filled Eragons gut A suspicion stirred in his mindSaphira Now as for you two said the leader speaking to Eragon and Murtagh if you would be so good as to drop your weapons youll avoid being turned into living quivers by my men The archers grinned suggestively the men laughed again Murtaghs only movement was to shift his sword Who are you and what do you want We are free men traveling through this land You have no right to stop us Oh I have every right said the man contemptuously And as for my nameslaves do not address their masters in that manner unless they want to be beaten Eragon cursed to himselfSlavers He remembered vividly the people he had seen at auction in DrasLeona Rage boiled within him He glared at the men around him with new hatred and disgust The lines deepened on the leaders face Throw down your swords and surrender The slavers tensed staring at them with cold eyes as neither Eragon nor Murtagh lowered his weapon Eragons palm tingled He heard a rustle behind him then a loud curse Startled he spun around One of the slavers had pulled the blanket off Arya revealing her face He gaped in astonishment then shouted Torkenbrand this ones an elf The men stirred with surprise while the leader spurred his horse over to Snowfire He looked down at Arya and whistled Well ow much is she worth someone asked Torkenbrand was quiet for a moment then spread his hands and said At the very least Fortunes upon fortunes The Empire will pay a mountain of gold for her The slavers yelled with excitement and pounded each other on the back A roar filled Eragons mind as Saphira banked sharply far overheadAttack now he criedBut let them escape if they run She immediately folded her wings and plummeted downward Eragon caught Murtaghs attention with a sharp signal Murtagh took the cue He smashed his elbow into a slavers face knocking the man out of his saddle and jabbed his heels into Tornac With a toss of his mane the warhorse jumped forward twirled around and reared Murtagh brandished his sword as Tornac plunged back down driving his forehooves into the back of the dismounted slaver The man screamed Before the slavers could gather their senses Eragon scrambled out of the commotion and raised his hands invoking words in the ancient language A globule of indigo fire struck the ground in the midst of the fray bursting into a fountain of molten drops that dissipated like sunwarmed dew A second later Saphira dropped from the sky and landed next to him She parted her jaws displaying her massive fangs and bellowed Behold cried Eragon over the furor I am a Rider He raised Zarroc over his head the red blade dazzling in the sunlight then pointed it at the slavers Flee if you wish to live The men shouted incoherently and scrambled over each other in their haste to escape In the confusion Torkenbrand was struck in the temple with a javelin He tumbled to the ground stunned The men ignored their fallen leader and raced away in a ragged mass casting fearful looks at Saphira Torkenbrand struggled to his knees Blood ran from his temple branching across his cheek with crimson tendrils Murtagh dismounted and strode over to him sword in hand Torkenbrand weakly raised his arm as if to ward off a blow Murtagh gazed at him coldly then swung his blade at Torkenbrands neck No shouted Eragon but it was too late Torkenbrands decapitated trunk crumpled to the ground in a puff of dirt His head landed with a hard thump Eragon rushed to Murtagh his jaw working furiously Is your brain rotten he yelled enraged Why did you kill him Murtagh wiped his sword on the back of Torkenbrands jerkin The steel left a dark stain I dont see why youre so upset Upset exploded Eragon Im well past that Did it even occur to you that we could just leave him here and continue on our way No Instead you turn into an executioner and chop off his head He was defenseless Murtagh seemed perplexed by Eragons wrath Well we couldnt keep him aroundhewas dangerous The others ran off without a horse he wouldnt have made it far I didnt want the Urgals to find him and learn about Arya So I thought it would But tokill him interrupted Eragon Saphira sniffed Torkenbrands head curiously She opened her mouth slightly as if to snap it up then appeared to decide better of it and prowled to Eragons side Im only trying to stay alive stated Murtagh No strangers life is more important than my own But you cant indulge in wanton violence Where is your empathy growled Eragon pointing at the head Empathy Empathy What empathy can I afford my enemies Shall I dither about whether to defend myself because it will cause someone pain If that had been the case I would have died years ago You must be willing to protect yourself and what you cherish no matter what the cost Eragon slammed Zarroc back into its sheath shaking his head savagely You can justify any atrocity with that reasoning Do you think I enjoy this Murtagh shouted My life has been threatened from the day I was born All of my waking hours have been spent avoiding danger in one form or another And sleep never comes easily because I always worry if Ill live to see the dawn If there ever was a time I felt secure it must have been in my mothers womb though I wasnt safe even there You dont understandif you lived with thisfear you would have learned the same lesson I didDo not take chances He gestured at Torkenbrands body He was a risk that I removed I refuse to repent and I wont plague myself over what is done and past Eragon shoved his face into Murtaghs It was still the wrong thing to do He lashed Arya to Saphira then climbed onto Snowfire Lets go Murtagh guided Tornac around Torkenbrands prone form in the bloodstained dust They rode at a rate that Eragon would have thought impossible a week ago leagues melted away before them as if wings were attached to their feet They turned south between two outstretched arms of the Beor Mountains The arms were shaped like pincers about to close the tips a days travel apart Yet the distance seemed less because of the mountains size It was as if they were in a valley made for giants When they stopped for the day Eragon and Murtagh ate dinner in silence refusing to look up from their food Afterward Eragon said tersely Ill take the first watch Murtagh nodded and lay on his blankets with his back to Eragon Do you want to talkasked Saphira Not right nowmurmured EragonGive me some time to think Im confused She withdrew from his mind with a gentle touch and a whisperI love you little one And I youhe said She curled into a ball next to him lending him her warmth He sat motionless in the dark wrestling with his disquiet F LIGHTTHROUGHTHEVALLEY In the morning Saphira took off with both Eragon and Arya Eragon wanted to get away from Murtagh for a time He shivered pulling his clothes tighter It looked like it might snow Saphira ascended lazily on an updraft and askedWhat are you thinking Eragon contemplated the Beor Mountains which towered above them even though Saphira flew far above the groundThat was murder yesterday Ive no other word for it Saphira banked to the left It was a hasty deed and ill considered but Murtagh tried to do the right thing The men who buy and sell other humans deserve every misfortune that befalls them If we werent committed to helping Arya I would hunt down every slaver and tear them apart Yessaid Eragon miserablybut Torkenbrand was helpless He couldnt shield himself or run A moment more and he probably would have surrendered Murtagh didnt give him that chance If Torkenbrand had at least been able to fight it wouldnt have been so bad Eragon even if Torkenbrand had fought the results would have been the same You know as well as I do that few can equal you or Murtagh with the blade Torkenbrand would have still died though you seem to think it would have been more just or honorable in a mismatched duel I dont know whats rightadmitted Eragon distressedThere arent any answers that make sense Sometimessaid Saphira gentlythere are no answers Learn what you can about Murtagh from this Then forgive him And if you cant forgive at least forget for he meant you no harm however rash the act was Your head is still attached yes Frowning Eragon shifted in the saddle He shook himself like a horse trying to rid itself of a fly and checked Murtaghs position over Saphiras shoulder A patch of color farther back along their route caught his attention Camped by a streambed they had crossed late yesterday were the Urgals Eragons heartbeat quickened How could the Urgals be on foot yet still gain on them Saphira saw the monsters as well and tilted her wings brought them close to her body and slipped into a steep dive splitting the airI dont think they spotted us she said Eragon hoped not He squinted against the blast of air as she increased the angle of their diveTheir chieftain must be driving them at a breakneck pace he said Yesmaybe theyll all die of exhaustion When they landed Murtagh asked curtly What now The Urgals are overtaking us said Eragon He pointed back toward the columns camp How far do we still have to go asked Murtagh putting his hands against the sky and measuring the hours until sunset Normally I would guess another five days At the speed weve been traveling only three But unless we get there tomorrow the Urgals will probably catch us and Arya will certainly die She might last another day We cant count on it objected Eragon The only way we can get to the Varden in time is if we dont stop for anything least of all sleep Thats our only chance Murtagh laughed bitterly How can you expect to do that Weve already gone days without adequate sleep Unless Riders are made of different stuff than us mortals youre as tired as I am Weve covered a staggering distance and the horses in case you havent noticed are ready to drop Another day of this might kill us all Eragon shrugged So be it We dont have a choice Murtagh gazed at the mountains I could leave and let you fly ahead with Saphira That would force the Urgals to divide their troops and would give you a better chance of reaching the Varden It would be suicide said Eragon crossing his arms Somehow those Urgals are faster on foot than we are on horseback They would run you down like a deer The only way to evade them is to find sanctuary with the Varden Despite his words he was unsure if he wanted Murtagh to stayI like him Eragon confessed to himselfbut Im no longer certain if thats a good thing Ill escape later said Murtagh abruptly When we get to the Varden I can disappear down a side valley and find my way to Surda where I can hide without attracting too much attention So youre staying Sleep or no sleep Ill see you to the Varden promised Murtagh With newfound determination they struggled to distance themselves from the Urgals yet their pursuers continued to creep nearer At nightfall the monsters were a third closer than they had been that morning As fatigue eroded his and Murtaghs strength they slept in turns on the horses while whoever was awake led the animals in the right direction Eragon relied heavily on Aryas memories to guide them Because of the alien nature of her mind he sometimes made mistakes as to the route costing them precious time They gradually angled toward the foothills of the eastern arm of mountains looking for the valley that would lead them to the Varden Midnight arrived and passed without any sign of it When the sun returned they were pleased to see that the Urgals were far behind This is the last day said Eragon yawning widely If were not reasonably close to the Varden by noon Im going to fly ahead with Arya Youll be free to go wherever you want then but youll have to take Snowfire with you I wont be able to come back for him That might not be necessary we could still get there in time said Murtagh He rubbed the pommel of his sword Eragon shrugged We could He went to Arya and put a hand on her forehead It was damp and dangerously hot Her eyes wandered uneasily beneath her eyelids as if she suffered a nightmare Eragon pressed a damp rag to her brow wishing he could do more Late in the morning after they circumnavigated an especially broad mountain Eragon saw a narrow valley tucked against its far side The valley was so restricted it could easily be overlooked The Beartooth River which Arya had mentioned flowed out of it and looped carelessly across the land He smiled with relief that was where they needed to go Looking back Eragon was alarmed to see that the distance between them and the Urgals had shrunk to little more than a league He pointed out the valley to Murtagh If we can slip in there without being seen it might confuse them Murtagh looked skeptical Its worth a try But theyve followed us easily enough so far As they approached the valley they passed under the knotted branches of the Beor Mountains forest The trees were tall with creviced bark that was almost black dull needles of the same color and knobby roots that rose from the soil like bare knees Cones littered the ground each the size of a horses head Sable squirrels chattered from the treetops and eyes gleamed from holes in the trunks Green beards of tangled wolfsbane hung from the gnarled branches The forest gave Eragon an uneasy feeling the hair on the back of his neck prickled There was something hostile in the air as if the trees resented their intrusionThey are very old said Saphira touching a trunk with her nose Yessaid Eragonbut not friendly The forest grew denser the farther in they traveled The lack of space forced Saphira to take off with Arya Without a clear trail to follow the tough underbrush slowed Eragon and Murtagh The Beartooth River wound next to them filling the air with the sound of gurgling water A nearby peak obscured the sun casting them into premature dusk At the valleys mouth Eragon realized that although it looked like a slim gash between the peaks the valley was really as wide as many of the Spines vales It was only the enormous size of the ridged and shadowy mountains that made it appear so confined Waterfalls dotted its sheer sides The sky was reduced to a thin strip winding overhead mostly hidden by gray clouds From the dank ground rose a clinging fog that chilled the air until their breath was visible Wild strawberries crawled among a carpet of mosses and ferns fighting for the meager sunlight Sprouting on piles of rotting wood were red and yellow toadstools All was hushed and quiet sounds dampened by the heavy air Saphira landed by them in a nearby glade the rush of her wings strangely muted She took in the view with a swing of her headI just passed a flock of birds that were black and green with red markings on their wings Ive never seen birds like that before Everything in these mountains seems unusualreplied EragonDo you mind if I ride you awhile I want to keep an eye on the Urgals Of course He turned to Murtagh The Varden are hidden at the end of this valley If we hurry we might get there before nightfall Murtagh grunted hands on his hips How am I going to get out of here I dont see any valleys joining this one and the Urgals are going to hem us in pretty soon I need an escape route Dont worry about it said Eragon impatiently This is a long valley theres sure to be an exit further in He released Arya from Saphira and lifted the elf onto Snowfire Watch AryaIm going to fly with Saphira Well meet you up ahead He scrambled onto Saphiras back and strapped himself onto her saddle Be careful Murtagh warned his brow furrowed in thought then clucked to the horses and hurried back into the forest As Saphira jumped toward the sky Eragon saidDo you think you could fly up to one of those peaks We might be able to spot our destination as well as a passage for Murtagh I dont want to listen to him griping through the entire valley We can tryagreed Saphirabut it will get much colder Im dressed warmly Hold on thenSaphira suddenly swooped straight up throwing him back in the saddle Her wings flapped strongly driving their weight upward The valley shrank to a green line below them The Beartooth River shimmered like braided silver where light struck it They rose to the cloud layer and icy moisture saturated the air A formless gray blanket engulfed them limiting their vision to an arms length Eragon hoped they would not collide with anything in the murk He stuck out a hand experimentally swinging it through the air Water condensed on it and ran down his arm soaking his sleeve A blurred gray mass fluttered past his head and he glimpsed a dove its wings pumping frantically There was a white band around its leg Saphira struck at the bird tongue lashing out jaws gaping The dove squawked as Saphiras sharp teeth snapped together a hairs breadth behind its tail feathers Then it darted away and disappeared into the haze the frenzied thumping of its wings fading to silence When they breached the top of the clouds Saphiras scales were covered with thousands of water droplets that reflected tiny rainbows and shimmered with the blue of her scales Eragon shook himself spraying water from his clothes and shivered He could no longer see the ground only hills of clouds snaking between the mountains The trees on the mountains gave way to thick glaciers blue and white under the sun The glare from the snow forced Eragon to close his eyes He tried to open them after a minute but the light dazzled him Irritated he stared into the crook of his armHow can you stand it he asked Saphira My eyes are stronger than yoursshe replied It was frigid The water in Eragons hair froze giving him a shiny helmet His shirt and pants were hard shells around his limbs Saphiras scales became slick with ice hoarfrost laced her wings They had never flown this high before yet the mountaintops were still miles above them Saphiras flapping gradually slowed and her breathing became labored Eragon gasped and panted there didnt seem to be enough air Fighting back panic he clutched Saphiras neck spikes for support We have to get out of herehe said Red dots swam before his eyesI cant breathe Saphira seemed not to hear him so he repeated the message louder this time Again there was no responseShe cant hear me he realized He swayed finding it hard to think then pounded on her side and shouted Take us down The effort made him lightheaded His vision faded into swirling darkness He regained consciousness as they emerged from the bottom of the clouds His head was poundingWhat happened he asked pushing himself upright and looking around with confusion You blacked outanswered Saphira He tried to run his fingers through his hair but stopped when he felt iciclesYes I know that but why didnt you answer me My brain was confused Your words didnt make any sense When you lost consciousness I knew something was wrong and descended I didnt have to sink far before I realized what had occurred Its a good thing you didnt pass out as wellsaid Eragon with a nervous laugh Saphira only swished her tail He looked wistfully at where the mountain peaks were now concealed by cloudsA pity we couldnt stand upon one of those summits Well now we know we can only fly out of this valley the way we came in Why did we run out of air How can we have it down here but not up above I dont know but Ill never dare to fly so close to the sun again We should remember this experience The knowledge may be useful if we ever have to fight another Rider I hope that never happenssaid EragonLets stay down below for now Ive had enough adventure for one day They floated on the gentle air currents drifting from one mountain to the next until Eragon saw that the Urgal column had reached the valleys mouthWhat drives them to such speed and how can they bear to sustain it Now that we are closer to themSaphira saidI can see that these Urgals are bigger than the ones weve met before They would stand chest and shoulders over a tall man I dont know what land they march from but it must be a fierce place to produce such brutes Eragon glared at the ground belowhe could not see the detail that she didIf they keep to this pace theyll catch Murtagh before we find the Varden Have hope The forest may hamper their progress Would it be possible to stop them with magic Eragon shook his headStop them no There are too many He thought of the thin layer of mist on the valley floor and grinnedBut I might be able to delay them a bit He closed his eyes selected the words he needed stared at the mist and then commanded Gath un reisa du rakr There was a disturbance below From above it looked as if the ground was flowing together like a great sluggish river A leaden band of mist gathered in front of the Urgals and thickened into an intimidating wall dark as a thunderhead The Urgals hesitated before it then continued forward like an unstoppable battering ram The barrier swirled around them concealing the lead ranks from view The drain on Eragons strength was sudden and massive making his heart flutter like a dying bird He gasped eyes rolling He struggled to sever the magics hold on himto plug the breach through which his life streamed With a savage growl he jerked away from the magic and broke contact Tendrils of magic snapped through his mind like decapitated snakes then reluctantly retreated from his consciousness clutching at the dregs of his strength The wall of mist dissipated and the fog sluggishly collapsed across the ground like a tower of mud sliding apart The Urgals had not been hindered at all Eragon lay limply on Saphira panting Only now did he remember Brom saying Magic is affected by distance just like an arrow or a spear If you try to lift or move something a mile away itll take more energy than if you were closerI wont forget that again he thought grimly You shouldnt have forgotten in the first placeSaphira inserted pointedlyFirst the dirt at Gilead and now this Werent you paying attention to anything Brom told you Youll kill yourself if you keep this up I paid attentionhe insisted rubbing his chin Its just been a while and I havent had an opportunity to think back on it Ive never used magic at a distance so how could I know it would be so difficult She growledNext thing I know youll be trying to bring corpses back to life Dont forget what Brom said about that too I wonthe said impatiently Saphira dipped toward the ground searching for Murtagh and the horses Eragon would have helped her but he barely had the energy to sit up Saphira settled in a small field with a jolt and Eragon was puzzled to see the horses stopped and Murtagh kneeling examining the ground When Eragon did not dismount Murtagh hurried over and inquired Whats wrong He sounded angry worried and tired at the same time I made a mistake said Eragon truthfully The Urgals have entered the valley I tried to confuse them but I forgot one of the rules of magic and it cost me a great deal Scowling Murtagh jerked his thumb over his shoulder I just found some wolf tracks but the footprints are as wide as both of my hands and an inch deep There are animals around here that could be dangerous even to you Saphira He turned to her I know you cant enter the forest but could you circle above me and the horses That should keep these beasts away Otherwise there may only be enough left of me to roast in a thimble Humor Murtagh asked Eragon a quick smile coming to his face His muscles trembled making it hard for him to concentrate Only on the gallows Murtagh rubbed his eyes I cant believe that the same Urgals have been following us the whole time They would have to be birds to catch up with us Saphira said theyre larger than any weve seen remarked Eragon Murtagh cursed clenching the pommel of his sword That explains it Saphira if youre right then those are Kull elite of the Urgals I should have guessed that the chieftain had been put in charge of them They dont ride because horses cant carry their weightnot one of them is under eight feet talland they can run for days without sleep and still be ready for battle It can take five men to kill one Kull never leave their caves except for war so they must expect a great slaughter if they are out in such force Can we stay ahead of them Who knows said Murtagh Theyre strong determined and large in numbers Its possible that we may have to face them If that happens I only hope that the Varden have men posted nearby wholl help us Despite our skill and Saphira we cant hold off Kull Eragon swayed Could you get me some bread I need to eat Murtagh quickly brought him part of a loaf It was old and hard but Eragon chewed on it gratefully Murtagh scanned the valley walls worry in his eyes Eragon knew he was searching for a way out Therell be one farther in Of course said Murtagh with forced optimism then slapped his thigh We must go How is Arya asked Eragon Murtagh shrugged The fevers worse Shes been tossing and turning What do you expect Her strength is failing You should fly her to the Varden before the poison does any more damage I wont leave you behind insisted Eragon gaining strength with each bite Not with the Urgals so near Murtagh shrugged again As you wish But Im warning you she wont live if you stay with me Dont say that insisted Eragon pushing himself upright in Saphiras saddle Help me save her We can still do it Consider it a life for a lifeatonement for Torkenbrands death Murtaghs face darkened instantly Its not a debt owed You He stopped as a horn echoed through the dark forest Ill have more to say to you later he said shortly stomping to the horses He grabbed their reins and trotted away shooting an angry glare at Eragon Eragon closed his eyes as Saphira took flight He wished that he could lie on a soft bed and forget all their troubles Saphirahe said at last cupping his ears to warm them what if we did take Arya to the Varden Once she was safe we could fly back to Murtagh and help him out of here The Varden wouldnt let yousaid SaphiraFor all they know you might be returning to inform the Urgals of their hiding place We arent arriving under the best conditions to gain their trust Theyll want to know why weve brought an entire company of Kull to their very gates Well just have to tell them the truth and hope they believe ussaid Eragon And what will we do if the Kull attack Murtagh Fight them of course I wont let him and Arya be captured or killedsaid Eragon indignantly There was a touch of sarcasm in her wordsHow noble Oh we would fell many of the Urgalsyou with magic and blade whilst my weapons would be tooth and clawbut it would be futile in the end They are too numerous We can not defeat them only be defeated What thenhe demandedIll not leave Arya or Murtagh to their mercy Saphira waved her tail the tip whistling loudlyIm not asking you to However if we attack first we may gain the advantage Have you gone crazy Theyll Eragons voice trailed off as he thought about itThey wont be able to do a thing he concluded surprised Exactlysaid SaphiraWe can inflict lots of damage from a safe height Lets drop rocks on themproposed EragonThat should scatter them If their skulls arent thick enough to protect themSaphira banked to the right and quickly descended to the Beartooth River She grasped a midsized boulder with her strong talons while Eragon scooped up several fistsized rocks Laden with the stones Saphira glided on silent wings until they were over the Urgal hostNow she exclaimed releasing the boulder There were muffled cracks as the missiles plummeted through the forest top smashing branches A second later howls echoed through the valley Eragon smiled tightly as he heard the Urgals scramble for coverLets find more ammunition he suggested bending low over Saphira She growled in agreement and returned to the riverbed It was hard work but they were able to hinder the Urgals progressthough it was impossible to stop them altogether The Urgals gained ground whenever Saphira went for stones Despite that their efforts allowed Murtagh to stay ahead of the advancing column The valley darkened as the hours slipped by Without the sun to provide warmth the sharp bite of frost crept into the air and the ground mist froze on the trees coating them white Night animals began to creep from their dens to peer from shadowed hideouts at the strangers trespassing on their land Eragon continued to examine the mountainsides searching for the waterfall that would signify the end of their journey He was painfully aware that every passing minute brought Arya closer to death Faster faster he muttered to himself looking down at Murtagh Before Saphira scooped up more rocks he saidLets take a respite and check on Arya The day is almost over and Im afraid her life is measured in hours if not minutes Aryas life is in Fates hands now You made your choice to stay with Murtagh its too late to change that so stop agonizing over it Youre making my scales itch The best thing we can do right now is to keep bombarding the UrgalsEragon knew she was right yet her words did nothing to calm his anxiety He resumed his search for the waterfall but whatever lay before them was hidden by a thick mountain ridge True darkness began to fill the valley settling over the trees and mountains like an inky cloud Even with her keen hearing and delicate sense of smell Saphira could no longer locate the Urgals through the dense forest There was no moon to help them it would be hours before it rose above the mountains Saphira made a long gentle left turn and glided around the mountain ridge Eragon vaguely sensed it pass by them then squinted as he saw a faint white line aheadCould that be the waterfall he wondered He looked at the sky which still held the afterglow of sunset The mountains dark silhouettes curved together and formed a rough bowl that closed off the valleyThe head of the valley isnt much farther he exclaimed pointing at the mountainsDo you think that the Varden know were coming Maybe theyll send men out to help us I doubt theyll assist us until they know if we are friend or foeSaphira said as she abruptly dropped toward the groundIm returning to Murtaghwe should stay with him now Since I cant find the Urgals they could sneak up on him without us knowing Eragon loosened Zarroc in its sheath wondering if he was strong enough to fight Saphira landed to the left of the Beartooth River then crouched expectantly The waterfall rumbled in the distanceHe comes she said Eragon strained his ears and caught the sound of pounding hooves Murtagh ran out of the forest driving the horses before him He saw them but did not slow Eragon jumped off Saphira stumbling a bit as he matched Murtaghs pace Behind him Saphira went to the river so she could follow them without being hindered by the trees Before Eragon could relay his news Murtagh said I saw you dropping rocks with Saphiraambitious Have the Kull stopped or turned back Theyre still behind us but were almost to the head of the valley Hows Arya She hasnt died Murtagh said harshly His breath came in short bursts His next words were deceptively calm like those of a man concealing a terrible passion Is there a valley or gorge ahead that I can leave through Apprehensive Eragon tried to remember if he had seen any breaks in the mountains around them he had not thought about Murtaghs dilemma for a while Its dark he began evasively dodging a low branch so I might have missed something but no Murtagh swore explosively and came to an abrupt stop dragging on the horses reins until they halted as well Are you saying that the only place I can go is to the Varden Yes but keep running The Urgals are almost upon us No said Murtagh angrily He stabbed a finger at Eragon I warned you that I wouldnt go to the Varden but you went ahead and trapped me between a hammer and an anvil Youre the one with the elfs memories Why didnt you tell me this was a dead end Eragon bristled at the barrage and retorted All I knew was where we had to go not what lay in between Dont blame me for choosing to come Murtaghs breath hissed between his teeth as he furiously spun away All Eragon could see of him was a motionless bowed figure His own shoulders were tense and a vein throbbed on the side of his neck He put his hands on his hips impatience rising Why have you stoppedasked Saphira alarmed Dont distract meWhats your quarrel with the Varden It cant be so terrible that you must keep it hidden even now Would you rather fight the Kull than reveal it How many times will we go through this before you trust me There was a long silence The Urgalsreminded Saphira urgently I knowsaid Eragon pushing back his temperBut we have to resolve this Quickly quickly Murtagh said Eragon earnestly unless you wish to die we must go to the Varden Dont let me walk into their arms without knowing how they will react to you Its going to be dangerous enough without unnecessary surprises Finally Murtagh turned to Eragon His breathing was hard and fast like that of a cornered wolf He paused then said with a tortured voice You have a right to know I I am the son of Morzan first and last of the Forsworn T HEHORNS OFADILEMMA Eragon was speechless Disbelief roared through his mind as he tried to reject Murtaghs wordsThe Forsworn never had any children least of all Morzan Morzan The man who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix and remained the kings favorite servant for the rest of his life Could it be true Saphiras own shock reached him a second later She crashed through trees and brush as she barreled from the river to his side fangs bared tail raised threateninglyBe ready for anything she warnedHe may be able to use magic You are his heir asked Eragon surreptitiously reaching for ZarrocWhat could he want with me Is he really working for the king I didnt choose this cried Murtagh anguish twisting his face He ripped at his clothes with a desperate air tearing off his tunic and shirt to bare his torso Look he pleaded and turned his back to Eragon Unsure Eragon leaned forward straining his eyes in the darkness There against Murtaghs tanned and muscled skin was a knotted white scar that stretched from his right shoulder to his left hipa testament to some terrible agony See that demanded Murtagh bitterly He talked quickly now as if relieved to have his secret finally revealed I was only three when I got it During one of his many drunken rages Morzan threw his sword at me as I ran by My back was laid open by the very sword you now carrythe only thing I expected to receive as inheritance until Brom stole it from my fathers corpse I was lucky I supposethere was a healer nearby who kept me from dying You must understand I dont love the Empire or the king I have no allegiance to them nor do I mean you harm His pleas were almost frantic Eragon uneasily lifted his hand from Zarrocs pommel Then your father he said in a faltering voice was killed by Yes Brom said Murtagh He pulled his tunic back on with a detached air A horn rang out behind them prompting Eragon to cry Come run with me Murtagh shook the horses reins and forced them into a tired trot eyes fixed straight ahead while Arya bounced limply in Snowfires saddle Saphira stayed by Eragons side easily keeping pace with her long legsYou could walk unhindered in the riverbed he said as she was forced to smash through a dense web of branches Ill not leave you with him Eragon was glad for her protectionMorzans son He said between strides Your tale is hard to believe How do I know you arent lying Why would I lie You could be Murtagh interrupted him quickly I cant prove anything to you now Keep your doubts until we reach the Varden Theyll recognize me quickly enough I must know pressed Eragon Do you serve the Empire No And if I did what would I accomplish by traveling with you If I were trying to capture or kill you I would have left you in prison Murtagh stumbled as he jumped over a fallen log You could be leading the Urgals to the Varden Then said Murtagh shortly why am I still with you I know where the Varden are now What reason could I have for delivering myself to them If I were going to attack them Id turn around and join the Urgals Maybe youre an assassin stated Eragon flatly Maybe You cant really know can you SaphiraEragon asked simply Her tail swished over his headIf he wanted to harm you he could have done it long ago A branch whipped Eragons neck causing a line of blood to appear on his skin The waterfall was growing louderI want you to watch Murtagh closely when we get to the Varden He may do something foolish and I dont want him killed by accident Ill do my bestshe said as she shouldered her way between two trees scraping off slabs of bark The horn sounded behind them again Eragon glanced over his shoulder expecting Urgals to rush out of the darkness The waterfall throbbed dully ahead of them drowning out the sounds of the night The forest ended and Murtagh pulled the horses to a stop They were on a pebble beach directly to the left of the mouth of the Beartooth River The deep lake Kósthamérna filled the valley blocking their way The water gleamed with flickering starlight The mountain walls restricted passage around Kósthamérna to a thin strip of shore on either side of the lake both no more than a few steps wide At the lakes far end a broad sheet of water tumbled down a black cliff into boiling mounds of froth Do we go to the falls asked Murtagh tightly Yes Eragon took the lead and picked his way along the lakes left side The pebbles underfoot were damp and slime covered There was barely enough room for Saphira between the sheer valley wall and the lake she had to walk with two feet in the water They were halfway to the waterfall when Murtagh warned Urgals Eragon whirled around rocks spraying from under his heel By the shore of Kósthamérna where they had been only minutes before hulking figures streamed out of the forest The Urgals massed before the lake One of them gestured at Saphira guttural words drifted over the water Immediately the horde split and started around both sides of the lake leaving Eragon and Murtagh without an escape route The narrow shore forced the bulky Kull to march single file Run barked Murtagh drawing his sword and slapping the horses on their flanks Saphira took off without warning and wheeled back toward the Urgals No cried Eragon shouting with his mindCome back but she continued heedless to his pleas With an agonizing effort he tore his gaze from her and plunged forward wrenching Zarroc from its sheath Saphira dived at the Urgals bellowing fiercely They tried to scatter but were trapped against the mountainside She caught a Kull between her talons and carried the screaming creature aloft tearing at him with her fangs The silent body crashed into the lake a moment later an arm and a leg missing The Kull continued around Kósthamérna undeterred With smoke streaming from her nostrils Saphira dived at them again She twisted and rolled as a cloud of black arrows shot toward her Most of the darts glanced off her scaled sides leaving no more than bruises but she roared as the rest pierced her wings Eragons arms twinged with sympathetic pain and he had to restrain himself from rushing to her defense Fear flooded his veins as he saw the line of Urgals closing in on them He tried to run faster but his muscles were too tired the rocks too slippery Then with a loud splash Saphira plunged into Kósthamérna She submerged completely sending ripples across the lake The Urgals nervously eyed the dark water lapping their feet One growled something indecipherable and jabbed his spear at the lake The water exploded as Saphiras head shot out of the depths Her jaws closed on the spear breaking it like a twig as she tore it out of the Kulls hands with a vicious twist Before she could seize the Urgal himself his companions thrust at her with their spears bloodying her nose Saphira jerked back and hissed angrily beating the water with her tail Keeping his spear pointed at her the lead Kull tried to edge past but halted when she snapped at his legs The string of Urgals was forced to stop as she held him at bay Meanwhile the Kull on the other side of the lake still hurried toward the falls Ive trapped themshe told Eragon terselybut hurryI can not hold them long Archers on the shore were already taking aim at her Eragon concentrated on going faster but a rock gave under his boot and he pitched forward Murtaghs strong arm kept him on his feet and clasping each others forearms they urged the horses forward with shouts They were almost to the waterfall The noise was overwhelming like an avalanche A white wall of water gushed down the cliff pounding the rocks below with a fury that sent mist spraying through the air to run down their faces Four yards from the thunderous curtain the beach widened giving them room to maneuver Saphira roared as an Urgal spear grazed her haunch then retreated underwater With her withdrawal the Kull rushed forward with long strides They were only a few hundred feet away What do we do now Murtagh demanded coldly I dont know Let me think cried Eragon searching Aryas memories for her final instructions He scanned the ground until he found a rock the size of an apple grabbed it then pounded on the cliff next to the falls shouting Aí varden abr du Shurtugals gata vanta Nothing happened He tried again shouting louder than before but only succeeded in bruising his hand He turned in despair to Murtagh Were trap His words were cut off as Saphira leapt out of the lake dousing them with icy water She landed on the beach and crouched ready to fight The horses backpedaled wildly trying to bolt Eragon reached out with his mind to steady themBehind you cried Saphira He turned and glimpsed the lead Urgal running at him heavy spear raised Up close a Kull was as tall as a small giant with legs and arms as thick as tree trunks Murtagh drew back his arm and threw his sword with incredible speed The long weapon revolved once then struck the Kull point first in the chest with a dull crunch The huge Urgal toppled to the ground with a strangled gurgle Before another Kull could attack Murtagh dashed forward and yanked his sword out of the body Eragon raised his palm shouting Jierda theirra kalfis Sharp cracks resounded off the cliff Twenty of the charging Urgals fell into Kósthamérna howling and clutching their legs where shards of bone protruded Without breaking stride the rest of the Urgals advanced over their fallen companions Eragon struggled against his weariness putting a hand on Saphira for support A flight of arrows impossible to see in the darkness brushed past them and clattered against the cliff Eragon and Murtagh ducked covering their heads With a small growl Saphira jumped over them so that her armored sides shielded them and the horses A chorus of clinks sounded as a second volley of arrows bounced off her scales What now shouted Murtagh There was still no opening in the cliff We cant stay here Eragon heard Saphira snarl as an arrow caught the edge of her wing tearing the thin membrane He looked around wildly trying to understand why Aryas instructions had not worked I dont know This is where were supposed to be Why dont you ask the elf to make sure demanded Murtagh He dropped his sword snatched his bow from Tornacs saddlebags and with a swift motion loosed an arrow from between the spikes on Saphiras back A moment later an Urgal toppled into the water Now Shes barely alive Hows she going to find the energy to say anything I dontknow shouted Murtagh but youd better think ofsomething because we cant stave off an entire army Eragongrowled Saphira urgently What Were on the wrong side of the lake Ive seen Aryas memories through you and I just realized that this isnt the right placeShe tucked her head against her breast as another flight of arrows sped toward them Her tail flicked in pain as they struck herI cant keep this up Theyre tearing me to pieces Eragon slammed Zarroc back into its sheath and exclaimed The Varden are on the other side of the lake We have to go through the waterfall He noted with dread that the Urgals across Kósthamérna were almost to the falls Murtaghs eyes shot toward the violent deluge blocking their way Well never get the horses through there even if we can hold our own footing Ill convince them to follow us snapped Eragon And Saphira can carry Arya The Urgals cries and bellows made Snowfire snort angrily The elf lolled on his back oblivious to the danger Murtagh shrugged Its better than being hacked to death He swiftly cut Arya loose from Snowfires saddle and Eragon caught the elf as she slid to the ground Im readysaid Saphira rising into a halfcrouch The approaching Urgals hesitated unsure of her intentions Now cried Eragon He and Murtagh heaved Arya onto Saphira then secured her legs in the saddles straps The second they were finished Saphira swept up her wings and soared over the lake The Urgals behind her howled as they saw her escaping Arrows clattered off her belly The Kull on the other shore redoubled their pace so as to attain the waterfall before she landed Eragon reached out with his mind to force himself into the frightened thoughts of the horses Using the ancient language he told them that unless they swam through the waterfall they would be killed and eaten by the Urgals Though they did not understand everything he said the meaning of his words was unmistakable Snowfire and Tornac tossed their heads then dashed into the thundering downpour whinnying as it struck their backs They floundered struggling to stay above water Murtagh sheathed his sword and jumped after them his head disappeared under a froth of bubbles before he bobbed up sputtering The Urgals were right behind Eragon he could hear their feet crunching on the gravel With a fierce war cry he leapt after Murtagh closing his eyes a second before the cold water pummeled him The tremendous weight of the waterfall slammed down on his shoulders with backbreaking force The waters mindless roar filled his ears He was driven to the bottom where his knees gouged the rocky lakebed He kicked off with all his strength and shot partway out of the water Before he could take a gulp of air the cascade rammed him back underwater All he could see was a white blur as foam billowed around him He frantically tried to surface and relieve his burning lungs but he only rose a few feet before the deluge halted his ascent He panicked thrashing his arms and legs fighting the water Weighed down by Zarroc and his drenched clothes he sank back to the lakebed unable to speak the ancient words that could save him Suddenly a strong hand grasped the back of his tunic and dragged him through the water His rescuer sliced through the lake with quick short strokes Eragon hoped it was Murtagh not an Urgal They surfaced and stumbled onto the pebble beach Eragon was trembling violently his entire body shivered in bursts Sounds of combat erupted to his right and he whirled toward them expecting an Urgal attack The monsters on the opposite shorewhere he had stood only moments beforefell beneath a withering hail of arrows from crevasses that pockmarked the cliff Scores of Urgals already floated belly up in the water riddled with shafts The ones on Eragons shore were similarly engaged Neither group could retreat from their exposed positions for rows of warriors had somehow appeared behind them where the lake met the mountainsides All that prevented the nearest Kull from rushing Eragon was the steady rain of arrowsthe unseen archers seemed determined to keep the Urgals at bay A gruff voice next to Eragon said Akh Guntéraz dorzâda What were they thinking You would have drowned Eragon jerked with surprise It was not Murtagh standing by him but a diminutive man no taller than his elbow The dwarf was busy wringing water out of his long braided beard His chest was stocky and he wore a chainmail jacket cut off at the shoulders to reveal muscular arms A war ax hung from a wide leather belt strapped around his waist An ironbound oxhide cap bearing the symbol of a hammer surrounded by twelve stars sat firmly on his head Even with the cap he barely topped four feet He looked longingly at the fighting and said Barzul but I wish I could join them A dwarfEragon drew Zarroc and looked for Saphira and Murtagh Two twelvefootthick stone doors had opened in the cliff revealing a broad tunnel nearly thirty feet tall that burrowed its way into the mysterious depths of the mountain A line of flameless lamps filled the passageway with a pale sapphire light that spilled out onto the lake Saphira and Murtagh stood before the tunnel surrounded by a grim mixture of men and dwarves At Murtaghs elbow was a bald beardless man dressed in purple and gold robes He was taller than all the other humansand he was holding a dagger to Murtaghs throat Eragon reached for his power but the robed man said in a sharp dangerous voice Stop If you use magic Ill kill your lovely friend here who was so kind as to mention youre a Rider Dont think I wont know if youre drawing upon it You cant hide anything from me Eragon tried to speak but the man snarled and pressed the dagger harder against Murtaghs throat None of that If you say or do anything I dont tell you to he will die Now everyone inside He backed into the tunnel pulling Murtagh with him and keeping his eyes on Eragon Saphira what should I doEragon asked quickly as the men and dwarves followed Murtaghs captor leading the horses along with them Go with themshe counseledand hope that we live She entered the tunnel herself eliciting nervous glances from those around her Reluctantly Eragon followed her aware that the warriors eyes were upon him His rescuer the dwarf walked alongside him with a hand on the haft of his war ax Utterly exhausted Eragon staggered into the mountain The stone doors swung shut behind them with only a whisper of sound He looked back and saw a seamless wall where the opening had been They were trapped inside But were they any safer H UNTING FORANSWERS This way snapped the bald man He stepped back keeping the dagger pressed under Murtaghs chin then wheeled to the right disappearing through an arched doorway The warriors cautiously followed him their attention centered on Eragon and Saphira The horses were led into a different tunnel Dazed by the turn of events Eragon started after Murtagh He glanced at Saphira to confirm that Arya was still tied to her backShe has to get the antidote he thought frantically knowing that even then the Skilna Bragh was fulfilling its deadly purpose within her flesh He hurried through the arched doorway and down a narrow corridor after the bald man The warriors kept their weapons pointed at him They swept past a sculpture of a peculiar animal with thick quills The corridor curved sharply to the left then to the right A door opened and they entered a bare room large enough for Saphira to move around with ease There was a hollow boom as the door closed followed by a loud scrape as a bolt was secured on the outside Eragon slowly examined his surroundings Zarroc tight in his hand The walls floor and ceiling were made of polished white marble that reflected a ghost image of everyone like a mirror of veined milk One of the unusual lanterns hung in each corner Theres an injured he began but a sharp gesture from the bald man cut him off Do not speak It must wait until you have been tested He shoved Murtagh over to one of the warriors who pressed a sword against Murtaghs neck The bald man clasped his hands together softly Remove your weapons and slide them to me A dwarf unbuckled Murtaghs sword and dropped it on the floor with a clank Loath to be parted with Zarroc Eragon unfastened the sheath and set it and the blade on the floor He placed his bow and quiver next to them then pushed the pile toward the warriors Now step away from your dragon and slowly approach me commanded the bald man Puzzled Eragon moved forward When they were a yard apart the man said Stop there Now remove the defenses from around your mind and prepare to let me inspect your thoughts and memories If you try to hide anything from me I will take what I want by force which would drive you mad If you dont submit your companion will be killed Why asked Eragon aghast To be sure you arent in Galbatorixs service and to understand why hundreds of Urgals are banging on our front door growled the bald man His closeset eyes shifted from point to point with cunning speed No one may enter Farthen Dûr without being tested There isnt time We need a healer protested Eragon Silence roared the man pressing down his robe with thin fingers Until you are examined your words are meaningless But shes dying retorted Eragon angrily pointing at Arya They were in a precarious position but he would let nothing else happen until Arya was cared for It will have to wait No one will leave this room until we have discovered the truth of this matter Unless you wish The dwarf who had saved Eragon from the lake jumped forward Are you blind Egraz Carn Cant you see thats an elf on the dragon We can not keep her here if shes in danger Ajihad and the king will have our heads if shes allowed to die The mans eyes tightened with anger After a moment he relaxed and said smoothly Of course Orik we wouldnt want that to happen He snapped his fingers and pointed at Arya Remove her from the dragon Two human warriors sheathed their swords and hesitantly approached Saphira who watched them steadily Quickly quickly The men unstrapped Arya from the saddle and lowered the elf to the floor One of the men inspected her face then said sharply Its the dragonegg courier Arya What exclaimed the bald man The dwarf Oriks eyes widened with astonishment The bald man fixed his steely gaze on Eragon and said flatly You have much explaining to do Eragon returned the intense stare with all the determination he could muster She was poisoned with the Skilna Bragh while in prison Only Túnivors Nectar can save her now The bald mans face became inscrutable He stood motionless except for his lips which twitched occasionally Very well Take her to the healers and tell them what she needs Guard her until the ceremony is completed I will have new orders for you by then The warriors nodded curtly and carried Arya out of the room Eragon watched them go wishing that he could accompany her His attention snapped back to the bald man as he said Enough of this we have wasted too much time already Prepare to be examined Eragon did not want this hairless threatening man inside his mind laying bare his every thought and feeling but he knew that resistance would be useless The air was strained Murtaghs gaze burned into his forehead Finally he bowed his head I am ready Good then He was interrupted as Orik said abruptly Youd better not harm him Egraz Carn else the king will have words for you The bald man looked at him irritably then faced Eragon with a small smile Only if he resists He bowed his head and chanted several inaudible words Eragon gasped with pain and shock as a mental probe clawed its way into his mind His eyes rolled up into his head and he automatically began throwing up barriers around his consciousness The attack was incredibly powerful Dont do thatcried Saphira Her thoughts joined his filling him with strengthYoure putting Murtagh at risk Eragon faltered gritted his teeth then forced himself to remove his shielding exposing himself to the ravening probe Disappointment emanated from the bald man His battering intensified The force coming from his mind felt decayed and unwholesome there was something profoundly wrong about it He wants me to fight himcried Eragon as a fresh wave of pain racked him A second later it subsided only to be replaced by another Saphira did her best to suppress it but even she could not block it entirely Give him what he wantsshe said quicklybut protect everything else Ill help you His strength is no match for mine Im already shielding our words from him Then why does it still hurt The pain comes from you Eragon winced as the probe dug in farther hunting for information like a nail being driven through his skull The bald man roughly seized his childhood memories and began sifting through themHe doesnt need thoseget him out of there growled Eragon angrily I cant not without endangering yousaid SaphiraI can conceal things from his view but it must be done before he reaches them Think quickly and tell me what you want hidden Eragon tried to concentrate through the pain He raced through his memories starting from when he had found Saphiras egg He hid sections of his discussions with Brom including all the ancient words he had been taught Their travels through Palancar Valley Yazuac Daret and Teirm he left mostly untouched But he had Saphira conceal everything he remembered of Angelas fortunetelling and Solembum He skipped from their burglary at Teirm to Broms death to his imprisonment in Gilead and lastly to Murtaghs revelation of his true identity Eragon wanted to hide that as well but Saphira balkedThe Varden have a right to know who they shelter under their roof especially if its a son of the Forsworn Just do ithe said tightly fighting another wave of agonyI wont be the one to unmask him at least not to this man Itll be discovered as soon as Murtagh is scannedwarned Saphira sharply Just do it With the most important information hidden there was nothing else for Eragon to do but wait for the bald man to finish his inspection It was like sitting still while his fingernails were extracted with rusty tongs His entire body was rigid jaw locked tightly Heat radiated from his skin and a line of sweat rolled down his neck He was acutely aware of each second as the long minutes crept by The bald man wound through his experiences sluggishly like a thorny vine pushing its way toward the sunlight He paid keen attention to many things Eragon considered irrelevant such as his mother Selena and seemed to linger on purpose so as to prolong the suffering He spent a long time examining Eragons recollections of the Razac and then later the Shade It was not until his adventures had been exhaustively analyzed that the bald man began to withdraw from Eragons mind The probe was extracted like a splinter being removed Eragon shuddered swayed then fell toward the floor Strong arms caught him at the last second lowering him to the cool marble He heard Orik exclaim from behind him You went too far He wasnt strong enough for this Hell live Thats all that is needed answered the bald man curtly There was an angry grunt What did you find Silence Well is he to be trusted or not The words came reluctantly He is not your enemy There were audible sighs of relief throughout the room Eragons eyes fluttered open He gingerly pushed himself upright Easy now said Orik wrapping a thick arm around him and helping him to his feet Eragon wove unsteadily glaring at the bald man A low growl rumbled in Saphiras throat The bald man ignored them He turned to Murtagh who was still being held at sword point Its your turn now Murtagh stiffened and shook his head The sword cut his neck slightly Blood dripped down his skin No You will not be protected here if you refuse Eragon has been declared trustworthy so you can not threaten to kill him to influence me Since you cant do that nothing you say or do will convince me to open my mind Sneering the bald man cocked what would have been an eyebrow if he had any What of your own life I can still threaten that It wont do any good said Murtagh stonily and with such conviction that it was impossible to doubt his word The bald mans breath exploded angrily You dont have a choice He stepped forward and placed his palm on Murtaghs brow clenching his hand to hold him in place Murtagh stiffened face growing as hard as iron fists clenched neck muscles bulging He was obviously fighting the attack with all his strength The bald man bared his teeth with fury and frustration at the resistance his fingers dug mercilessly into Murtagh Eragon winced in sympathy knowing the battle that raged between themCant you help him he asked Saphira Noshe said softlyHe will allow no one into his mind Orik scowled darkly as he watched the combatants Ilf carnz orodüm he muttered then leapt forward and cried That is enough He grabbed the bald mans arm and tore him away from Murtagh with strength disproportional to his size The bald man stumbled back then turned on Orik furiously How dare you he shouted You questioned my leadership opened the gates without permission and now this Youve shown nothing but insolence and treachery Do you think your king will protect you now Orik bristled You would have let them die If I had waited any longer the Urgals would have killed them He pointed at Murtagh whose breath came in great heaves We dont have any right to torture him for information Ajihad wont sanction it Not after youve examined the Rider and found him free of faultAnd theyve brought us Arya Would you allow him to enter unchallenged Are you so great a fool as to put us all at risk demanded the bald man His eyes were feral with loosely chained rage he looked ready to tear the dwarf into pieces Can he use magic That is Can he use magic roared Orik his deep voice echoing in the room The bald mans face suddenly grew expressionless He clasped his hands behind his back No Then what do you fear Its impossible for him to escape and he cant work any devilry with all of us here especially if your powers are as great as you say But dont listen to me ask Ajihad what he wants done The bald man stared at Orik for a moment his face indecipherable then looked at the ceiling and closed his eyes A peculiar stiffness set into his shoulders while his lips moved soundlessly An intense frown wrinkled the pale skin above his eyes and his fingers clenched as if they were throttling an invisible enemy For several minutes he stood thus wrapped in silent communication When his eyes opened he ignored Orik and snapped at the warriors Leave now As they filed through the doorway he addressed Eragon coldly Because I was unable to complete my examination you and your friend will remain here for the night He will be killed if he attempts to leave With those words he turned on his heel and stalked out of the room pale scalp gleaming in the lantern light Thank you whispered Eragon to Orik The dwarf grunted Ill make sure some food is brought He muttered a string of words under his breath then left shaking his head The bolt was secured once again on the outside of the door Eragon sat feeling strangely dreamy from the days excitement and their forced march His eyelids were heavy Saphira settled next to himWe must be careful It seems we have as many enemies here as we did in the Empire He nodded too tired to talk Murtagh eyes glazed and empty leaned against the far wall and slid to the shiny floor He held his sleeve against the cut on his neck to stop the bleeding Are you all right asked Eragon Murtagh nodded jerkily Did he get anything from you No How were you able to keep him out Hes so strong Ive Ive been well trained There was a bitter note to his voice Silence enshrouded them Eragons gaze drifted to one of the lanterns hanging in a corner His thoughts meandered until he abruptly said I didnt let them know who you are Murtagh looked relieved He bowed his head Thank you for not betraying me They didnt recognize you No And you still say that you are Morzans son Yes he sighed Eragon started to speak but stopped when he felt hot liquid splash onto his hand He looked down and was startled to see a drop of dark blood roll off his skin It had fallen from Saphiras wingI forgot Youre injured he exclaimed getting up with an effortId better heal you Be careful Its easy to make mistakes when youre this tired I knowSaphira unfolded one of her wings and lowered it to the floor Murtagh watched as Eragon ran his hands over the warm blue membrane saying Waíse heill whenever he found an arrow hole Luckily all the wounds were relatively easy to heal even those on her nose Task completed Eragon slumped against Saphira breathing hard He could feel her great heart beating with the steady throb of life I hope they bring food soon said Murtagh Eragon shrugged he was too exhausted to be hungry He crossed his arms missing Zarrocs weight by his side Why are you here What If you really are Morzans son Galbatorix wouldnt let you wander around Alagaësia freely How is it that you managed to find the Razac by yourself Why is it Ive never heard of any of the Forsworn having children And what are you doing here His voice rose to a near shout at the end Murtagh ran his hands over his face Its a long story Were not going anywhere rebutted Eragon Its too late to talk There probably wont be time for it tomorrow Murtagh wrapped his arms around his legs and rested his chin on his knees rocking back and forth as he stared at the floor Its not a he said then interrupted himself I dont want to stop so make yourself comfortable My story will take a while Eragon shifted against Saphiras side and nodded Saphira watched both of them intently Murtaghs first sentence was halting but his voice gained strength and confidence as he spoke As far as I know I am the only child of the Thirteen Servants or the Forsworn as theyre called There may be others for the Thirteen had the skill to hide whatever they wanted but I doubt it for reasons Ill explain later My parents met in a small villageI never learned wherewhile my father was traveling on the kings business Morzan showed my mother some small kindness no doubt a ploy to gain her confidence and when he left she accompanied him They traveled together for a time and as is the nature of these things she fell deeply in love with him Morzan was delighted to discover this not only because it gave him numerous opportunities to torment her but also because he recognized the advantage of having a servant who wouldnt betray him Thus when Morzan returned to Galbatorixs court my mother became the tool he relied upon most He used her to carry his secret messages and he taught her rudimentary magic which helped her remain undiscovered and on occasion extract information from people He did his best to protect her from the rest of the Thirteennot out of any feelings for her but because they would have used her against him given the chance For three years things proceeded in this manner until my mother became pregnant Murtagh paused for a moment fingering a lock of his hair He continued in a clipped tone My father was if nothing else a cunning man He knew that the pregnancy put both him and my mother in danger not to mention the babythat is me So in the dead of night he spirited her away from the palace and took her to his castle Once there he laid down powerful spells that prevented anyone from entering his estate except for a few chosen servants In this way the pregnancy was kept secret from everyone but Galbatorix Galbatorix knew the intimate details of the Thirteens lives their plots their fightsand most importantlytheir thoughts He enjoyed watching them battle each other and often helped one or the other for his own amusement But for some reason he never revealed my existence I was born in due time and given to a wet nurse so my mother could return to Morzans side She had no choice in the matter Morzan allowed her to visit me every few months but otherwise we were kept apart Another three years passed like this during which time he gave me the scar on my back Murtagh brooded a minute before continuing I would have grown to manhood in this fashion if Morzan hadnt been summoned away to hunt for Saphiras egg As soon as he departed my mother who had been left behind vanished No one knows where she went or why The king tried to hunt her down but his men couldnt find her trailno doubt because of Morzans training At the time of my birth only five of the Thirteen were still alive By the time Morzan left that number had been reduced to three when he finally faced Brom in Gilead he was the only one remaining The Forsworn died through various means suicide ambush overuse of magic but it was mostly the work of the Varden Im told that the king was in a terrible rage because of those losses However before word of Morzans and the others deaths reached us my mother returned Many months had passed since she had disappeared Her health was poor as if she had suffered a great illness and she grew steadily worse Within a fortnight she died What happened then prompted Eragon Murtagh shrugged I grew up The king brought me to the palace and arranged for my upbringing Aside from that he left me alone Then why did you leave A hard laugh broke from Murtagh Escaped is more like it At my last birthday when I turned eighteen the king summoned me to his quarters for a private dinner The message surprised me because I had always distanced myself from the court and had rarely met him Wed talked before but always within earshot of eavesdropping nobles I accepted the offer of course aware that it would be unwise to refuse The meal was sumptuous but throughout it his black eyes never left me His gaze was disconcerting it seemed that he was searching for something hidden in my face I didnt know what to make of it and did my best to provide polite conversation but he refused to talk and I soon ceased my efforts When the meal was finished he finally began to speak Youve never heard his voice so its hard for me to make you understand what it was like His words were entrancing like a snake whispering gilded lies into my ears A more convincing and frightening man Ive never heard He wove a vision a fantasy of the Empire as he imagined it There would be beautiful cities built across the country filled with the greatest warriors artisans musicians and philosophers The Urgals would finally be eradicated And the Empire would expand in every direction until it reached the four corners of Alagaësia Peace and prosperity would flourish but more wondrous yet the Riders would be brought back to gently govern over Galbatorixs fiefdoms Entranced I listened to him for what must have been hours When he stopped I eagerly asked how the Riders would be reinstated for everyone knew there were no dragon eggs left Galbatorix grew still then and stared at me thoughtfully For a long time he was silent but then he extended his hand and asked Will you O son of my friend serve me as I labor to bring about this paradise Though I knew the history behind his and my fathers rise to power the dream he had painted for me was too compelling too seductive to ignore Ardor for this mission filled me and I fervently pledged myself to him Obviously pleased Galbatorix gave me his blessing then dismissed me saying I shall call upon you when the need arises Several months passed before he did When the summons came I felt all of my old excitement return We met in private as before but this time he was not pleasant or charming The Varden had just destroyed three brigades in the south and his wrath was out in full force He charged me in a terrible voice to take a detachment of troops and destroy Cantos where rebels were known to hide occasionally When I asked what we should do with the people there and how we would know if they were guilty he shouted Theyre all traitors Burn them at the stake and bury their ashes with dung He continued to rant cursing his enemies and describing how he would scourge the land of everyone who bore him ill will His tone was so different from what I had encountered before it made me realize he didnt possess the mercy or foresight to gain the peoples loyalty and he ruled only through brute force guided by his own passions It was at that moment I determined to escape him and Urûbaen forever As soon as I was free of his presence I and my faithful servant Tornac made ready for flight We left that very night but somehow Galbatorix anticipated my actions for there were soldiers waiting for us outside the gates Ah my sword was bloody flashing in the dim lantern glow We defeated the men but in the process Tornac was killed Alone and filled with grief I fled to an old friend who sheltered me in his estate While I hid I listened carefully to every rumor trying to predict Galbatorixs actions and plan my future During that time talk reached me that the Razac had been sent to capture or kill someone Remembering the kings plans for the Riders I decided to find and follow the Razac just in case theydid discover a dragon And thats how I found you I have no more secrets We still dont know if hes telling the truthwarned Saphira I knowsaid Eragonbut why would he lie to us He might be mad I doubt itEragon ran a finger over Saphiras hard scales watching the light reflect off them So why dont you join the Varden Theyll distrust you for a time but once you prove your loyalty theyll treat you with respect And arent they in a sense your allies They strive to end the kings reign Isnt that what you want Must I spell everything out for you demanded Murtagh I dont want Galbatorix to learn where I am which is inevitable if people start saying that Ive sided with his enemies which Ive never done These he paused then said with distaste rebelsare trying not only to overthrow the king but to destroy the Empire and I dont want that to happen It would sow mayhem and anarchy The king is flawed yes but the system itself is sound As for earning the Vardens respect Ha Once I am exposed theyll treat me like a criminal or worse Not only that suspicion will fall upon you because we traveled together Hes rightsaid Saphira Eragon ignored her It isnt that bad he said trying to sound optimistic Murtagh snorted derisively and looked away Im sure that they wont be His words were cut short as the door opened a hands breadth and two bowls were pushed through the space A loaf of bread and a hunk of raw meat followed then the door was shut again Finally grumbled Murtagh going to the food He tossed the meat to Saphira who snapped it out of the air and swallowed it whole Then he tore the loaf in two gave half to Eragon picked up his bowl and retreated to a corner They ate silently Murtagh jabbed at his food Im going to sleep he announced putting down his bowl without another word Good night said Eragon He lay next to Saphira his arms under his head She curled her long neck around him like a cat wrapping its tail around itself and laid her head alongside his One of her wings extended over him like a blue tent enveloping him in darkness Good night little one A small smile lifted Eragons lips but he was already asleep T HEGLORYOFTRONJHEIM Eragon jolted upright as a growl sounded in his ear Saphira was still asleep her eyes wandering sightlessly under her eyelids and her upper lip trembled as if she were going to snarl He smiled then jerked as she growled again She must be dreaminghe realized He watched her for a minute then carefully slid out from under her wing He stood and stretched The room was cool but not unpleasantly so Murtagh lay on his back in the far corner his eyes closed As Eragon stepped around Saphira Murtagh stirred Morning he said quietly sitting up How long have you been awake asked Eragon in a hushed voice Awhile Im surprised Saphira didnt wake you sooner I was tired enough to sleep through a thunderstorm said Eragon wryly He sat by Murtagh and rested his head against the wall Do you know what time it is No Its impossible to tell in here Has anyone come to see us Not yet They sat together without moving or speaking Eragon felt oddly bound to MurtaghIve been carrying his fathers sword which would have been his his inheritance Were alike in many ways yet our outlook and upbringing are totally different He thought of Murtaghs scar and shiveredWhat man could do that to a child Saphira lifted her head and blinked to clear her eyes She sniffed the air then yawned expansively her rough tongue curling at the tipHas anything happened Eragon shook his headI hope they give me more food than that snack last night Im hungry enough to eat a herd of cows Theyll feed youhe assured her Theyd betterShe positioned herself near the door and settled down to wait tail flicking Eragon closed his eyes enjoying the rest He dozed awhile then got up and paced around Bored he examined one of the lanterns It was made of a single piece of teardropshaped glass about twice the size of a lemon and filled with soft blue light that neither wavered nor flickered Four slim metal ribs wrapped smoothly around the glass meeting at the top to form a small hook and again at the bottom where they melded together into three graceful legs The whole piece was quite attractive Eragons inspection was interrupted by voices outside the room The door opened and a dozen warriors marched inside The first man gulped when he saw Saphira They were followed by Orik and the bald man who declared You have been summoned to Ajihad leader of the Varden If you must eat do so while we march Eragon and Murtagh stood together watching him warily Where are our horses And can I have my sword and bow back asked Eragon The bald man looked at him with disdain Your weapons will be returned to you when Ajihad sees fit not before As for your horses they await you in the tunnel Now come As he turned to leave Eragon asked quickly How is Arya The bald man hesitated I do not know The healers are still with her He exited the room accompanied by Orik One of the warriors motioned You go first Eragon went through the doorway followed by Saphira and Murtagh They returned through the corridor they had traversed the night before passing the statue of the quilled animal When they reached the huge tunnel through which they had first entered the mountain the bald man was waiting with Orik who held Tornacs and Snowfires reins You will ride single file down the center of the tunnel instructed the bald man If you attempt to go anywhere else you will be stopped When Eragon started to climb onto Saphira the bald man shouted No Ride your horse until I tell you otherwise Eragon shrugged and took Snowfires reins He swung into the saddle guided Snowfire in front of Saphira and told herStay close in case I need your help Of courseshe said Murtagh mounted Tornac behind Saphira The bald man examined their small line then gestured at the warriors who divided in half to surround them giving Saphira as wide a berth as possible Orik and the bald man went to the head of the procession After looking them over once more the bald man clapped twice and started walking forward Eragon tapped Snowfire lightly on his flanks The entire group headed toward the heart of the mountain Echoes filled the tunnel as the horses hooves struck the hard floor the sounds amplified in the deserted passageway Doors and gates occasionally disturbed the smooth walls but they were always closed Eragon marveled at the sheer size of the tunnel which had been mined with incredible skillthe walls floor and ceiling were crafted with flawless precision The angles at the bases of the walls were perfectly square and as far as he could tell the tunnel itself did not vary from its course by even an inch As they proceeded Eragons anticipation about meeting Ajihad increased The leader of the Varden was a shadowy figure to the people within the Empire He had risen to power nearly twenty years ago and since then had waged a fierce war against King Galbatorix No one knew where he came from or even what he looked like It was rumored that he was a master strategist a brutal fighter With such a reputation Eragon worried about how they would be received Still knowing that Brom had trusted the Varden enough to serve them helped to allay his fears Seeing Orik again had brought forth new questions in his mind The tunnel was obviously dwarf workno one else could mine with such skillbut were the dwarves part of the Varden or were they merely sheltering them And who was the king that Orik had mentioned Was it Ajihad Eragon understood now that the Varden had been able to escape discovery by hiding underground but what about the elves Where were they For nearly an hour the bald man led them through the tunnel never straying nor turningWeve probably already gone a league Eragon realizedMaybe theyre taking us all the way through the mountain At last a soft white glow became visible ahead of them He strained his eyes trying to discern its source but it was still too far away to make out any details The glow increased in strength as they neared it Now he could see thick marble pillars laced with rubies and amethysts standing in rows along the walls Scores of lanterns hung between the pillars suffusing the air with liquid brilliance Gold tracery gleamed from the pillars bases like molten thread Arching over the ceiling were carved raven heads their beaks open in midscreech At the end of the hallway rested two colossal black doors accented by shimmering silver lines that depicted a sevenpointed crown that spanned both sides The bald man stopped and raised a hand He turned to Eragon You will ride upon your dragon now Do not attempt to fly away There will be people watching so remember who and what you are Eragon dismounted Snowfire and then clambered onto Saphiras backI think they want to show us off she said as he settled into the saddle Well see I wish I had Zarroche replied tightening the straps around his legs It might be better that you arent wearing Morzans sword when the Varden first see you TrueIm ready Eragon said squaring his shoulders Good said the bald man He and Orik retreated to either side of Saphira staying far enough back so she was clearly in the lead Now walk to the doors and once they open follow the path Go slowly Readyasked Eragon Of courseSaphira approached the doors at a measured pace Her scales sparkled in the light sending glints of color dancing over the pillars Eragon took a deep breath to steady his nerves Without warning the doors swung outward on hidden joints As the rift widened between them rays of sunlight streamed into the tunnel falling on Saphira and Eragon Temporarily blinded Eragon blinked and squinted When his eyes adjusted to the light he gasped They were inside a massive volcanic crater Its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high above that Eragon could not judge the distanceit might have been more than a dozen miles A soft beam of light fell through the aperture illuminating the craters center though it left the rest of the cavernous expanse in hushed twilight The craters far side hazy blue in the distance looked to be nearly ten miles away Giant icicles hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long hung leagues above them like glistening daggers Eragon knew from his experience in the valley that no one not even Saphira could reach those lofty points Farther down the craters inner walls dark mats of moss and lichen covered the rock He lowered his gaze and saw a wide cobblestone path extending from the doors threshold The path ran straight to the center of the crater where it ended at the base of a snowywhite mountain that glittered like an uncut gem with thousands of colored lights It was less than a tenth of the height of the crater that loomed over and around it but its diminutive appearance was deceiving for it was slightly higher than a mile Long as it was the tunnel had only taken them through one side of the crater wall As Eragon stared he heard Orik say deeply Look well human for no Rider has set eyes upon this for nigh over a hundred years The airy peak under which we stand is Farthen Dûrdiscovered thousands of years ago by the father of our race Korgan while he tunneled for gold And in the center stands our greatest achievement Tronjheim the citymountain built from the purest marble The doors grated to a halt A city Then Eragon saw the crowd He had been so engrossed by the sights that he had failed to notice a dense sea of people clustered around the tunnels entrance They lined the cobblestone pathwaydwarves and humans packed together like trees in a thicket There were hundreds thousands of them Every eye every face was focused on Eragon And every one of them was silent Eragon gripped the base of one of Saphiras neck spikes He saw children in dirty smocks hardy men with scarred knuckles women in homespun dresses and stout weathered dwarves who fingered their beards All of them bore the same taut expressionthat of an injured animal when a predator is nearby and escape is impossible A bead of sweat rolled down Eragons face but he dared not move to wipe it awayWhat should I do he asked frantically Smile raise your hand anythingreplied Saphira sharply Eragon tried to force out a smile but his lips only twitched Gathering his courage he pushed a hand into the air jerking it in a little wave When nothing happened he flushed with embarrassment lowered his arm and ducked his head A single cheer broke the silence Someone clapped loudly For a brief second the crowd hesitated then a wild roar swept through it and a wave of sound crashed over Eragon Very good said the bald man from behind him Now start walking Relieved Eragon sat straighter and playfully asked SaphiraShall we go She arched her neck and stepped forward As they passed the first row of people she glanced to each side and exhaled a puff of smoke The crowd quieted and shrank back then resumed cheering their enthusiasm only intensified Showoffchided Eragon Saphira flicked her tail and ignored him He stared curiously at the jostling crowd as she proceeded along the path Dwarves greatly outnumbered humans and many of them glared at him resentfully Some even turned their backs and walked away with stony faces The humans were hard tough people All the men had daggers or knives at their waists many were armed for war The women carried themselves proudly but they seemed to conceal a deepabiding weariness The few children and babies stared at Eragon with large eyes He felt certain that these people had experienced much hardship and that they would do whatever was necessary to defend themselves The Varden had found the perfect hiding place Farthen Dûrs walls were too high for a dragon to fly over and no army could break through the entranceway even if it managed to find the hidden doors The crowd followed close behind them giving Saphira plenty of room Gradually the people quieted though their attention remained on Eragon He looked back and saw Murtagh riding stiffly his face pale They neared the citymountain and Eragon saw that the white marble of Tronjheim was highly polished and shaped into flowing contours as if it had been poured into place It was dotted with countless round windows framed by elaborate carvings A colored lantern hung in each window casting a soft glow on the surrounding rock No turrets or smokestacks were visible Directly ahead two thirtyfoothigh gold griffins guarded a massive timber gaterecessed twenty yards into the base of Tronjheimwhich was shadowed by thick trusses that supported an arched vault far overhead When they reached Tronjheims base Saphira paused to see if the bald man had any instructions When none were forthcoming she continued to the gate The walls were lined with fluted pillars of bloodred jasper Between the pillars hulked statues of outlandish creatures captured forever by the sculptors chisel The heavy gate rumbled open before them as hidden chains slowly raised the mammoth beams A fourstoryhigh passageway extended straight toward the center of Tronjheim The top three levels were pierced by rows of archways that revealed gray tunnels curving off into the distance Clumps of people filled the arches eagerly watching Eragon and Saphira On ground level however the archways were barred by stout doors Rich tapestries hung between the different levels embroidered with heroic figures and tumultuous battle scenes A cheer rang in their ears as Saphira stepped into the hall and paraded down it Eragon raised his hand eliciting another roar from the throng though many of the dwarves did not join the welcoming shout The milelong hall ended in an arch flanked by black onyx pillars Yellow zircons three times the size of a man capped the dark columns coruscating piercing gold beams along the hall Saphira stepped through the opening then stopped and craned back her neck humming deeply in her chest They were in a circular room perhaps a thousand feet across that reached up to Tronjheims peak a mile overhead narrowing as it rose The walls were lined with archesone row for each level of the citymountainand the floor was made of polished carnelian upon which was etched a hammer girdled by twelve silver pentacles like on Oriks helm The room was a nexus for four hallwaysincluding the one they had just exitedthat divided Tronjheim into quarters The halls were identical except for the one opposite Eragon To the right and left of that hall were tall arches that opened to descending stairs which mirrored each other as they curved underground The ceiling was capped by a dawnred star sapphire of monstrous size The jewel was twenty yards across and nearly as thick Its face had been carved to resemble a rose in full bloom and so skilled was the craftsmanship the flower almost seemed to be real A wide belt of lanterns wrapped around the edge of the sapphire which cast striated bands of blushing light over everything below The flashing rays of the star within the gem made it appear as if a giant eye gazed down at them Eragon could only gape with wonder Nothing had prepared him for this It seemed impossible that Tronjheim had been built by mortal beings The citymountain shamed everything he had seen in the Empire He doubted if even Urûbaen could match the wealth and grandeur displayed here Tronjheim was a stunning monument to the dwarves power and perseverance The bald man walked in front of Saphira and said You must go on foot from here There was scattered booing from the crowd as he spoke A dwarf took Tornac and Snowfire away Eragon dismounted Saphira but stayed by her side as the bald man led them across the carnelian floor to the righthand hallway They followed it for several hundred feet then entered a smaller corridor Their guards remained despite the cramped space After four sharp turns they came to a massive cedar door stained black with age The bald man pulled it open and conducted everyone but the guards inside A JIHAD Eragon entered an elegant twostory study paneled with rows of cedar bookshelves A wroughtiron staircase wound up to a small balcony with two chairs and a reading table White lanterns hung along the walls and ceiling so a book could be read anywhere in the room The stone floor was covered by an intricate oval rug At the far end of the room a man stood behind a large walnut desk His skin gleamed the color of oiled ebony The dome of his head was shaved bare but a closely trimmed black beard covered his chin and upper lip Strong features shadowed his face and grave intelligent eyes lurked under his brow His shoulders were broad and powerful emphasized by a tapered red vest embroidered with gold thread and clasped over a rich purple shirt He bore himself with great dignity exuding an intense commanding air When he spoke his voice was strong confident Welcome to Tronjheim Eragon and Saphira I am Ajihad Please seat yourselves Eragon slipped into an armchair next to Murtagh while Saphira settled protectively behind them Ajihad raised his hand and snapped his fingers A man stepped out from behind the staircase He was identical to the bald man beside him Eragon stared at the two of them with surprise and Murtagh stiffened Your confusion is understandable they are twin brothers said Ajihad with a small smile I would tell you their names but they have none Saphira hissed with distaste Ajihad watched her for a moment then sat in a highbacked chair behind the desk The Twins retreated under the stairs and stood impassively beside each other Ajihad pressed his fingers together as he stared at Eragon and Murtagh He studied them for a long time with an unwavering gaze Eragon squirmed uncomfortable After what seemed like several minutes Ajihad lowered his hands and beckoned to the Twins One of them hurried to his side Ajihad whispered in his ear The bald man suddenly paled and shook his head vigorously Ajihad frowned then nodded as if something had been confirmed He looked at Murtagh You have placed me in a difficult position by refusing to be examined You have been allowed into Farthen Dûr because the Twins have assured me that they can control you and because of your actions on behalf of Eragon and Arya I understand that there may be things you wish to keep hidden in your mind but as long as you do we can not trust you You wouldnt trust me anyway said Murtagh defiantly Ajihads face darkened as Murtagh spoke and his eyes flashed dangerously Though its been twenty and three years since it last broke upon my ear I know that voice He stood ominously chest swelling The Twins looked alarmed and put their heads together whispering frantically It came from another man one more beast than human Get up Murtagh warily complied his eyes darting between the Twins and Ajihad Remove your shirt ordered Ajihad With a shrug Murtagh pulled off his tunic Now turn around As he pivoted to the side light fell upon the scar on his back Murtagh breathed Ajihad A grunt of surprise came from Orik Without warning Ajihad turned on the Twins and thundered Did you know of this The Twins bowed their heads We discovered his name in Eragons mind but we did not suspect that thisboy was the son of one as powerful as Morzan It never occurred And you didnt tell me demanded Ajihad He raised a hand forestalling their explanation We will discuss it later He faced Murtagh again First I must untangle this muddle Do you still refuse to be probed Yes said Murtagh sharply slipping back into his tunic I wont let anyone inside my head Ajihad leaned on his desk There will be unpleasant consequences if you dont Unless the Twins can certify that you arent a threat we can not give you credence despite and perhaps because of the assistance you have given Eragon Without that verification the people here dwarf and human alike will tear you apart if they learn of your presence Ill be forced to keep you confined at all timesas much for your protection as for ours It will only get worse once the dwarf king Hrothgar demands custody of you Dont force yourself into that situation when it can easily be avoided Murtagh shook his head stubbornly No even if I were to submit I would still be treated like a leper and an outcast All I wish is to leave If you let me do that peacefully Ill never reveal your location to the Empire What will happen if you are captured and brought before Galbatorix demanded Ajihad He will extract every secret from your mind no matter how strong you may be Even if you could resist him how can we trust that you wont rejoin him in the future I can not take that chance Will you hold me prisoner forever demanded Murtagh straightening No said Ajihad only until you let yourself be examined If you are found trustworthy the Twins will remove all knowledge of Farthen Dûrs location from your mind before you leave We wont risk someone with those memories falling into Galbatorixs hands What is it to be Murtagh Decide quickly or else the path will be chosen for you Just give inEragon pleaded silently concerned for Murtaghs safetyIts not worth the fight Finally Murtagh spoke the words slow and distinct My mind is the one sanctuary that has not been stolen from me Men have tried to breach it before but Ive learned to defend it vigorously for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts You have asked for the one thing I can not give least of all to those two He gestured at the Twins Do with me what you will but know this death will take me before Ill expose myself to their probing Admiration glinted in Ajihads eyes Im not surprised by your choice though I had hoped otherwise Guards The cedar door slammed open as warriors rushed in weapons ready Ajihad pointed at Murtagh and commanded Take him to a windowless room and bar the door securely Post six men by the entrance and allow no one inside until I come to see him Do not speak to him either The warriors surrounded Murtagh watching him suspiciously As they left the study Eragon caught Murtaghs attention and mouthed Im sorry Murtagh shrugged then stared forward resolutely He vanished into the hallway with the men The sound of their feet faded into silence Ajihad said abruptly I want everyone out of this room but Eragon and Saphira Now Bowing the Twins departed but Orik said Sir the king will want to know of Murtagh And there is still the matter of my insubordination Ajihad frowned then waved his hand I will tell Hrothgar myself As for your actions wait outside until I call for you And dont let the Twins get away Im not done with them either Very well said Orik inclining his head He closed the door with a solid thump After a long silence Ajihad sat with a tired sigh He ran a hand over his face and stared at the ceiling Eragon waited impatiently for him to speak When nothing was forthcoming he blurted Is Arya all right Ajihad looked down at him and said gravely No but the healers tell me she will recover They worked on her all through the night The poison took a dreadful toll on her She wouldnt have lived if not for you For that you have the Vardens deepest thanks Eragons shoulders slumped with relief For the first time he felt that their flight from Gilead had been worth the effort So what now he asked I need you to tell me how you found Saphira and everything thats happened since said Ajihad forming a steeple with his fingers Some of it I know from the message Brom sent us other parts from the Twins But I want to hear it from you especially the details concerning Broms death Eragon was reluctant to share his experiences with a stranger but Ajihad was patientGo on urged Saphira gently Eragon shifted then began his story It was awkward at first but grew easier as he proceeded Saphira helped him to remember things clearly with occasional comments Ajihad listened intently the entire time Eragon talked for hours often pausing between his words He told Ajihad of Teirm though he kept Angelas fortunetelling to himself and how he and Brom had found the Razac He even related his dreams of Arya When he came to Gilead and mentioned the Shade Ajihads face hardened and he leaned back with veiled eyes When his narrative was complete Eragon fell silent brooding on all that had occurred Ajihad stood clasped his hands behind his back and absently studied one of the bookshelves After a time he returned to the desk Broms death is a terrible loss He was a close friend of mine and a powerful ally of the Varden He saved us from destruction many times through his bravery and intelligence Even now when he is gone hes provided us with the one thing that can ensure our successyou But what can you expect me to accomplish asked Eragon I will explain it in full said Ajihad but there are more urgent matters to be dealt with first The news of the Urgals alliance with the Empire is extremely serious If Galbatorix is gathering an Urgal army to destroy us the Varden will be hard pressed to survive even though many of us are protected here in Farthen Dûr That a Rider even one as evil as Galbatorix would consider a pact with such monsters is indeed proof of madness I shudder to think of what he promised them in return for their fickle loyalty And then there is the Shade Can you describe him Eragon nodded He was tall thin and very pale with red eyes and hair He was dressed all in black What of his sworddid you see it asked Ajihad intensely Did it have a long scratch on the blade Yes said Eragon surprised How did you know Because I put it there while trying to cut out his heart said Ajihad with a grim smile His name is Durzaone of the most vicious and cunning fiends to ever stalk this land He is the perfect servant for Galbatorix and a dangerous enemy for us You say that you killed him How was it done Eragon remembered it vividly Murtagh shot him twice The first arrow caught him in the shoulder the second one struck him between the eyes I was afraid of that said Ajihad frowning You didnt kill him Shades can only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart Anything short of that will cause them to vanish and then reappear elsewhere in spirit form Its an unpleasant process but Durza will survive and return stronger than ever A moody silence settled over them like a foreboding thunderhead Then Ajihad stated You are an enigma Eragon a quandary that no one knows how to solve Everyone knows what the Varden wantor the Urgals or even Galbatorixbut no one knows whatyou want And that makes you dangerous especially to Galbatorix He fears you because he doesnt know what you will do next Do the Varden fear me asked Eragon quietly No said Ajihad carefully We are hopeful But if that hope proves false then yes we will be afraid Eragon looked down You must understand the unusual nature of your position There are factions who want you to serve their interests and no one elses The moment you entered Farthen Dûr their influence and power began tugging on you Including yours asked Eragon Ajihad chuckled though his eyes were sharp Including mine There are certain things you should know first is how Saphiras egg happened to appear in the Spine Did Brom ever tell you what was done with her egg after he brought it here No said Eragon glancing at Saphira She blinked and flicked her tongue at him Ajihad tapped his desk before beginning When Brom first brought the egg to the Varden everyone was deeply interested in its fate We had thought the dragons were exterminated The dwarves were solely concerned with making sure that the future Rider would be an allythough some of them were opposed to having a new Rider at allwhile the elves and Varden had a more personal stake in the matter The reason was simple enough throughout history all the Riders have been either elven or human with the majority being elven There has never been a dwarf Rider Because of Galbatorixs betrayals the elves were reluctant to let any of the Varden handle the egg for fear that the dragon inside would hatch for a human with similar instabilities It was a challenging situation as both sides wanted the Rider for their own The dwarves only aggravated the problem by arguing obstinately with both the elves and us whenever they had the chance Tensions escalated and before long threats were made that were later regretted It was then that Brom suggested a compromise that allowed all sides to save face He proposed that the egg be ferried between the Varden and the elves every year At each place children would parade past it and then the bearers of the egg would wait to see if the dragon would hatch If it didnt they would leave and return to the other group But if the dragondid hatch the new Riders training would be undertaken immediately For the first year or so he or she would be instructed here by Brom Then the Rider would be taken to the elves who would finish the education The elves reluctantly accepted this plan with the stipulation that if Brom were to die before the dragon hatched they would be free to train the new Rider without interference The agreement was slanted in their favorwe both knew that the dragon would likely chose an elfbut it provided a desperately needed semblance of equality Ajihad paused his rich eyes somber Shadows bit into his face under his cheekbones making them jut out It was hoped that this new Rider would bring our two races closer together We waited for well over a decade but the egg never hatched The matter passed from our minds and we rarely thought about it except to lament the eggs inactivity Then last year we suffered a terrible loss Arya and the egg disappeared on her return from Tronjheim to the elven city Osilon The elves were the first to discover she was missing They found her steed and guards slain in Du Weldenvarden and a group of slaughtered Urgals nearby But neither Arya nor the egg was there When this news reached me I feared that Urgals had both of them and would soon learn the location of Farthen Dûr and the elves capital Ellesméra where their queen Islanzadi lives Now I understand they were working for the Empire which is far worse We wont know exactly what occurred during that attack until Arya wakes but I have deduced a few details from what youve said Ajihads vest rustled as he leaned his elbows on the desk The attack must have been swift and decisive else Arya would have escaped Without any warning and deprived of a place to hide she could have done only one thingused magic to transport the egg elsewhere She can use magic asked Eragon Arya had mentioned that she had been given a drug to suppress her power he wanted to confirm that she meant magic He wondered if she could teach him more words of the ancient language It was one of the reasons why she was chosen to guard the egg Anyway Arya couldnt have returned it to usshe was too far awayand the elves realm is warded by arcane barriers that prevent anything from entering their borders through magical means She must have thought of Brom and in desperation sent the egg toward Carvahall Without time to prepare Im not surprised she missed by the margin she did The Twins tell me it is an imprecise art Why was she closer to Palancar Valley than the Varden asked Eragon Where do the elves really live Where is this Ellesméra Ajihads keen gaze bored into Eragon as he considered the question I dont tell you this lightly for the elves guard the knowledge jealously But you should know and I do this as a display of trust Their cities lie far to the north in the deepest reaches of the endless forest Du Weldenvarden Not since the Riders time has anyone dwarf or human been elffriend enough to walk in their leafy halls I do not even know how to find Ellesméra As for Osilon based on where Arya disappeared I suspect it is near Du Weldenvardens western edge toward Carvahall You must have many other questions but bear with me and keep them until I have finished He gathered his memories then spoke at a quickened pace When Arya disappeared the elves withdrew their support from the Varden Queen Islanzadi was especially enraged and refused any further contact with us As a result even though I received Broms message the elves are still ignorant of you and Saphira Without their supplies to sustain my troops we have fared badly these past months in skirmishes with the Empire With Aryas return and your arrival I expect the queens hostility will abate The fact that you rescued Arya will greatly help our case with her Your training however is going to present a problem for both Varden and elves Brom obviously had a chance to teach you but we need to know how thorough he was For that reason youll have to be tested to determine the extent of your abilities Also the elves will expect you to finish your training with them though Im not sure if theres time for that Why not asked Eragon For several reasons Chief among them the tidings you brought about the Urgals said Ajihad his eyes straying to Saphira You see Eragon the Varden are in an extremely delicate position On one hand we have to comply with the elves wishes if we want to keep them as allies At the same time we can not anger the dwarves if we wish to lodge in Tronjheim Arent the dwarves part of the Varden asked Eragon Ajihad hesitated In a sense yes They allow us to live here and provide assistance in our struggle against the Empire but they are loyal only to their king I have no power over them except for what Hrothgar gives me and even he often has trouble with the dwarf clans The thirteen clans are subservient to Hrothgar but each clan chief wields enormous power they choose the new dwarf king when the old one dies Hrothgar is sympathetic to our cause but many of the chiefs arent He cant afford to anger them unnecessarily or hell lose the support of his people so his actions on our behalf have been severely circumscribed These clan chiefs said Eragon are they against me as well Even more so Im afraid said Ajihad wearily There has long been enmity between dwarves and dragonsbefore the elves came and made peace dragons made a regular habit of eating the dwarves flocks and stealing their goldand the dwarves are slow to forget past wrongs Indeed they never fully accepted the Riders or allowed them to police their kingdom Galbatorixs rise to power has only served to convince many of them that it would be better never to deal with Riders or dragons ever again He directed his last words at Saphira Eragon said slowly Why doesnt Galbatorix know where Farthen Dûr and Ellesméra are Surely he was told of them when he was instructed by the Riders Told of them yesshown where they are no Its one thing to know that Farthen Dûr lies within these mountains quite another to find it Galbatorix hadnt been taken to either place before his dragon was killed After that of course the Riders didnt trust him He tried to force the information out of several Riders during his rebellion but they chose to die rather than reveal it to him As for the dwarves hes never managed to capture one alive though its only a matter of time Then why doesnt he just take an army and march through Du Weldenvarden until he finds Ellesméra asked Eragon Because the elves still have enough power to resist him said Ajihad He doesnt dare test his strength against theirs at least not yet But his cursed sorcery grows stronger each year With another Rider at his side he would be unstoppable He keeps trying to get one of his two eggs to hatch but so far hes been unsuccessful Eragon was puzzled How can his power be increasing The strength of his body limits his abilitiesit cant build itself up forever We dont know said Ajihad shrugging his broad shoulders and neither do the elves We can only hope that someday he will be destroyed by one of his own spells He reached inside his vest and somberly pulled out a battered piece of parchment Do you know what this is he asked placing it on the desk Eragon bent forward and examined it Lines of black script written in an alien language were inked across the page Large sections of the writing had been destroyed by blots of blood One edge of the parchment was charred He shook his head No I dont It was taken from the leader of the Urgal host we destroyed last night It cost us twelve men to do sothey sacrificed themselves so that you might escape safely The writing is the kings invention a script he uses to communicate with his servants It took me a while but I was able to devise its meaning at least where its legible It reads gatekeeper at Ithrö Zhâda is to let this bearer and his minions pass They are to be bunked with the others of their kind and by but only if the two factions refrain from fighting Command will be given under Tarok under Gashz under Durza under Ushnark the Mighty Ushnark is Galbatorix It means father in the Urgal tongue an affectation that pleases him Find what they are suitable for and The footmen and are to be kept separate No weapons are to be distributed until for marching Nothing else can be read past there except for a few vague words said Ajihad Wheres Ithrö Zhâda Ive never heard of it Nor have I confirmed Ajihad which makes me suspect that Galbatorix has renamed an existing place for his own purposes After deciphering this I asked myself what hundreds of Urgals were doing by the Beor Mountains where you first saw them and where they were going The parchment mentions others of their kind so I assume there are even more Urgals at their destination Theres only one reason for the king to gather such a forceto forge a bastard army of humans and monsters to destroy us For now there is nothing to do but wait and watch Without further information we can not find this Ithrö Zhâda Still Farthen Dûr has not yet been discovered so there is hope The only Urgals to have seen it died last night How did you know we were coming asked Eragon One of the Twins was waiting for us and there was an ambush in place for the Kull He was aware of Saphira listening intently Though she kept her own counsel he knew she would have things to say later We have sentinels placed at the entrance of the valley you traveled throughon either side of the Beartooth River They sent a dove to warn us explained Ajihad Eragon wondered if it was the same bird Saphira had tried to eat When the egg and Arya disappeared did you tell Brom He said that he hadnt heard anything from the Varden We tried to alert him said Ajihad but I suspect our men were intercepted and killed by the Empire Why else would the Razac have gone to Carvahall After that Brom was traveling with you and it was impossible to get word to him I was relieved when he contacted me via messenger from Teirm It didnt surprise me that he went to Jeod they were old friends And Jeod could easily send us a message because he smuggles supplies to us through Surda All of this has raised serious questions How did the Empire know where to ambush Arya and later our messengers to Carvahall How has Galbatorix learned which merchants help the Varden Jeods business has been virtually destroyed since you left him as have those of other merchants who support us Every time one of their ships sets sail it disappears The dwarves can not give us everything we need so the Varden are in desperate need of supplies Im afraid that we have a traitor or traitors in our midst despite our efforts to examine peoples minds for deceit Eragon sank deep in thought pondering what he had learned Ajihad waited calmly for him to speak undisturbed by the silence For the first time since finding Saphiras egg Eragon felt that he understood what was going on around him At last he knew where Saphira came from and what might lie in his future What do you want from me he asked How do you mean I mean what is expected of me in Tronjheim You and the elves have plans for me but what if I dont like them A hard note crept into his voice Ill fight when needed revel when theres occasion mourn when there is grief and die if my time comes but I wont let anyone use me against my will He paused to let the words sink in The Riders of old were arbiters of justice above and beyond the leaders of their time I dont claim that positionI doubt people would accept such oversight when theyve been free of it all their lives especially from one as young as me But Ido have power and I will wield it as I see fit What I want to know is howyou plan to use me Then I will decide whether to agree to it Ajihad looked at him wryly If you were anyone else and were before another leader you would likely have been killed for that insolent speech What makes you think I will expose my plans just because you demand it Eragon flushed but did not lower his gaze Still you are right Your position gives you the privilege to say such things You can not escape the politics of your situationyouwill be influenced one way or another I dont want to see you become a pawn of any one group or purpose any more than you do You must retain your freedom for in it lies your true power the ability to make choices independent of any leader or king My own authority over you will be limited but I believe its for the best The difficulty lies in making sure that those with power include you in their deliberations Also despite your protests the people here have certain expectations of you They are going to bring you their problems no matter how petty and demand that you solve them Ajihad leaned forward his voice deadly serious There will be cases where someones future will rest in your hands with a word you can send them careening into happiness or misery Young women will seek your opinion on whom they should marrymany will pursue you as a husbandand old men will ask which of their children should receive an inheritance Youmust be kind and wise with them all for they put their trust in you Dont speak flippantly or without thought because your words will have impact far beyond what you intend Ajihad leaned back his eyes hooded The burden of leadership is being responsible for the wellbeing of the people in your charge I have dealt with it from the day I was chosen to head the Varden and now you must as well Be careful I wont tolerate injustice under my command Dont worry about your youth and inexperience they will pass soon enough Eragon was uncomfortable with the idea of people asking him for advice But you still havent said what Im to do here For now nothing You covered over a hundred and thirty leagues in eight days a feat to be proud of Im sure that youll appreciate rest When youve recovered we will test your competency in arms and magic After thatwell I will explain your options and then youll have to decide your course And what about Murtagh asked Eragon bitingly Ajihads face darkened He reached beneath his desk and lifted up Zarroc The swords polished sheath gleamed in the light Ajihad slid his hand over it lingering on the etched sigil He will stay here until he allows the Twins into his mind You cant imprison him argued Eragon Hes committed no crime We cant give him his freedom without being sure that he wont turn against us Innocent or not hes potentially as dangerous to us as his father was said Ajihad with a hint of sadness Eragon realized that Ajihad would not be convinced otherwise and his concernwas valid How were you able to recognize his voice I met his father once said Ajihad shortly He tapped Zarrocs hilt I wish Brom had told me he had taken Morzans sword I suggest that you dont carry it within Farthen Dûr Many here remember Morzans time with hate especially the dwarves Ill remember that promised Eragon Ajihad handed Zarroc to him That reminds me I have Broms ring which he sent as confirmation of his identity I was keeping it for when he returned to Tronjheim Now that hes dead I suppose it belongs to you and I think he would have wanted you to have it He opened a desk drawer and took the ring from it Eragon accepted it with reverence The symbol cut into the face of the sapphire was identical to the tattoo on Aryas shoulder He fit the ring onto his index finger admiring how it caught the light I I am honored he said Ajihad nodded gravely then pushed back his chair and stood He faced Saphira and spoke to her his voice swelling in power Do not think that I have forgotten you O mighty dragon I have said these things as much for your benefit as for Eragons It is even more important that you know them for to you falls the task of guarding him in these dangerous times Do not underestimate your might nor falter at his side because without you he will surely fail Saphira lowered her head until their eyes were level and stared at him through slitted black pupils They examined each other silently neither of them blinking Ajihad was the first to move He lowered his eyes and said softly It is indeed a privilege to meet you Hell dosaid Saphira respectfully She swung her head to face Eragon Tell him that I am impressed both with Tronjheim and with him The Empire is right to fear him Let him know however that if he had decided to kill you I would have destroyed Tronjheim and torn him apart with my teeth Eragon hesitated surprised by the venom in her voice then relayed the message Ajihad looked at her seriously I would expect nothing less from one so noblebut I doubt you could have gotten past the Twins Saphira snorted with derisionBah Knowing what she meant Eragon said Then they must be much stronger than they appear I think they would be sorely dismayed if they ever faced a dragons wrath The two of them might be able to defeat me but never Saphira You should know a Riders dragon strengthens his magic beyond what a normal magician might have Brom was always weaker than me because of that I think that in the absence of Riders the Twins have overestimated their power Ajihad looked troubled Brom was considered one of our strongest spell weavers Only the elves surpassed him If what you say is true we will have to reconsider a great many things He bowed to Saphira As it is I am glad it wasnt necessary to harm either of you Saphira dipped her head in return Ajihad straightened with a lordly air and called Orik The dwarf hurried into the room and stood before the desk crossing his arms Ajihad frowned at him irritated Youve caused me a great deal of trouble Orik Ive had to listen to one of the Twins complain all morning about your insubordination They wont let it rest until you are punished Unfortunately theyre right Its a serious matter that can not be ignored An accounting is due Oriks eyes flicked toward Eragon but his face betrayed no emotion He spoke quickly in rough tones The Kull were almost around Kósthamérna They were shooting arrows at the dragon Eragon and Murtagh but the Twins did nothing to stop it Like sheilven they refused to open the gates even though we could see Eragon shouting the opening phrase on the other side of the waterfall And they refused to take action when Eragon did not rise from the water Perhaps I did wrong but I couldnt let a Rider die I wasnt strong enough to get out of the water myself offered Eragon I would have drowned if he hadnt pulled me out Ajihad glanced at him then asked Orik seriously And later why did you oppose them Orik raised his chin defiantly It wasnt right for them to force their way into Murtaghs mind But I wouldnt have stopped them if Id known who he was No you did the right thing though it would be simpler if you hadnt It isnt our place to force our way into peoples minds no matter who they are Ajihad fingered his dense beard Your actions were honorable but you did defy a direct order from your commander The penalty for that has always been death Oriks back stiffened You cant kill him for that He was only helping me cried Eragon It isnt your place to interfere said Ajihad sternly Orik broke the law and must suffer the consequences Eragon started to argue again but Ajihad stopped him with a raised hand But you are right The sentence will be mitigated because of the circumstances As of now Orik you are removed from active service and forbidden to engage in any military activities under my command Do you understand Oriks face darkened but then he only looked confused He nodded sharply Yes Furthermore in the absence of your regular duties I appoint you Eragon and Saphiras guide for the duration of their stay You are to make sure they receive every comfort and amenity we have to offer Saphira will stay above Isidar Mithrim Eragon may have quarters wherever he wants When he recovers from his trip take him to the training fields Theyre expecting him said Ajihad a twinkle of amusement in his eye Orik bowed low I understand Very well you all may go Send in the Twins as you leave Eragon bowed and began to leave then asked Where can I find Arya I would like to see her No one is allowed to visit her You will have to wait until she comes to you Ajihad looked down at his desk in a clear dismissal B LESS THECHILDARGETLAM Eragon stretched in the hall he was stiff from sitting so long Behind him the Twins entered Ajihads study and closed the door Eragon looked at Orik Im sorry that youre in trouble because of me he apologized Dont bother yourself grunted Orik tugging on his beard Ajihad gave me what I wanted Even Saphira was startled by the statement What do you mean said Eragon You cant train or fight and youre stuck guarding me How can that be what you wanted The dwarf eyed him quietly Ajihad is a good leader He understands how to keep the law yet remain just I have been punished by his command but Im also one of Hrothgars subjects Under his rule Im still free to do what I wish Eragon realized it would be unwise to forget Oriks dual loyalty and the split nature of power within Tronjheim Ajihad just placed you in a powerful position didnt he Orik chuckled deeply That he did and in such a way the Twins cant complain about it Thisll irritate them for sure Ajihads a tricky one he is Come lad Im sure youre hungry And we have to get your dragon settled in Saphira hissed Eragon said Her name is Saphira Orik made a small bow to her My apologies Ill be sure to remember that He took an orange lamp from the wall and led them down the hallway Can others in Farthen Dûr use magic asked Eragon struggling to keep up with the dwarfs brisk pace He cradled Zarroc carefully concealing the symbol on the sheath with his arm Few enough said Orik with a swift shrug under his mail And the ones we have cant do much more than heal bruises Theyve all had to tend to Arya because of the strength needed to heal her Except for the Twins Oeí grumbled Orik She wouldnt want their help anyway their arts are not for healing Their talents lie in scheming and plotting for powerto everyone elses detriment Deynor Ajihads predecessor allowed them to join the Varden because he needed their support you cant oppose the Empire without spellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle Theyre a nasty pair but they do have their uses They entered one of the four main tunnels that divided Tronjheim Clusters of dwarves and humans strolled through it voices echoing loudly off the polished floor The conversations stopped abruptly as they saw Saphira scores of eyes fixed on her Orik ignored the spectators and turned left heading toward one of Tronjheims distant gates Where are we going asked Eragon Out of these halls so Saphira can fly to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim the Star Rose The dragonhold doesnt have a roofTronjheims peak is open to the sky like that of Farthen Dûrso she that is you Saphira will be able to glide straight down into the hold It is where the Riders used to stay when they visited Tronjheim Wont it be cold and damp without a roof asked Eragon Nay Orik shook his head Farthen Dûr protects us from the elements Neither rain nor snow intrude here Besides the holds walls are lined with marble caves for dragons They provide all the shelter necessary All you need fear are the icicles when they fall theyve been known to cleave a horse in two I will be fineassured SaphiraA marble cave is safer than any of the other places weve stayed Perhaps Do you think Murtagh will be all right Ajihad strikes me as an honorable man Unless Murtagh tries to escape I doubt he will be harmed Eragon crossed his arms unwilling to talk further He was dazed by the change in circumstances from the day before Their mad race from Gilead was finally over but his body expected to continue running and riding Where are our horses In the stables by the gate We can visit them before leaving Tronjheim They exited Tronjheim through the same gate they had entered The gold griffins gleamed with colored highlights garnered from scores of lanterns The sun had moved during Eragons talk with Ajihadlight no longer entered Farthen Dûr through the crater opening Without those moted rays the inside of the hollow mountain was velvety black The only illumination came from Tronjheim which sparkled brilliantly in the gloom The citymountains radiance was enough to brighten the ground hundreds of feet away Orik pointed at Tronjheims white pinnacle Fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there he told Saphira You may stay in any of the caves Once you make your choice bedding will be laid down in it and then no one will disturb you I thought we were going to go together I dont want to be separated protested Eragon Orik turned to him Rider Eragon I will do everything to accommodate you but it would be best if Saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat The tunnels to the banquet halls arent large enough for her to accompany us Why cant you just bring me food in the hold Because said Orik with a guarded expression the food is prepared down here and it is a long way to the top If you wish a servant could be sent up to the hold with a meal for you It will take some time but you could eat with Saphira then He actually means itEragon thought astonished that they would do so much for him But the way Orik said it made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow Im wearysaid SaphiraAnd this dragonhold sounds to my liking Go have your meal then come to me It will be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers We have suffered the hardships of the trail too long Eragon looked at her thoughtfully then said to Orik Ill eat down here The dwarf smiled seeming satisfied Eragon unstrapped Saphiras saddle so she could lie down without discomfortWould you take Zarroc with you Yesshe said gathering up the sword and saddle with her clawsBut keep your bow We must trust these people though not to the point of foolishness I knowhe said disquieted With an explosive leap Saphira swept off the ground and into the still air The steady whoosh of her wings was the only sound in the darkness As she disappeared over the rim of Tronjheims peak Orik let out a long breath Ah boy you have been blessed indeed I find a sudden longing in my heart for open skies and soaring cliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk Still my feet are better on the groundpreferably under it He clapped his hands loudly I neglect my duties as host I know youve not dined since that pitiful dinner the Twins saw fit to give you so come lets find the cooks and beg meat and bread from them Eragon followed the dwarf back into Tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they came to a long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for dwarves Fires blazed in soapstone ovens behind a long counter Orik spoke words in an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddyfaced dwarf who promptly handed them stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish Then Orik took Eragon up several flights of stairs and into a small alcove carved out of Tronjheims outer wall where they sat crosslegged Eragon wordlessly reached for his food When their platters were empty Orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a longstemmed pipe He lit it saying A worthy repast though it needed a good draught of mead to wash it down properly Eragon surveyed the ground below Do you farm in Farthen Dûr No theres only enough sunlight for moss mushrooms and mold Tronjheim can not survive without supplies from the surrounding valleys which is one reason why many of us choose to live elsewhere in the Beor Mountains Then there are other dwarf cities Not as many as we would like And Tronjheim is the greatest of them Leaning on an elbow Orik took a deep pull on his pipe You have only seen the lower levels so it hasnt been apparent but most of Tronjheim is deserted The farther up you go the emptier it gets Entire floors have remained untouched for centuries Most dwarves prefer to dwell under Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr in the caverns and passageways that riddle the rock Through the centuries we have tunneled extensively under the Beor Mountains It is possible to walk from one end of the mountain range to the other without ever setting foot on the surface It seems like a waste to have all that unused space in Tronjheim commented Eragon Orik nodded Some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our resources but Tronjheim does perform one invaluable task Whats that In times of misfortune it can house our entire nation There have been only three instances in our history when we have been forced to that extreme but each time it has saved us from certain and utter destruction That is why we always keep it garrisoned ready for use Ive never seen anything as magnificent admitted Eragon Orik smiled around his pipe Im glad you find it so It took generations to build Tronjheimand our lives are much longer than those of men Unfortunately because of the cursed Empire few outsiders are allowed to see its glory How many Varden are here Dwarves or humans HumansI want to know how many have fled the Empire Orik exhaled a long puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head There are about four thousand of your kin here But thats a poor indicator of what you want to know Only people who wish to fight come here The rest of them are under King Orrins protection in Surda So fewthought Eragon with a sinking feeling The royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand when it was fully marshaled not counting the Urgals Why doesnt Orrin fight the Empire himself he asked If he were to show open hostility said Orik Galbatorix would crush him As it is Galbatorix withholds that destruction because he considers Surda a minor threat which is a mistake Its through Orrins assistance that the Varden have most of their weapons and supplies Without him there would be no resisting the Empire Dont despair over the number of humans in Tronjheim There are many dwarves heremany more than you have seenand all will fight when the time comes Orrin has also promised us troops for when we battle Galbatorix The elves pledged their help as well Eragon absently touched Saphiras mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto He noticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on Oriks helm What does that mean I saw it on the floor in Tronjheim Orik lifted the ironbound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving It is the symbol of my clan We are the Ingietum metalworkers and master smiths The hammer and stars are inlaid into Tronjheims floor because it was the personal crest of Korgan our founder One clan to rule with twelve surrounding King Hrothgar is Dûrgrimst Ingietum as well and has brought my house much glory much honor When they returned the platters to the cook they passed a dwarf in the hall He stopped before Eragon bowed and said respectfully Argetlam The dwarf left Eragon fumbling for an answer flushed with unease yet also strangely pleased with the gesture No one had bowed to him before What did he say he asked leaning closer to Orik Orik shrugged embarrassed Its an elven word that was used to refer to the Riders It means silver hand Eragon glanced at his gloved hand thinking of the gedwëy ignasia that whitened his palm Do you wish to return to Saphira Is there somewhere I could bathe first I havent been able to wash off the grime of the road for a long time Also my shirt is bloodstained and torn and it stinks Id like to replace it but I dont have any money to buy a new one Is there a way I could work for one Do you seek to insult Hrothgars hospitality Eragon demanded Orik As long as you are in Tronjheim you wont have to buy a thing Youll pay for it in other waysAjihad and Hrothgar will see to that Come Ill show you where to wash then fetch you a shirt He took Eragon down a long staircase until they were well below Tronjheim The corridors were tunnels nowwhich cramped Eragon because they were only five feet highand all the lanterns were red So the light doesnt blind you when you leave or enter a dark cavern explained Orik They entered a bare room with a small door on the far side Orik pointed The pools are through there along with brushes and soap Leave your clothes here Ill have new ones waiting when you get out Eragon thanked him and started to undress It felt oppressive being alone underground especially with the low rock ceiling He stripped quickly and cold hurried through the door into total darkness He inched forward until his foot touched warm water then eased himself into it The pool was mildly salty but soothing and calm For a moment he was afraid of drifting away from the door into deeper water but as he waded forward he discovered the water reached only to his waist He groped over a slippery wall until he found the soap and brushes then scrubbed himself Afterward he floated with his eyes closed enjoying the warmth When he emerged dripping into the lighted room he found a towel a fine linen shirt and a pair of breeches The clothes fit him reasonably well Satisfied he went out into the tunnel Orik was waiting for him pipe in hand They climbed the stairs back up into Tronjheim then exited the citymountain Eragon gazed at Tronjheims peak and called Saphira with his mind As she flew down from the dragonhold he asked How do you communicate with people at the top of Tronjheim Orik chuckled Thats a problem we solved long ago You didnt notice but behind the open arches that line each level is a single unbroken staircase that spirals around the wall of Tronjheims central chamber The stairs climb all the way to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim We call it Vol Turin The Endless Staircase Running up or down it isnt swift enough for an emergency nor convenient enough for casual use Instead we use flashing lanterns to convey messages There is another way too though it is seldom used When Vol Turin was constructed a polished trough was cut next to it The trough acts as a giant slide as high as a mountain Eragons lips twitched with a smile Is it dangerous Do not think of trying it The slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man If you slipped out of it you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches perhaps even into empty space Saphira landed a spears throw away her scales rustling dryly As she greeted Eragon humans and dwarves trickled out of Tronjheim gathering around her with murmurs of interest Eragon regarded the growing crowd uneasily Youd better go said Orik pushing him forward Meet me by this gate tomorrow morning Ill be waiting Eragon balked How will I know when its morning Ill have someone wake you Now go Without further protest Eragon slipped through the jostling group that surrounded Saphira and jumped onto her back Before she could take off an old woman stepped forward and grasped Eragons foot with a fierce grip He tried to pull away but her hand was like an iron talon around his anklehe could not break her tenacious hold The burning gray eyes she fixed on him were surrounded by a lifetimes worth of wrinklesthe skin was folded in long creases down her sunken cheeks A tattered bundle rested in the crook of her left arm Frightened Eragon asked What do you want The woman tilted her arm and a cloth fell from the bundle revealing a babys face Hoarse and desperate she said The child has no parentsthere is no one to care for her but me and I am weak Bless her with your power Argetlam Bless her for luck Eragon looked to Orik for help but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression The small crowd fell silent waiting for his response The womans eyes were still fastened on him Bless her Argetlam bless her she insisted Eragon had never blessed anyone It was not something done lightly in Alagaësia as a blessing could easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boonespecially if it was spoken with ill intent or lack of convictionDo I dare take that responsibility he wondered Bless her Argetlam bless her Suddenly decided he searched for a phrase or expression to use Nothing came to mind until inspired he thought of the ancient language This would be a true blessing spoken with words of power by one of power He bent down and tugged the glove off his right hand Laying his palm on the babes brow he intoned Atra gülai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waíse skölir frá rauthr The words left him unexpectedly weak as if he had used magic He slowly pulled the glove back on and said to the woman That is all I can do for her If any words have the power to forestall tragedy it will be those Thank you Argetlam she whispered bowing slightly She started to cover the baby again but Saphira snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child The woman grew rigid her breath caught in her chest Saphira lowered her snout and brushed the baby between the eyes with the tip of her nose then smoothly lifted away A gasp ran through the crowd for on the childs forehead where Saphira had touched her was a starshaped patch of skin as white and silvery as Eragons gedwëy ignasia The woman stared at Saphira with a feverish gaze wordless thanks in her eyes Immediately Saphira took flight battering the awestruck spectators with the wind from her powerful wing strokes As the ground dwindled away Eragon took a deep breath and hugged her neck tightlyWhat did you do he asked softly I gave her hope And you gave her a future Loneliness suddenly flowered within Eragon despite Saphiras presence Their surroundings were so foreignit struck him for the first time exactly how far he was from home A destroyed home but still where his heart layWhat have I become Saphira he askedIm only in the first year of manhood yet Ive consulted with the leader of the Varden am pursued by Galbatorix and have traveled with Morzans sonand now blessings are sought from me What wisdom can I give people that they havent already learned What feats can I achieve that an army couldnt do better Its insanity I should be back in Carvahall with Roran Saphira took a long time to answer but her words were gentle when they cameA hatchling that is what you are A hatchling struggling into the world I may be younger than you in years but I am ancient in my thoughts Do not worry about these things Find peace in where and what you are People often know what must be done All you need do is show them the waythat is wisdom As for feats no army could have given the blessing you did But it was nothinghe protestedA trifle Nay it wasnt What you saw was the beginning of another story another legend Do you think that child will ever be content to be a tavern keeper or a farmer when her brow is dragonmarked and your words hang over her You underestimate our power and that of fate Eragon bowed his headIts overwhelming I feel as if I am living in an illusion a dream where all things are possible Amazing things do happen I know but always to someone else always in some faroff place and time But I found your egg was tutored by a Rider and dueled a Shadethose cant be the actions of the farm boy I am or was Something is changing me It is your wyrd that shapes yousaid SaphiraEvery age needs an iconperhaps that lot has fallen to you Farm boys are not named for the first Rider without cause Your namesake was the beginning and now you are the continuation Or the end Achsaid Eragon shaking his headIts like speaking in riddles But if all is foreordained do our choices mean anything Or must we just learn to accept our fate Saphira said firmlyEragon I chose you from within my egg You have been given a chance most would die for Are you unhappy with that Clear your mind of such thoughts They can not be answered and will make you no happier Truehe said glumlyAll the same they continue to bounce around within my skull Things have been unsettled ever since Brom died It has made me uneasyacknowledged Saphira which surprised him because she rarely seemed perturbed They were above Tronjheim now Eragon looked down through the opening in its peak and saw the floor of the dragonhold Isidar Mithrim the great star sapphire He knew that beneath it was nothing but Tronjheims great central chamber Saphira descended to the dragonhold on silent wings She slipped over its rim and dropped to Isidar Mithrim landing with the sharp clack of claws Wont you scratch itasked Eragon I think not Its no ordinary gemEragon slid off her back and slowly turned in a circle absorbing the unusual sight They were in a round roofless room sixty feet high and sixty feet across The walls were lined with the dark openings of caves which differed in size from grottoes no larger than a man to a gaping cavern larger than a house Shiny rungs were set into the marble walls so that people could reach the highest caves An enormous archway led out of the dragonhold Eragon examined the great gem under his feet and impulsively lay down on it He pressed his cheek against the cool sapphire trying to see through it Distorted lines and wavering spots of color glimmered through the stone but its thickness made it impossible to discern anything clearly on the floor of the chamber a mile below them Will I have to sleep apart from you Saphira shook her enormous headNo there is a bed for you in my cave Come see She turned and without opening her wings jumped twenty feet into the air landing in a mediumsized cave He clambered up after her The cave was dark brown on the inside and deeper than he had expected The roughly chiseled walls gave the impression of a natural formation Near the far wall was a thick cushion large enough for Saphira to curl up on Beside it was a bed built into the side of the wall The cave was lit by a single red lantern equipped with a shutter so its glow could be muted I like thissaid EragonIt feels safe YesSaphira curled up on the cushion watching him With a sigh he sank onto the mattress weariness seeping through him Saphira you havent said much while weve been here What do you think of Tronjheim and Ajihad We shall see It seems Eragon that we are embroiled in a new type of warfare here Swords and claws are useless but words and alliances may have the same effect The Twins dislike uswe should be on our guard for any duplicities they might attempt Not many of the dwarves trust us The elves didnt want a human Rider so there will be opposition from them as well The best thing we can do is identify those in power and befriend them And quickly too Do you think its possible to remain independent of the different leaders She shuffled her wings into a more comfortable positionAjihad supports our freedom but we may be unable to survive without pledging our loyalty to one group or another Well soon know either way M ANDRAKEROOTANDNEWTSTONGUE The blankets were bunched underneath Eragon when he woke but he was still warm Saphira was asleep on her cushion her breath coming in steady gusts For the first time since entering Farthen Dûr Eragon felt secure and hopeful He was warm and fed and had been able to sleep as long as he liked Tension unknotted inside himtension that had been accumulating since Broms death and even before since leaving Palancar Valley I dont have to be afraid anymore But what about MurtaghNo matter the Vardens hospitality Eragon could not accept it in good conscience knowing thatintentionally or nothe had led Murtagh to his imprisonment Somehow the situation had to be resolved His gaze roamed the caves rough ceiling as he thought of Arya Chiding himself for daydreaming he tilted his head and looked out at the dragonhold A large cat sat on the edge of the cave licking a paw It glanced at him and he saw a flash of slanted red eyes Solembumhe asked incredulously ObviouslyThe werecat shook his rough mane and yawned languorously displaying his long fangs He stretched then jumped out of the cave landing with a solid thump on Isidar Mithrim twenty feet belowComing Eragon looked at Saphira She was awake now watching him motionlesslyGo I will be fine she murmured Solembum was waiting for him under the arch that led to the rest of Tronjheim The moment Eragons feet touched Isidar Mithrim the werecat turned with a flick of his paws and disappeared through the arch Eragon chased after him rubbing the sleep from his face He stepped through the archway and found himself standing at the top of Vol Turin The Endless Staircase There was nowhere else to go so he descended to the next level He stood in an open arcade that curved gently to the left and encircled Tronjheims central chamber Between the slender columns supporting the arches Eragon could see Isidar Mithrim sparkling brilliantly above him as well as the citymountains distant base The circumference of the central chamber increased with each successive level The staircase cut through the arcades floor to an identical level below and descended through scores of arcades until it disappeared in the distance The sliding trough ran along the outside curve of the stairs At the top of Vol Turin was a pile of leather squares to slide on To Eragons right a dusty corridor led to that levels rooms and apartments Solembum padded down the hall flipping his tail Waitsaid Eragon He tried to catch up with Solembum but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned passageways Then as Eragon rounded a corner he saw the werecat stop before a door and yowl Seemingly of its own accord the door slid inward Solembum slipped inside then the door shut Eragon halted in front of it perplexed He raised his hand to knock but before he did the door opened once more and warm light spilled out After a moments indecision he stepped inside He entered an earthy tworoom suite lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants The air was warm fresh and humid Bright lanterns hung on the walls and from the low ceiling Piles of intriguing items cluttered the floor obscuring the corners A large fourposter bed curtained by even more plants was in the far room In the center of the main room on a plush leather chair sat the fortuneteller and witch Angela She smiled brightly What are you doing here blurted Eragon Angela folded her hands in her lap Well why dont you sit on the floor and Ill tell you Id offer you a chair but Im sitting on the only one Questions buzzed through Eragons mind as he settled between two flasks of acrid bubbling green potions So exclaimed Angela leaning forward Youare a Rider I suspected as much but I didnt know for certain until yesterday Im sure Solembum knew but he never told me I should have figured it out the moment you mentioned Brom Saphira I like the namefitting for a dragon Broms dead said Eragon abruptly The Razac killed him Angela was taken aback She twirled a lock of her dense curls Im sorry I truly am she said softly Eragon smiled bitterly But not surprised are you You foretold his death after all I didnt know whose death it would be she said shaking her head But no Im not surprised I met Brom once or twice He didnt care for my frivolous attitude toward magic It irritated him Eragon frowned In Teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke Why Angelas face tightened momentarily In retrospect it was in rather bad taste but I didnt know what would befall him How do I put this Brom was cursed in a way It was his wyrd to fail at all of his tasks except one although through no fault of his own He was chosen as a Rider but his dragon was killed He loved a woman but it was his affection that was her undoing And he was chosen I assume to guard and train you but in the end he failed at that as well The only thing he succeeded at was killing Morzan and a better deed he couldnt have done Brom never mentioned a woman to me retorted Eragon Angela shrugged carelessly I heard it from one who couldnt have lied But enough of this talk Life goes on and we should not trouble the dead with our worries She scooped a pile of reeds from the floor and deftly started plaiting them together closing the subject to discussion Eragon hesitated then gave in All right So why are you in Tronjheim instead of Teirm Ah at last an interesting question said Angela After hearing Broms name again during your visit I sensed a return of the past in Alagaësia People were whispering that the Empire was hunting a Rider I knew then that the Vardens dragon egg must have hatched so I closed my shop and set out to learn more You knew about the egg Of course I did Im not an idiot Ive been around much longer than you would believe Very little happens that I dont know about She paused and concentrated on her weaving Anyway I knew I had to get to the Varden as fast as possible Ive been here for nearly a month now though I really dont care for this placeits far too musty for my taste And everyone in Farthen Dûr isso serious and noble Theyre probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway She gave a long sigh a mocking expression on her face And the dwarves are just a superstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their lives The only redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow inside Farthen Dûr Then why stay asked Eragon smiling Because I like to be wherever important events are occurring said Angela cocking her head Besides if I had stayed in Teirm Solembum would have left without me and I enjoy his company But tell me what adventures have befallen you since last we talked For the next hour Eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months Angela listened quietly but when he mentioned Murtaghs name she sputtered Murtagh Eragon nodded He told me who he is But let me finish my story before you make any judgments He continued with his tale When it was complete Angela leaned back in her chair thoughtfully her reeds forgotten Without warning Solembum jumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap He curled up eyeing Eragon haughtily Angela petted the werecat Fascinating Galbatorix allied with the Urgals and Murtagh finally out in the open Id warn you to be careful with Murtagh but youre obviously aware of the danger Murtagh has been a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally said Eragon firmly All the same be careful Angela paused then said distastefully And then theres the matter of this Shade Durza I think hes the greatest threat to the Varden right now aside from Galbatorix Iloathe Shadesthey practice the most unholy magic after necromancy Id like to dig his heart out with a dull hairpin and feed it to a pig Eragon was startled by her sudden vehemence I dont understand Brom told me that Shades were sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will but why does that make them so evil Angela shook her head It doesnt Ordinary sorcerers are just that ordinaryneither better nor worse than the rest of us They use their magical strength to control spirits and the spirits powers Shades however relinquish that control in their search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlledby spirits Unfortunately only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans and once ensconced they never leave Such possession can happen by accident if a sorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself The problem is once a Shade is created its terribly difficult to kill As Im sure you know only two people Laetri the Elf and Irnstad the Rider ever survived that feat Ive heard the stories Eragon gestured at the room Why are you living so high up in Tronjheim Isnt it inconvenient being this isolated And how did you get all this stuff up here Angela threw back her head and laughed wryly Truthfully Im in hiding When I first came to Tronjheim I had a few days of peaceuntil one of guards who let me into Farthen Dûr blabbed about who I was Then all the magic users here though theybarely rate the term pestered me to join their secret group Especially those drajl Twins who control it Finally I threatened to turn the lot of them into toads excuse me frogs but when that didnt deter them I sneaked up here in the middle of the night It was less work than you might imagine especially for one with my skills Did you have to let the Twins into your mind before you were allowed into Farthen Dûr asked Eragon I was forced to let them sift through my memories A cold gleam leapt into Angelas eye The Twins wouldnt dare probe me for fear of what I might do to them Oh theyd love to but they know the effort would leave them broken and gibbering nonsense Ive been coming here long before the Varden began examining peoples minds and theyre not about to start on me now She peered into the other room and said Well This has been an enlightening talk but Im afraid you have to go now My brew of mandrake root and newts tongue is about to boil and it needs attending Do come back again when you have the time Andplease dont tell anyone that Im here Id hate to have to move again It would make me very irritated And you dont want to see me irritated Ill keep your secret assured Eragon getting up Solembum jumped off Angelas lap as she stood Good she exclaimed Eragon said farewell and left the room Solembum guided him back to the dragonhold then dismissed him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away H ALL OF THE MOUNTAINKING Adwarf was waiting for Eragon in the dragonhold After bowing and muttering Argetlam the dwarf said with a thick accent Good Awake Knurla Orik waits for you He bowed again and scurried away Saphira jumped out of her cave landing next to Eragon Zarroc was in her claws Whats that forhe asked frowning She tilted her headWear it You are a Rider and should bear a Riders sword Zarroc may have a bloody history but that should not shape your actions Forge a new history for it and carry it with pride Are you sureRemember Ajihads counsel Saphira snorted and a puff of smoke rose from her nostrilsWear it Eragon If you wish to remain above the forces here do not let anyones disapproval dictate your actions As you wishhe said reluctantly buckling on the sword He clambered onto her back and Saphira flew out of Tronjheim There was enough light in Farthen Dûr now that the hazy mass of the crater wallsfive miles away in each directionwas visible While they spiraled down to the citymountains base Eragon told Saphira about his meeting with Angela As soon as they landed by one of Tronjheims gates Orik ran to Saphiras side My king Hrothgar wishes to see both of you Dismount quickly We must hurry Eragon trotted after the dwarf into Tronjheim Saphira easily kept pace beside them Ignoring stares from people within the soaring corridor Eragon asked Where will we meet Hrothgar Without slowing Orik said In the throne room beneath the city It will be a private audience as an act of othoof faith You do not have to address him in any special manner but speak to him respectfully Hrothgar is quick to anger but he is wise and sees keenly into the minds of men so think carefully before you speak Once they entered Tronjheims central chamber Orik led the way to one of the two descending stairways that flanked the opposite hall They started down the righthand staircase which gently curved inward until it faced the direction they had come from The other stairway merged with theirs to form a broad cascade of dimly lit steps that ended after a hundred feet before two granite doors A sevenpointed crown was carved across both doors Seven dwarves stood guard on each side of the portal They held burnished mattocks and wore gemencrusted belts As Eragon Orik and Saphira approached the dwarves pounded the floor with the mattocks hafts A deep boom rolled back up the stairs The doors swung inward A dark hall lay before them a good bowshot long The throne room was a natural cave the walls were lined with stalagmites and stalactites each thicker than a man Sparsely hung lanterns cast a moody light The brown floor was smooth and polished At the far end of the hall was a black throne with a motionless figure upon it Orik bowed The king awaits you Eragon put his hand on Saphiras side and the two of them continued forward The doors closed behind them leaving them alone in the dim throne room with the king Their footsteps echoed through the hall as they advanced toward the throne In the recesses between the stalagmites and stalactites rested large statues Each sculpture depicted a dwarf king crowned and sitting on a throne their sightless eyes gazed sternly into the distance their lined faces set in fierce expressions A name was chiseled in runes beneath each set of feet Eragon and Saphira strode solemnly between the two rows of longdead monarchs They passed more than forty statues then only dark and empty alcoves awaiting future kings They stopped before Hrothgar at the end of the hall The dwarf king himself sat like a statue upon a raised throne carved from a single piece of black marble It was blocky unadorned and cut with unyielding precision Strength emanated from the throne strength that harked back to ancient times when dwarves had ruled in Alagaësia without opposition from elves or humans A gold helm lined with rubies and diamonds rested on Hrothgars head in place of a crown His visage was grim weathered and hewn of many years experience Beneath a craggy brow glinted deepset eyes flinty and piercing Over his powerful chest rippled a shirt of mail His white beard was tucked under his belt and in his lap he held a mighty war hammer with the symbol of Oriks clan embossed on its head Eragon bowed awkwardly and knelt Saphira remained upright The king stirred as if awakening from a long sleep and rumbled Rise Rider you need not pay tribute to me Straightening Eragon met Hrothgars impenetrable eyes The king inspected him with a hard gaze then said gutturally Âz knurl deimi lanokBeware the rock changesan old dictum of ours And nowadays the rock changes very fast indeed He fingered the war hammer I could not meet with you earlier as Ajihad did because I was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans They demanded that I deny you sanctuary and expel you from Farthen Dûr It has taken much work on my part to convince them otherwise Thank you said Eragon I didnt anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause The king accepted his thanks then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed See there Rider Eragon where my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones One and forty there are with I the fortysecond When I pass from this world into the care of the gods my hírna will be added to their ranks The first statue is the likeness of my ancestor Korgan who forged this mace Volund For eight millenniasince the dawn of our racedwarves have ruled under Farthen Dûr We are the bones of the land older than both the fair elves and the savage dragons Saphira shifted slightly Hrothgar leaned forward his voice gravelly and deep I am old humaneven by our reckoningold enough to have seen the Riders in all their fleeting glory old enough to have spoken with their last leader Vrael who paid tribute to me within these very walls Few are still alive who can claim that much I remember the Riders and how they meddled in our affairs I also remember the peace they kept that made it possible to walk unharmed from Tronjheim to Narda And now you stand before mea lost tradition revived Tell me and speak truly in this why have you come to Farthen Dûr I know of the events that made you flee the Empire but what is your intent now For now Saphira and I merely want to recuperate in Tronjheim Eragon replied We are not here to cause trouble only to find sanctuary from the dangers weve faced for many months Ajihad may send us to the elves but until he does we have no wish to leave Then was it only the desire for safety that drove you asked Hrothgar Do you just seek to live here and forget your troubles with the Empire Eragon shook his head his pride rejecting that statement If Ajihad told you of my past you should know that I have grievances enough to fight the Empire until it is nothing but scattered ashes More than that though I want to aid those who can not escape Galbatorix including my cousin I have the strength to help so I must The king seemed satisfied by his answer He turned to Saphira and asked Dragon what think you in this matter For what reason have you come Saphira lifted the edge of her lip to growlTell him that I thirst for the blood of our enemies and eagerly await the day when we ride to battle against Galbatorix Ive no love or mercy for traitors and egg breakers like that false king He held me for over a century and even now still has two of my brethren whom I would free if possible And tell Hrothgar I think you ready for this task Eragon grimaced at her words but dutifully relayed them The corner of Hrothgars mouth lifted in a hint of grim amusement deepening his wrinkles I see that dragons have not changed with the centuries He rapped the throne with a knuckle Do you know why this seat was quarried so flat and angular So that no one would sit comfortably on it I have not and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes What is there to remind you of your obligations Eragon If the Empire falls will you take Galbatorixs place and claim his kingship I dont seek to wear the crown or rule said Eragon troubled Being a Rider is responsibility enough No I would not take the throne in Urûbaen not unless there was no one else willing or competent enough to take it Hrothgar warned gravely Certainly you would be a kinder king than Galbatorix but no race should have a leader who does not age or leave the throne The time of the Riders has passed Eragon They will never rise againnot even if Galbatorixs other eggs were to hatch A shadow crossed his face as he gazed at Eragons side I see that you carry an enemys sword I was told of this and that you travel with a son of the Forsworn It does not please me to see this weapon He extended a hand I would like to examine it Eragon drew Zarroc and presented it to the king hilt first Hrothgar grasped the sword and ran a practiced eye over the red blade The edge caught the lantern light reflecting it sharply The dwarf king tested the point with his palm then said A masterfully forged blade Elves rarely choose to make swordsthey prefer bows and spearsbut when they do the results are unmatched This is an illfated blade I am not glad to see it within my realm But carry it if you will perhaps its luck has changed He returned Zarroc and Eragon sheathed it Has my nephew proved helpful during your time here Who Hrothgar raised a tangled eyebrow Orik my youngest sisters son Hes been serving under Ajihad to show my support for the Varden It seems that he has been returned to my command however I was gratified to hear that you defended him with your words Eragon understood that this was another sign of otho of faith on Hrothgars part I couldnt ask for a better guide That is good said the king clearly pleased Unfortunately I can not speak with you much longer My advisors wait for me as there are matters I must deal with I will say this though If you wish the support of the dwarves within my realm you must first prove yourself to them We have long memories and do not rush to hasty decisions Words will decide nothing only deeds I will keep that in mind said Eragon bowing again Hrothgar nodded regally You may go then Eragon turned with Saphira and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king Orik was waiting for them on the other side of the stone doors an anxious expression on his face He fell in with them as they climbed back up to Tronjheims main chamber Did all go well Were you received favorably I think so But your king is cautious said Eragon That is how he has survived this long I would not want Hrothgar angry at usobserved Saphira Eragon glanced at herNo I wouldnt either Im not sure what he thought of youhe seems to disapprove of dragons though he didnt say it outright That seemed to amuse SaphiraIn that he is wise especially since hes barely kneehigh to me In Tronjheims center under the sparkling Isidar Mithrim Orik said Your blessing yesterday has stirred up the Varden like an overturned beehive The child Saphira touched has been hailed as a future hero She and her guardian have been quartered in the finest rooms Everyone is talking about your miracle All the human mothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children Alarmed Eragon furtively looked around What should we do Aside from taking back your actions asked Orik dryly Stay out of sight as much as possible Everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold so you wont be disturbed there Eragon did not want to return to the dragonhold yet It was early in the day and he wanted to explore Tronjheim with Saphira Now that they were out of the Empire there was no reason for them to be apart But he wanted to avoid attention which would be impossible with her at his sideSaphira what do you want to do She nosed him scales brushing his armIll return to the dragonhold Theres someone there I want to meet Wander around as long as you like All righthe saidbut who do you want to meet Saphira only winked a large eye at him before padding down one of Tronjheims four main tunnels Eragon explained to Orik where she was going then said Id like some breakfast And then Id like to see more of Tronjheim its such an incredible place I dont want to go to the training grounds until tomorrow as Im still not fully recovered Orik nodded his beard bobbing on his chest In that case would you like to visit Tronjheims library Its quite old and contains many scrolls of great value You might find it interesting to read a history of Alagaësia that hasnt been tainted by Galbatorixs hand With a pang Eragon remembered how Brom had taught him to read He wondered if he still had the skill A long time had passed since he had seen any written words Yes lets do that Very well After they ate Orik guided Eragon through myriad corridors to their destination When they reached the librarys carved arch Eragon stepped through it reverently The room reminded him of a forest Rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark ribbed ceiling five stories above Between the pillars blackmarble bookcases stood back to back Racks of scrolls covered the walls interspersed with narrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases Placed at regular intervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches Between them were small tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor Countless books and scrolls were stored in the room This is the true legacy of our race said Orik Here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars from antiquity to the present Also recorded are the songs and stories composed by our artisans This library may be our most precious possession It isnt all our work thoughthere are human writings here as well Yours is a shortlivedbut prolificrace We have little or nothing of the elves They guard their secrets jealously How long may I stay asked Eragon moving toward the shelves As long as you want Come to me if you have any questions Eragon browsed through the volumes with delight reaching eagerly for those with interesting titles or covers Surprisingly dwarves used the same runes to write as humans He was somewhat disheartened by how hard reading was after months of neglect He skipped from book to book slowly working his way deep into the vast library Eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by Dóndar the tenth dwarf king As he scanned the graceful lines unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase The sound startled him but he berated himself for being sillyhe could not be the only person in the library Even so he quietly replaced the book and slipped away senses alert for danger He had been ambushed too many times to ignore such feelings He heard the footsteps again only now there were two sets of them Apprehensive he darted across an opening trying to remember exactly where Orik was sitting He sidestepped around a corner and started as he found himself face to face with the Twins The Twins stood together their shoulders meeting a blank expression on their smooth faces Their black snake eyes bored into him Their hands hidden within the folds of their purple robes twitched slightly They both bowed but the movement was insolent and derisive We have been searching for you one said His voice was uncomfortably like the Razacs Eragon suppressed a shiver What for He reached out with his mind and contacted Saphira She immediately joined thoughts with him Ever since you met with Ajihad we have wanted to apologize for our actions The words were mocking but not in a way Eragon could challenge We have come to pay homage to you Eragon flushed angrily as they bowed again Carefulwarned Saphira He pushed back his rising temper He could not afford to be riled by this confrontation An idea came to him and he said with a small smile Nay it is I who pay homage to you Without your approval I never could have gained entrance to Farthen Dûr He bowed to them in turn making the movement as insulting as he could There was a flicker of irritation in the Twins eyes but they smiled and said We are honored that one so important as yourself thinks so highly of us We are in your debt for your kind words Now it was Eragons turn to be irritated I will remember that when Im in need Saphira intruded sharply in his thoughtsYoure overdoing itDont say anything youll regret They will remember every word they can use against you This is difficult enough without you making commentshe snapped She subsided with an exasperated grumble The Twins moved closer the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor Their voices became more pleasant We have searched for you for another reason as well Rider The few magic users who live in Tronjheim have formed a group We call ourselves Du Vrangr Gata or the The Wandering Path I know interrupted Eragon remembering what Angela had said about it Your knowledge of the ancient language is impressive said a Twin smoothly As we were saying Du Vrangr Gata has heard of your mighty feats and we have come to extend an invitation of membership We would be honored to have one of your stature as a member And I suspect that we might be able to assist you as well How The other Twin said The two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters We could guide you show you spells weve discovered and teach you words of power Nothing would gladden us more than if we could assist in some small way your path to glory No repayment would be necessary though if you saw fit to share some scraps of your own knowledge we would be satisfied Eragons face hardened as he realized what they were asking for Do you think Im a halfwit he demanded harshly I wont apprentice myself to you so you can learn the words Brom taught me It must have angered you when you couldnt steal them from my mind The Twins abruptly dropped their facade of smiles We are not to be trifled with boy We are the ones who will test your abilities with magic And that could bemost unpleasant Remember it only takes one misconceived spell to kill someone You may be a Rider but the two of us are still stronger than you Eragon kept his face expressionless even as his stomach knotted painfully I will consider your offer but it may Then we will expect your answer tomorrow Make sure that it is the right one They smiled coldly and stalked deeper into the library Eragon scowledIm not going to join Du Vrangr Gata no matter what they do You should talk to Angelasaid SaphiraShes dealt with the Twins before Perhaps she could be there when they test you That might prevent them from harming you Thats a good ideaEragon wound through the bookcases until he found Orik sitting on a bench busily polishing his war ax Id like to return to the dragonhold The dwarf slid the haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt then escorted Eragon to the gate where Saphira waited People had already gathered around her Ignoring them Eragon scrambled onto Saphiras back and they escaped to the sky This problem must be resolved quickly You can not let the Twins intimidate youSaphira said as she landed on Isidar Mithrim I know But I hope we can avoid angering themThey could be dangerous enemiesHe dismounted quickly keeping a hand on Zarroc So can you Do you want them as allies He shook his headNot really Ill tell them tomorrow that I wont join Du Vrangr Gata Eragon left Saphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold He wanted to see Angela but he didnt remember how to find her hiding place and Solembum was not there to guide him He roamed the deserted corridors hoping to meet Angela by chance When he grew tired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls he retraced his footsteps to the hold As he neared it he heard someone speaking within the room He halted and listened but the clear voice fell silentSaphiraWhos in there A female She has an air of command Ill distract her while you come inEragon loosened Zarroc in its sheathOrik said that intruders would be kept out of the dragonhold so who could this be He steadied his nerves then stepped into the hold his hand on the sword A young woman stood in the center of the room looking curiously at Saphira who had stuck her head out of the cave The woman appeared to be about seventeen years old The star sapphire cast a rosy light on her accentuating skin the same deep shade as Ajihads Her velvet dress was wine red and elegantly cut A jeweled dagger worn with use hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath Eragon crossed his arms waiting for the woman to notice him She continued to look at Saphira then curtsied and asked sweetly Please could you tell me where Rider Eragon is Saphiras eyes sparkled with amusement With a small smile Eragon said I am here The woman whirled to face him hand flying to her dagger Her face was striking with almondshaped eyes wide lips and round cheekbones She relaxed and curtsied again I am Nasuada she said Eragon inclined his head You obviously know who I am but what do you want Nasuada smiled charmingly My father Ajihad sent me here with a message Would you like to hear it The Vardens leader had not struck Eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood He wondered who Nasuadas mother wasshe must have been an uncommon woman to have attracted Ajihads eye Yes I would Nasuada tossed her hair back and recited He is pleased that you are doing well but he cautions you against actions like your benediction yesterday They create more problems than they solve Also he urges you to proceed with the testing as soon as possiblehe needs to know how capable you are before he communicates with the elves Did you climb all the way up here just to tell me that Eragon asked thinking of Vol Turins length Nasuada shook her head I used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels We could have sent the message with signals but I decided to bring it myself and meet you in person Would you like to sit down asked Eragon He motioned toward Saphiras cave Nasuada laughed lightly No I am expected elsewhere You should also know my father decreed that you may visit Murtagh if you wish A somber expression disturbed her previously smooth features I met Murtagh earlier Hes anxious to speak with you He seemed lonely you should visit him She gave Eragon directions to Murtaghs cell Eragon thanked her for the news then asked What about Arya Is she better Can I see her Orik wasnt able to tell me much She smiled mischievously Arya is recovering swiftly as all elves do No one is allowed to see her except my father Hrothgar and the healers They have spent much time with her learning all that occurred during her imprisonment She swept her eyes over Saphira I must go now Is there anything you would have me convey to Ajihad on your behalf No except a desire to visit Arya And give him my thanks for the hospitality hes shown us I will take your words directly to him Farewell Rider Eragon I hope we shall soon meet again She curtsied and exited the dragonhold head held high If she really came all the way up Tronjheim just to meet mepulleys or no pulleysthere was more to this meeting than idle chatterremarked Eragon Ayesaid Saphira withdrawing her head into the cave Eragon climbed up to her and was surprised to see Solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck The werecat was purring deeply his blacktipped tail flicking back and forth The two of them looked at Eragon impudently as if to ask What Eragon shook his head laughing helplesslySaphira is Solembum who you wanted to meet They both blinked at him and answeredYes Just wonderinghe said mirth still bubbling inside him It made sense that they would befriend each othertheir personalities were similar and they were both creatures of magic He sighed releasing some of the days tension as he unbuckled ZarrocSolembum do you know where Angela is I couldnt find her and I need her advice Solembum kneaded his paws against Saphiras scaled backShe is somewhere in Tronjheim When will she return Soon How soonhe asked impatientlyI need to talk to her today Not that soon The werecat refused to say more despite Eragons persistent questions He gave up and nestled against Saphira Solembums purring was a low thrum above his headI have to visit Murtagh tomorrow he thought fingering Broms ring A RYASTEST On the morning of their third day in Tronjheim Eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized He belted Zarroc to his waist and slung his bow and halffull quiver across his back After a leisurely flight inside Farthen Dûr with Saphira he met Orik by one of Tronjheims four main gates Eragon asked him about Nasuada An unusual girl answered Orik glancing disapprovingly at Zarroc Shes totally devoted to her father and spends all her time helping him I think she does more for Ajihad than he knowsthere have been times when shes maneuvered his enemies without ever revealing her part in it Who is her mother That I dont know Ajihad was alone when he brought Nasuada to Farthen Dûr as a newborn child Hes never said where he and Nasuada came from So she too grew up without knowing her motherHe shook off the thought Im restless Itll be good to use my muscles Where should I go for this testing of Ajihads Orik pointed out into Farthen Dûr The training field is half a mile from Tronjheim though you cant see it from here because its behind the citymountain Its a large area where both dwarves and humans practice Im coming as wellstated Saphira Eragon told Orik and the dwarf tugged on his beard That might not be a good idea There are many people at the training field you will be sure to attract attention Saphira growled loudlyI will come And that settled the matter The unruly clatter of fighting reached them from the field the loud clang of steel clashing on steel the solid thump of arrows striking padded targets the rattle and crack of wooden staves and the shouts of men in mock battle The noise was confusing yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern The bulk of the training ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling with shields and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves They drilled as a group in formations Practicing beside them were hundreds of individual warriors outfitted with swords maces spears staves flails shields of all shapes and sizes and even Eragon saw someone with a pitchfork Nearly all the fighters wore armor usually chain mail and a helmet plate armor was not as common There were as many dwarves as humans though the two kept mainly to themselves Behind the sparring warriors a broad line of archers fired steadily at gray sackcloth dummies Before Eragon had time to wonder what he was supposed to do a bearded man his head and blocky shoulders covered by a mail coif strode over to them The rest of him was protected by a rough oxhide suit that still had hair on it A huge swordalmost as long as Eragonhung across his broad back He ran a quick eye over Saphira and Eragon as if evaluating how dangerous they were then said gruffly Knurla Orik Youve been gone too long Theres nobody left for me to spar with Orik smiled Oeí thats because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster sword Everyone except you he corrected Thats because Im faster than a giant like you The man looked at Eragon again Im Fredric Ive been told to find out what you can do How strong are you Strong enough answered Eragon I have to be in order to fight with magic Fredric shook his head the coif clinked like a bag of coins Magic has no place in what we do here Unless youve served in an army I doubt any fights youve been in lasted more than a few minutes What were concerned about is how youll be able to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours or even weeks if its a siege Do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow Eragon thought about it Only my fists Good answer laughed Fredric Well well start you off with the bow and see how you do Then once some space has cleared up on the field well try He broke off suddenly and stared past Eragon scowling angrily The Twins stalked toward them their bald heads pale against their purple robes Orik muttered something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his belt I told you two to stay away from the training area said Fredric stepping forward threateningly The Twins seemed frail before his bulk They looked at him arrogantly We were ordered by Ajihad to test Eragons proficiency with magicbeforeyou exhaust him banging on pieces of metal Fredric glowered Why cant someone else test him No one else is powerful enough sniffed the Twins Saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them A line of smoke trickled from her nostrils but they ignored her Come with us they ordered and strode to an empty corner of the field Shrugging Eragon followed with Saphira Behind him he heard Fredric say to Orik We have to stop them from going too far I know answered Orik in a low voice but I cant interfere again Hrothgar made it clear he wont be able to protect me the next time it happens Eragon forced back his growing apprehension The Twins might know more techniques and words Still he remembered what Brom had told him Riders were stronger in magic than ordinary men But would that be enough to resist the combined power of the Twins Dont worry so much I will help yousaid SaphiraThere are two of us as well He touched her gently on the leg relieved by her words The Twins looked at Eragon and asked And how do you answer us Eragon Overlooking the puzzled expressions of his companions he said flatly No Sharp lines appeared at the corners of the Twins mouths They turned so they faced Eragon obliquely and bending at the waists drew a large pentagram on the ground They stepped in the middle of it then said harshly We begin now You will attempt to complete the tasks we assign you that is all One of the Twins reached into his robe produced a polished rock the size of Eragons fist and set it on the ground Lift it to eye level Thats easy enoughcommented Eragon to Saphira Stenr reisa The rock wobbled then smoothly rose from the ground Before it went more than a foot an unexpected resistance halted it in midair A smile touched the Twins lips Eragon stared at them enragedthey were trying to make him fail If he became exhausted now it would be impossible to complete the harder tasks Obviously they were confident that their combined strength could easily wear him down But Im not alone eithersnarled Eragon to himselfSaphira now Her mind melded with his and the rock jerked through the air to stop quivering at eye level The Twins eyes narrowed cruelly Very good they hissed Fredric looked unnerved by the display of magic Now move the stone in a circle Again Eragon struggled against their efforts to stop him and againto their obvious angerhe prevailed The exercises quickly increased in complexity and difficulty until Eragon was forced to think carefully about which words to use And each time the Twins fought him bitterly though the strain never showed on their faces It was only with Saphiras support that Eragon was able to hold his ground In a break between two of the tasks he asked herWhy do they continue this testing Our abilities were clear enough from what they saw in my mind She cocked her head thoughtfullyYou know what he said grimly as comprehension came to himTheyre using this as an opportunity to figure out what ancient words I know and perhaps learn new ones themselves Speak softly then so that they can not hear you and use the simplest words possible From then on Eragon used only a handful of basic words to complete the tasks But finding ways to make them perform in the same manner as a long sentence or phrase stretched his ingenuity to the limit He was rewarded by the frustration that contorted the Twins faces as he foiled them again and again No matter what they tried they could not get him to use any more words in the ancient language More than an hour passed but the Twins showed no sign of stopping Eragon was hot and thirsty but refrained from asking for a reprievehe would continue as long as they did There were many tests manipulating water casting fire scrying juggling rocks hardening leather freezing items controlling the flight of an arrow and healing scratches He wondered how long it would take for the Twins to run out of ideas Finally the Twins raised their hands and said There is only one thing left to do It is simple enoughanycompetent user of magic should find this easy One of them removed a silver ring from his finger and smugly handed it to Eragon Summon the essence of silver Eragon stared at the ring in confusion What was he supposed to do The essence of silver what was that And how was it to be summoned Saphira had no idea and the Twins were not going to help He had never learned silvers name in the ancient language though he knew it had to be part ofargetlam In desperation he combined the only word that might workethgrí or invoke witharget Drawing himself upright he gathered together what power he had left and parted his lips to deliver the invocation Suddenly a clear vibrant voice split the air Stop The word rushed over Eragon like cool waterthe voice was strangely familiar like a halfremembered melody The back of his neck tingled He slowly turned toward its source A lone figure stood behind them Arya A leather strip encircled her brow restraining her voluminous black hair which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous cascade Her slender sword was at her hip her bow on her back Plain black leather clothed her shapely frame poor raiment for one so fair She was taller than most men and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed An unmarked face reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured Aryas blazing emerald eyes were fixed on the Twins who had turned pale with fright She approached on silent footsteps and said in soft menacing tones Shame Shame to ask of him what only a master can do Shame that you should use such methods Shame that you told Ajihad you didnt know Eragons abilities He is competent Now leave Arya frowned dangerously her slanted eyebrows meeting like lightning bolts in a sharp V and pointed at the ring in Eragons hand Arget she exclaimed thunderously The silver shimmered and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it The two were identical except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed whitehot At the sight of it the Twins spun on their heels and fled robes flapping wildly The insubstantial ring vanished from Eragons hand leaving the circlet of silver behind Orik and Fredric were on their feet eyeing Arya warily Saphira crouched ready for action The elf surveyed them all Her angled eyes paused on Eragon Then she turned and strode toward the heart of the training field The warriors ceased their sparring and looked at her with wonder Within a few moments the entire field fell silent in awe of her presence Eragon was inexorably dragged forward by his own fascination Saphira spoke but he was oblivious to her comments A large circle formed around Arya Looking only at Eragon she proclaimed I claim the right of trial by arms Draw your sword She means to duel me But not I think to harm youreplied Saphira slowly She nudged him with her noseGo and acquit yourself well I will watch Eragon reluctantly stepped forward He did not want to do this when he was exhausted from magic use and when there were so many people watching Besides Arya could be in no shape for sparring It had only been two days since she had received Túnivors NectarI will soften my blows so I dont hurt her he decided They faced each other across the circle of warriors Arya drew her sword with her left hand The weapon was thinner than Eragons but just as long and sharp He slid Zarroc out of its polished sheath and held the red blade pointdown by his side For a long moment they stood motionless elf and human watching each other It flashed through Eragons mind that this was how many of his fights with Brom had started He moved forward cautiously With a blur of motion Arya jumped at him slashing at his ribs Eragon reflexively parried the attack and their swords met in a shower of sparks Zarroc was batted aside as if it were no more than a fly The elf did not take advantage of the opening however but spun to her right hair whipping through the air and struck at his other side He barely stopped the blow and backpedaled frantically stunned by her ferocity and speed Belatedly Eragon remembered Broms warning that even the weakest elf could easily overpower a human He had about as much chance of defeating Arya as he did Durza She attacked again swinging at his head He ducked under the razorsharp edge But then why was she toying with him For a few long seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it then he realizedShe wants to know how proficient I am Understanding that he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew He flowed from one pose to another recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible way But no matter how inventive he was Aryas sword always stopped his She matched his actions with effortless grace Engaged in a fiery dance their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades At times they nearly touched taut skin only a hairs breadth away but then momentum would whirl them apart and they would withdraw for a second only to join again Their sinuous forms wove together like twisting ropes of windblown smoke Eragon could never remember how long they fought It was timeless filled with nothing but action and reaction Zarroc grew leaden in his hand his arm burned ferociously with each stroke At last as he lunged forward Arya nimbly sidestepped sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with supernatural speed Eragon froze as the icy metal touched his skin His muscles trembled from the exertion Dimly he heard Saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them Arya lowered her sword and sheathed it You have passed she said quietly amid the noise Dazed he slowly straightened Fredric was beside him now thumping his back enthusiastically That was incredible swordsmanship I even learned some new moves from watching the two of you And the elfstunning But I losthe protested silently Orik praised his performance with a broad smile but all Eragon noticed was Arya standing alone and silent She motioned slightly with a finger no more than a twitch toward a knoll about a mile from the practice field then turned and walked away The crowd melted before her A hush fell over the men and dwarves as she passed Eragon turned to Orik I have to go Ill return to the dragonhold soon With a swift jab Eragon sheathed Zarroc and pulled himself onto Saphira She took off over the training field which turned into a sea of faces as everyone looked at her As they soared toward the knoll Eragon saw Arya running below them with clean easy strides Saphira commentedYou find her form pleasing do you not Yeshe admitted blushing Her face does have more character than that of most humansshe sniffedBut its long like a horses and overall shes rather shapeless Eragon looked at Saphira with amazementYoure jealous arent you Impossible I never get jealousshe said offended You are now admit ithe laughed She snapped her jaws together loudlyI am not He smiled and shook his head but let her denial stand She landed heavily on the knoll jostling him roughly He jumped down without remarking on it Arya was close behind them Her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner Eragon had seen When she reached the top of the knoll her breathing was smooth and regular Suddenly tonguetied Eragon dropped his gaze She strode past him and said to Saphira Skulblaka eka celöbra ono un mulabra ono un onr Shurtugal né haina Atra nosu waíse fricai Eragon did not recognize most of the words but Saphira obviously understood the message She shuffled her wings and surveyed Arya curiously Then she nodded humming deeply Arya smiled I am glad that you recovered Eragon said We didnt know if you would live or not That is why I came here today said Arya facing him Her rich voice was accented and exotic She spoke clearly with a hint of trill as if she were about to sing I owe you a debt that must be repaid You saved my life That can never be forgotten Itit was nothing said Eragon fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true even as he spoke them Embarrassed he changed the subject How did you come to be in Gilead Pain shadowed Aryas face She looked away into the distance Let us walk They descended from the knoll and meandered toward Farthen Dûr Eragon respected Aryas silence as they walked Saphira padded quietly beside them Finally Arya lifted her head and said with the grace of her kind Ajihad told me you were present when Saphiras egg appeared Yes For the first time Eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the egg over the dozens of leagues that separated Du Weldenvarden from the Spine To even attempt such a feat was courting disaster if not death Her next words were heavy Then know this at the moment you first beheld it I was captured by Durza Her voice filled with bitterness and grief It was he who led the Urgals that ambushed and slew my companions Faolin and Glenwing Somehow he knew where to wait for uswe had no warning I was drugged and transported to Gilead There Durza was charged by Galbatorix to learn where I had sent the egg and all I knew of Ellesméra She stared ahead icily jaw clenched He tried for months without success His methods were harsh When torture failed he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would Fortunately I still had the strength to nudge their minds and make them incapable At last Galbatorix ordered that I was to be brought to Urûbaen Dread filled me when I learned this as I was weary in both mind and body and had no strength to resist him If it were not for you I would have stood before Galbatorix in a weeks time Eragon shuddered inwardly It was amazing what she had survived The memory of her injuries was still vivid in his mind Softly he asked Why do you tell me all this So that you know what I was saved from Do not presume I can ignore your deed Humbled he bowed his head What will you do nowreturn to Ellesméra No not yet There is much that must be done here I can not abandon the VardenAjihad needs my help Ive seen you tested in both arms and magic today Brom taught you well You are ready to proceed in your training You mean for me to go to Ellesméra Yes Eragon felt a flash of irritation Did he and Saphira have no say in the matter When That is yet to be decided but not for some weeks At least they gave us that much timethought Eragon Saphira mentioned something to him and he in turn asked Arya What did the Twins want me to do Aryas sculpted lip curled with disgust Something not even they can accomplish It is possible to speak the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its true form It takes years of work and great discipline but the reward is complete control over the object That is why ones true name is always kept hidden for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts they could dominate you utterly Its strange said Eragon after a moment but before I was captured at Gilead I had visions of you in my dreams It was like scryingand I was able to scry you laterbut it was always during my sleep Arya pursed her lips pensively There were times I felt as if another presence was watching me but I was often confused and feverish Ive never heard of anyone either in lore or legend being able to scry in their sleep I dont understand it myself said Eragon looking at his hands He twirled Broms ring around his finger What does the tattoo on your shoulder mean I didnt mean to see it but when I was healing your wounds it couldnt be helped Its just like the symbol on this ring You have a ring with the yawë on it she asked sharply Yes It was Broms See He held out the ring Arya examined the sapphire then said This is a token given only to the most valued elffriendsso valued in fact it has not been used in centuries Or so I thought I never knew that Queen Islanzadi thought so highly of Brom I shouldnt wear it then said Eragon afraid that he had been presumptuous No keep it It will give you protection if you meet my people by chance and it may help you gain favor with the queen Tell no one of my tattoo It should not be revealed Very well He enjoyed talking with Arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer When they parted he wandered through Farthen Dûr conversing with Saphira Despite his prodding she refused to tell him what Arya had said to her Eventually his thoughts turned to Murtagh and then to Nasuadas adviceIll get something to eat then go see him he decidedWill you wait for me so I can return to the dragonhold with you I will waitgosaid Saphira With a grateful smile Eragon dashed to Tronjheim ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen then followed Nasuadas instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a man and a dwarf When he requested entrance the dwarf banged on the door three times then unbolted it Just holler when you want to leave said the man with a friendly smile The cell was warm and well lit with a washbasin in one corner and a writing deskequipped with quills and inkin another The ceiling was extensively carved with lacquered figures the floor was covered with a plush rug Murtagh lay on a stout bed reading a scroll He looked up in surprise and exclaimed cheerily Eragon Id hoped you would come How did I mean I thought You thought I was stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack said Murtagh rolling upright with a grin Actually I expected the same thing but Ajihad lets me have all this as long as I dont cause trouble And they bring me huge meals as well as anything I want from the library If Im not careful Ill turn into a fat scholar Eragon laughed and with a wondering smile seated himself next to Murtagh But arent you angry Youre still a prisoner Oh I was at first said Murtagh with a shrug But the more I thought about it the more I came to realize that this is really the best place for me Even if Ajihad gave me my freedom I would stay in my room most of the time anyway But why You know well enough No one would be at ease around me knowing my true identity and there would always be people who wouldnt limit themselves to harsh looks or words But enough of that Im eager to know whats new Come tell me Eragon recounted the events of the past two days including his encounter with the Twins in the library When he finished Murtagh leaned back reflectively I suspect he said that Arya is more important than either of us thought Consider what youve learned she is a master of the sword powerful in magic and most significantly was chosen to guard Saphiras egg She can not be ordinary even among the elves Eragon agreed Murtagh stared at the ceiling You know I find this imprisonment oddly peaceful For once in my life I dont have to be afraid I know I ought to be yet something about this place puts me at ease A good nights sleep helps too I know what you mean said Eragon wryly He moved to a softer place on the bed Nasuada said that she visited you Did she say anything interesting Murtaghs gaze shifted into the distance and he shook his head No she only wanted to meet me Doesnt she look like a princess And the way she carries herself When she first entered through that doorway I thought she was one of the great ladies of Galbatorixs court Ive seen earls and counts who had wives that compared to her were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility Eragon listened to his praise with growing apprehensionIt may mean nothing he reminded himselfYoure leaping to conclusions Yet the foreboding would not leave him Trying to shake off the feeling he asked How long are you going to remain imprisoned Murtagh You cant hide forever Murtagh shrugged carelessly but there was weight behind his words For now Im content to stay and rest Theres no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself to the Twins examination No doubt Ill tire of this eventually but for now I am content T HESHADOWS LENGTHEN Saphira woke Eragon with a sharp rap of her snout bruising him with her hard jaw Ouch he exclaimed sitting upright The cave was dark except for a faint glow emanating from the shuttered lantern Outside in the dragonhold Isidar Mithrim glittered with a thousand different colors illuminated by its girdle of lanterns An agitated dwarf stood in the entrance to the cave wringing his hands You must come Argetlam Great troubleAjihad summons you There is no time Whats wrong asked Eragon The dwarf only shook his head beard wagging Go you must Carkna bragha Now Eragon belted on Zarroc grabbed his bow and arrows then strapped the saddle onto SaphiraSo much for a good nights sleep she groused crouching low to the floor so he could clamber onto her back He yawned loudly as Saphira launched herself from the cave Orik was waiting for them with a grim expression when they landed at Tronjheims gates Come the others are waiting He led them through Tronjheim to Ajihads study On the way Eragon plied him with questions but Orik would only say I dont know enough myselfwait until you hear Ajihad The large study door was opened by a pair of burly guards Ajihad stood behind his desk bleakly inspecting a map Arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well Ajihad looked up Good youre here Eragon Meet Jörmundur my second in command They acknowledged each other then turned their attention to Ajihad I roused the five of you because we are all in grave danger About half an hour ago a dwarf ran out of an abandoned tunnel under Tronjheim He was bleeding and nearly incoherent but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what was pursuing him an army of Urgals maybe a days march from here Shocked silence filled the study Then Jörmundur swore explosively and began asking questions at the same time Orik did Arya remained silent Ajihad raised his hands Quiet There is more The Urgals arent approachingover land butunder it Theyre in the tunnels were going to be attacked from below Eragon raised his voice in the din that followed Why didnt the dwarves know about this sooner How did the Urgals find the tunnels Were lucky to know about it this early bellowed Orik Everyone stopped talking to hear him There are hundreds of tunnels throughout the Beor Mountains uninhabited since the day they were mined The only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who dont want contact with anyone We could have just as easily received no warning at all Ajihad pointed at the map and Eragon moved closer The map depicted the southern half of Alagaësia but unlike Eragons it showed the entire Beor Mountain range in detail Ajihads finger was on the section of the Beor Mountains that touched Surdas eastern border This he said is where the dwarf claimed to have come from Orthíad exclaimed Orik At Jörmundurs puzzled inquiry he explained Its an ancient dwelling of ours that was deserted when Tronjheim was completed During its time it was the greatest of our cities But no ones lived there for centuries And its old enough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed said Ajihad Thats how we surmise it was discovered from the surface I suspect that Orthíad is now being called Ithrö Zhâda Thats where the Urgal column that was chasing Eragon and Saphira was supposed to go and Im sure its where the Urgals have been migrating all year From Ithrö Zhâda they can travel anywhere they want in the Beor Mountains They have the power to destroy both the Varden and the dwarves Jörmundur bent over the map eyeing it carefully Do you know how many Urgals there are Are Galbatorixs troops with them We cant plan a defense without knowing how large their army is Ajihad replied unhappily Were unsure about both those things yet our survival rests on that last question If Galbatorix has augmented the Urgals ranks with his own men we dont stand a chance But if he hasntbecause he still doesnt want his alliance with the Urgals revealed or for some other reasonits possible we can win Neither Orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour Even so I sent runners to both of them with news of our plight At the very least they wont be caught by surprise if we fall He drew a hand across his coalblack brow Ive already talked with Hrothgar and weve decided on a course of action Our only hope is to contain the Urgals in three of the larger tunnels and channel them into Farthen Dûr so they dont swarm inside Tronjheim like locusts I need you Eragon and Arya to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels The job is too big for normal means Two groups of dwarves are already working on it one outside Tronjheim the other beneath it Eragon youre to work with the group outside Arya youll be with the one underground Orik will guide you to them Why not collapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched asked Eragon Because said Orik that would force the Urgals to clear away the rubble and they might decide to go in a direction we dont want them to Plus if we cut ourselves off they could attack other dwarf citieswhich we wouldnt be able to assist in time Theres also another reason said Ajihad Hrothgar warned me that Tronjheim sits on such a dense network of tunnels that if too many are weakened sections of the city will sink into the ground under their own weight We cant risk that Jörmundur listened intently then asked So there wont be any fighting inside Tronjheim You said the Urgals would be channeled outside the city into Farthen Dûr Ajihad responded quickly Thats right We cant defend Tronjheims entire perimeterits too big for our forcesso were going to seal all the passageways and gates leading into it That will force the Urgals out onto the flats surrounding Tronjheim where theres plenty of maneuvering room for our armies Since the Urgals have access to the tunnels we can not risk an extended battle As long as they are here we will be in constant danger of them quarrying up through Tronjheims floor If that happens well be trapped attacked from both the outside and inside We have to prevent the Urgals from taking Tronjheim If they secure it its doubtful we will have the strength to roust them And what of our families asked Jörmundur I wont see my wife and son murdered by Urgals The lines deepened on Ajihads face All the women and children are being evacuated into the surrounding valleys If we are defeated they have guides who will take them to Surda Thats all I can do under the circumstances Jörmundur struggled to hide his relief Sir is Nasuada going as well She is not pleased but yes All eyes were on Ajihad as he squared his shoulders and announced The Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours We know their numbers are great but wemust hold Farthen Dûr Failure will mean the dwarves downfall death to the Vardenand eventual defeat for Surda and the elves This is one battle we can not lose Now go and complete your tasks Jörmundur ready the men to fight They left the study and scattered Jörmundur to the barracks Orik and Arya to the stairs leading underground and Eragon and Saphira down one of Tronjheims four main halls Despite the early hour the citymountain swarmed like an anthill People were running shouting messages and carrying bundles of belongings Eragon had fought and killed before but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear into his chest He had never had a chance to anticipate a fight Now that he did it filled him with dread He was confident when facing only a few opponentshe knew he could easily defeat three or four Urgals with Zarroc and magicbut in a large conflict anything could happen They exited Tronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help Without the sun or moon the inside of Farthen Dûr was dark as lampblack punctuated by glittering lanterns bobbing jerkily in the craterPerhaps theyre on the far side of Tronjheim suggested Saphira Eragon agreed and swung onto her back They glided around Tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight Saphira angled toward them then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled dwarves who were busy digging with pickaxes Eragon quickly explained why he was there A sharpnosed dwarf told him Theres a tunnel about four yards directly underneath us Any help you could give us would be appreciated If you clear the area over the tunnel Ill see what I can do The sharpnosed dwarf looked doubtful but ordered the diggers off the site Breathing slowly Eragon prepared to use magic It might be possible to actually move all the dirt off the tunnel but he needed to conserve his strength for later Instead he would try to collapse the tunnel by applying force to weak sections of its ceiling Thrysta deloi he whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil Almost immediately they encountered rock He ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the hollow emptiness of the tunnel Then he began searching for flaws in the rock Every time he found one he pushed on it elongating and widening it It was strenuous work but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand He made no visible progressa fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves Eragon persevered Before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be heard clearly on the surface There was a persistent screech then the ground slid inward like water draining from a tub leaving a gaping hole seven yards across As the delighted dwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble the sharpnosed dwarf led Eragon to the next tunnel This one was much more difficult to collapse but he managed to duplicate the feat Over the next few hours he collapsed over a halfdozen tunnels throughout Farthen Dûr with Saphiras help Light crept into the small patch of sky above them as he worked It was not enough to see by but it bolstered Eragons confidence He turned away from the crumpled ruins of the latest tunnel and surveyed the land with interest A mass exodus of women and children along with the Vardens elders streamed out of Tronjheim Everyone carried loads of provisions clothes and belongings A small group of warriors predominantly boys and old men accompanied them Most of the activity however was at the base of Tronjheim where the Varden and dwarves were assembling their army which was divided into three battalions Each section bore the Vardens standard a white dragon holding a rose above a sword pointing downward on a purple field The men were silent ironfisted Their hair flowed loosely from under their helmets Many warriors had only a sword and a shield but there were several ranks of spear and pikemen In the rear of the battalions archers tested their bowstrings The dwarves were garbed in heavy battle gear Burnished steel hauberks hung to their knees and thick roundshields stamped with the crests of their clan rested on their left arms Short swords were sheathed at their waists while in their right hands they carried mattocks or war axes Their legs were covered with extrafine mail They wore iron caps and brassstudded boots A small figure detached itself from the far battalion and hurried toward Eragon and Saphira It was Orik clad like the other dwarves Ajihad wants you to join the army he said There are no more tunnels to cave in Food is waiting for both of you Eragon and Saphira accompanied Orik to a tent where they found bread and water for Eragon and a pile of dried meat for Saphira They ate it without complaint it was better than going hungry When they finished Orik told them to wait and disappeared into the battalions ranks He returned leading a line of dwarves burdened with tall piles of plate armor Orik lifted a section of it and handed it to Eragon What is this asked Eragon fingering the polished metal The armor was intricately wrought with engraving and gold filigree It was an inch thick in places and very heavy No man could fight under that much weight And there were far too many pieces for one person A gift from Hrothgar said Orik looking pleased with himself It has lain so long among our other treasures that it was almost forgotten It was forged in another age before the fall of the Riders But whats itfor asked Eragon Why its dragon armor of course You dont think that dragons went into battle unprotected Complete sets are rare because they took so long to make and because dragons were always growing Still Saphira isnt too big yet so this should fit her reasonably well Dragon armorAs Saphira nosed one of the pieces Eragon askedWhat do you think Lets try it onshe said a fierce gleam in her eye After a good deal of struggling Eragon and Orik stepped back to admire the result Saphiras entire neckexcept for the spikes along its ridgewas covered with triangular scales of overlapping armor Her belly and chest were protected by the heaviest plates while the lightest ones were on her tail Her legs and back were completely encased Her wings were left bare A single molded plate lay on top of her head leaving her lower jaw free to bite and snap Saphira arched her neck experimentally and the armor flexed smoothly with herThis will slow me down but itll help stop the arrows How do I look Very intimidatingreplied Eragon truthfully That pleased her Orik picked up the remaining items from the ground I brought you armor as well though it took much searching to find your size We rarely forge arms for men or elves I dont know who this was made for but it has never been used and should serve you well Over Eragons head went a stiff shirt of leatherbacked mail that fell to his knees like a skirt It rested heavily on his shoulders and clinked when he moved He belted Zarroc over it which helped keep the mail from swinging On his head went a leather cap then a mail coif and finally a goldandsilver helm Bracers were strapped to his forearms and greaves to his lower legs For his hands there were mailbacked gloves Last Orik handed him a broad shield emblazoned with an oak tree Knowing that what he and Saphira had been given was worth several fortunes Eragon bowed and said Thank you for these gifts Hrothgars presents are greatly appreciated Dont give thanks now said Orik with a chuckle Wait until the armor saves your life The warriors around them began marching away The three battalions were repositioning themselves in different parts of Farthen Dûr Unsure of what they should do Eragon looked at Orik who shrugged and said I suppose we should accompany them They trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the crater wall Eragon asked about the Urgals but Orik only knew that scouts had been posted underground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet The battalion halted at one of the collapsed tunnels The dwarves had piled the rubble so that anyone inside the tunnel could easily climb outThis must be one of the places theyre going to force the Urgals to surface Saphira pointed out Hundreds of lanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground They provided a great pool of light that glowed like an evening sun Fires blazed along the rim of the tunnels roof huge cauldrons of pitch heating over them Eragon looked away fighting back revulsion It was a terrible way to kill anyone even an Urgal Rows of sharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny barrier between the battalion and the tunnel Eragon saw an opportunity to help and joined a group of men digging trenches between the saplings Saphira assisted as well scooping out the dirt with her giant claws While they labored Orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the archers Eragon drank gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed around After the trenches were finished and filled with pointed stakes Saphira and Eragon rested Orik returned to find them seated together He wiped his brow All the men and dwarves are on the battlefield Tronjheim has been sealed off Hrothgar has taken charge of the battalion to our left Ajihad leads the one ahead of us Who commands this one Jörmundur Orik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground Saphira nudged EragonLook His hand tightened on Zarroc as he saw Murtagh helmed carrying a dwarven shield and his handandahalf sword approaching with Tornac Orik cursed and leapt to his feet but Murtagh said quickly Its all right Ajihad released me Why would he do that demanded Orik Murtagh smiled wryly He said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions Apparently he doesnt think I would be able to do much damage even if I did turn on the Varden Eragon nodded in welcome relaxing his grip Murtagh was an excellent and merciless fighterexactly whom Eragon wanted by his side during battle How do we know youre not lying asked Orik Because I say so announced a firm voice Ajihad strode into their midst armed for battle with a breastplate and an ivoryhandled sword He put a strong hand on Eragons shoulder and drew him away where the others could not hear He cast an eye over Eragons armor Good Orik outfitted you Yes has anything been seen in the tunnels Nothing Ajihad leaned on his sword One of the Twins is staying in Tronjheim Hes going to watch the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his brother to me I know you can speak with your mind I need you to tell the Twins anythinganything unusual that you see while fighting Also Ill relay orders to you through them Do you understand The thought of being linked to the Twins filled Eragon with loathing but he knew it was necessary I do Ajihad paused Youre not a foot soldier or horseman nor any other type of warrior Im used to commanding Battle may prove differently but I think you and Saphira will be safer on the ground In the air youll be a choice target for Urgal archers Will you fight from Saphiras back Eragon had never been in combat on horseback much less on Saphira Im not sure what well do When Im on Saphira Im up too high to fight all but a Kull There will be plenty of Kull Im afraid said Ajihad He straightened pulling his sword out of the ground The only advice I can give you is to avoid unnecessary risks The Varden can not afford to lose you With that he turned and left Eragon returned to Orik and Murtagh and hunkered next to Saphira leaning his shield against his knees The four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors around them Light from Farthen Dûrs opening waned as the sun crept below the crater rim Eragon turned to scan the encampment and froze heart jolting About thirty feet away sat Arya with her bow in her lap Though he knew it was unreasonable he had hoped she might accompany the other women out of Farthen Dûr Concerned he hastened to her You will fight I do what I must Arya said calmly But its too dangerous Her face darkened Do not pamper me human Elves train both their men and women to fight I am not one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is danger I was given the task of protecting Saphiras egg which I failed My breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if I did not guard you and Saphira on this field You forget that I am stronger with magic than any here including you If the Shade comes who can defeat him but me And who else has the right Eragon stared at her helplessly knowing she was right and hating the fact Then stay safe Out of desperation he added in the ancient language Wiol pömnuria ilian For my happiness Arya turned her gaze away uneasily the fringe of her hair obscuring her face She ran a hand along her polished bow then murmured It is my wyrd to be here The debt must be paid He abruptly retreated to Saphira Murtagh looked at him curiously What did she say Nothing Wrapped in their own thoughts the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled by Farthen Dûrs crater again grew black except for the sanguine lantern glow and the fires heating the pitch Eragon alternated between myopically examining the links of his mail and spying on Arya Orik repeatedly ran a whetstone over the blade of his ax periodically eyeing the edge between strokes the rasp of metal on stone was irritating Murtagh just stared into the distance Occasionally messengers ran through the encampment causing the warriors to surge to their feet But it always proved to be a false alarm The men and dwarves became strained angry voices were often heard The worst part about Farthen Dûr was the lack of windthe air was dead motionless Even when it grew warm and stifling and filled with smoke there was no reprieve As the night dragged on the battlefield stilled silent as death Muscles stiffened from the waiting Eragon stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids He shook himself to alertness and tried to focus through his stupor Finally Orik said Its late We should sleep If anything happens the others will wake us Murtagh grumbled but Eragon was too tired to complain He curled up against Saphira using his shield as a pillow As his eyes closed he saw that Arya was still awake watching over them His dreams were confused and disturbing full of horned beasts and unseen menaces Over and over he heard a deep voice ask Are you ready But he never had an answer Plagued by such visions his sleep was shallow and uneasy until something touched his arm He woke with a start B ATTLEUNDER FARTHENDÛR It has begun Arya said with a sorrowful expression The troops in the encampment stood alertly with their weapons drawn Orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough room Arya nocked an arrow and held it ready to shoot A scout ran out of a tunnel a few minutes ago said Murtagh to Eragon The Urgals are coming Together they watched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened stakes A minute dragged by then another and another Without taking his eyes from the tunnel Eragon hoisted himself into Saphiras saddle Zarroc in his hand a comfortable weight Murtagh mounted Tornac beside him Then a man cried I hear them The warriors stiffened grips tightened on weapons No one moved no one breathed Somewhere a horse nickered Harsh Urgal shouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnels opening At a command the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides pouring the scalding liquid into the tunnels hungry throat The monsters howled in pain arms flailing A torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch and an orange pillar of greasy flames roared up in the opening engulfing the Urgals in an inferno Sickened Eragon looked across Farthen Dûr at the other two battalions and saw similar fires by each He sheathed Zarroc and strung his bow More Urgals soon tamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned brethren They clumped together presenting a solid wall to the men and dwarves Behind the palisade Orik had helped build the first row of archers pulled on their bows and fired Eragon and Arya added their arrows to the deadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the Urgals ranks The Urgal line wavered threatening to break but they covered themselves with their shields and weathered the attack Again the archers fired but the Urgals continued to stream onto the surface at a ferocious rate Eragon was dismayed by their numbers They were supposed to kill every single one It seemed a madmans task His only encouragement was that he saw none of Galbatorixs troops with the Urgals Not yet at least The opposing army formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly Tattered and sullen standards were raised in the monsters midst Baleful notes echoed through Farthen Dûr as war horns sounded The entire group of Urgals charged with savage war cries They dashed against the rows of stakes covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as the ranks at the vanguard were crushed against the posts A cloud of black arrows flew over the barrier at the crouched defenders Eragon ducked behind his shield and Saphira covered her head Arrows rattled harmlessly against her armor Momentarily foiled by the pickets the Urgal horde milled with confusion The Varden bunched together waiting for the next attack After a pause the war cries were raised again as the Urgals surged forward The assault was bitter Its momentum carried the Urgals through the stakes where a line of pikemen jabbed frantically at their ranks trying to repel them The pikemen held briefly but the ominous tide of Urgals could not be halted and they were overwhelmed The first lines of defense breached the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first time A deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the conflict Saphira bellowed and leapt toward the fight diving into a whirlwind of noise and blurred action With her jaws and talons Saphira tore through an Urgal Her teeth were as lethal as any sword her tail a giant mace From her back Eragon parried a hammer blow from an Urgal chief protecting her vulnerable wings Zarrocs crimson blade seemed to gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length From the corner of his eye Eragon saw Orik hewing Urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax Beside the dwarf was Murtagh on Tornac his face disfigured by a vicious snarl as he swung his sword angrily cutting through every defense Then Saphira spun around and Eragon saw Arya leap past the lifeless body of an opponent An Urgal bowled over a wounded dwarf and hacked at Saphiras front right leg His sword skated off her armor with a burst of sparks Eragon smote him on the head but Zarroc stuck in the monsters horns and was yanked from his grasp With a curse he dived off Saphira and tackled the Urgal smashing his face with the shield He jerked Zarroc out of the horns then dodged as another Urgal charged him Saphira I need youhe shouted but the battles tide had separated them Suddenly a Kull jumped at him club raised for a blow Unable to lift his shield in time Eragon uttered Jierda The Kulls head snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke Four more Urgals succumbed to Zarrocs thirsty bite then Murtagh rode up beside Eragon driving the press of Urgals backward Come on he shouted and reached down from Tornac pulling Eragon onto the horse They rushed toward Saphira who was embroiled in a mass of enemies Twelve spearwielding Urgals encircled her needling her with their lances They had already managed to prick both of her wings Her blood splattered the ground Every time she rushed at one of the Urgals they bunched together and jabbed at her eyes forcing her to retreat She tried to sweep the spears away with her talons but the Urgals jumped back and evaded her The sight of Saphiras blood enraged Eragon He swung off Tornac with a wild cry and stabbed the nearest Urgal through the chest withholding nothing in his frenzied attempt to help Saphira His attack provided the distraction she needed to break free With a kick she sent an Urgal flying then barreled to him Eragon grabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle Murtagh raised his hand then charged into another knot of Urgals By unspoken consent Saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies seeking a respite from the madness Eragons breath trembled His muscles were clenched ready to ward off the next attack Every fiber of his being thrilled with energy making him feel more alive than ever before Saphira circled long enough for them to recover their strength then descended toward the Urgals skimming the ground to avoid detection She approached the monsters from behind where their archers were gathered Before the Urgals realized what was happening Eragon lopped off the heads of two archers and Saphira disemboweled three others She took off again as alarms sounded quickly soaring out of bow range They repeated the tactic on a different flank of the army Saphiras stealth and speed combined with the dim lighting made it nearly impossible for the Urgals to predict where she would strike next Eragon used his bow whenever Saphira was in the air but he quickly ran out of arrows Soon the only thing left in his quiver was magic which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately needed Saphiras flights over the combatants gave Eragon a unique understanding of how the battle was progressing There were three separate fights raging in Farthen Dûr one by each open tunnel The Urgals were disadvantaged by the dispersal of their forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the tunnels at once Even so the Varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from advancing and were slowly being driven back toward Tronjheim The defenders seemed insignificant against the mass of Urgals whose numbers continued to increase as they poured out of the tunnels The Urgals had organized themselves around several standards each representing a clan but it was unclear who commanded them overall The clans paid no attention to each other as if they were receiving orders from elsewhere Eragon wished he knew who was in charge so he and Saphira could kill him Remembering Ajihads orders he began relaying information to the Twins They were interested by what he had to say about the Urgals apparent lack of a leader and questioned him closely The exchange was smooth if brief The Twins told himYoure ordered to assist Hrothgar the fight goes badly for him UnderstoodEragon responded Saphira swiftly flew to the besieged dwarves swooping low over Hrothgar Arrayed in golden armor the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin wielding Volund the hammer of his ancestors His white beard caught the lantern light as he looked up at Saphira Admiration glinted in his eyes Saphira landed beside the dwarves and faced the oncoming Urgals Even the bravest Kull quailed before her ferocity allowing the dwarves to surge forward Eragon tried to keep Saphira safe Her left flank was protected by the dwarves but to her front and right raged a sea of enemies He showed no mercy on those and took every advantage he could using magic whenever Zarroc could not serve him A spear bounced off his shield denting it and leaving him with a bruised shoulder Shaking off the pain he cleaved open an Urgals skull mixing brains with metal and bone He was in awe of Hrothgarwho though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves was still undiminished on the battlefield No Urgal Kull or not could stand before the dwarf king and his guards and live Every time Volund struck it sounded the gong of death for another enemy After a spear downed one of his warriors Hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and with astounding strength hurled it completely through its owner twenty yards away Such heroism emboldened Eragon to ever greater risks seeking to hold his own with the mighty king Eragon lunged at a giant Kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from Saphiras saddle Before he could recover the Kull darted past Saphiras defenses and swung his sword The brunt of the blow caught Eragon on the side of his helm throwing him backward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring thunderously Stunned he tried to pull himself upright but the Kull had already prepared for another blow As the Kulls arm descended a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from his chest Howling the monster toppled to the side In his place stood Angela The witch wore a long red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green She bore a strange twohanded weapona long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to each end Angela winked at Eragon mischievously then dashed away spinning her staffsword like a dervish Close behind her was Solembum in the form of a young shaggyhaired boy He held a small black dagger sharp teeth bared in a feral snarl Still dazed from his battering Eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle Saphira jumped into the air and wheeled high above letting him recuperate He scanned Farthen Dûrs plains and saw to his dismay that all three battles were going badly Neither Ajihad Jörmundur nor Hrothgar could stop the Urgals There were simply too many Eragon wondered how many Urgals he could kill at once with magic He knew his limits fairly well If he were to kill enough to make a difference it would probably be suicide That might be what it took to win The fighting continued for one endless hour after another The Varden and dwarves were exhausted but the Urgals remained fresh with reinforcements It was a nightmare for Eragon Though he and Saphira fought their hardest there was always another Urgal to take the place of the one just killed His whole body hurtespecially his head Every time he used magic he lost a little more energy Saphira was in better condition though her wings were punctured with small wounds As he parried a blow the Twins contacted him urgentlyThere are loud noises under Tronjheim It sounds like Urgals are trying to dig into the city We need you and Arya to collapse any tunnels theyre excavating Eragon dispatched his opponent with a sword thrustWell be right there He looked for Arya and saw her engaged with a knot of struggling Urgals Saphira quickly forged a path to the elf leaving a pile of crumpled bodies in her wake Eragon extended his hand and said Get on Arya jumped onto Saphiras back without hesitation She wrapped her right arm around Eragons waist wielding her bloodstained sword with the other As Saphira crouched to take off an Urgal ran at her howling then lifted an ax and smashed her in the chest Saphira roared with pain and lurched forward feet leaving the ground Her wings snapped open straining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side right wingtip scraping the ground Below them the Urgal pulled back his arm to throw the ax But Arya raised her palm shouting and an emerald ball of energy shot from her hand killing the Urgal With a colossal heave of her shoulders Saphira righted herself barely making it over the heads of the warriors She pulled away from the battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath Are you all rightasked Eragon concerned He could not see where she had been struck Ill liveshe said grimlybut the front of my armor has been crushed togetherIt hurts my chest and Im having trouble moving Can you get us to the dragonhold Well see Eragon explained Saphiras condition to Arya Ill stay and help Saphira when we land she offered Once she is free of the armor I will join you Thank you he said The flight was laborious for Saphira she glided whenever she could When they reached the dragonhold she dropped heavily to Isidar Mithrim where the Twins were supposed to be watching the battle but it was empty Eragon jumped to the floor and winced as he saw the damage the Urgal had done Four of the metal plates on Saphiras chest had been hammered together restricting her ability to bend and breathe Stay well he said putting a hand on her side then ran out the archway He stopped and swore He was at the top of Vol Turin The Endless Staircase Because of his worry for Saphira he had not considered how he would get to Tronjheims basewhere the Urgals were breaking in There was no time to climb down He looked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs then grabbed one of the leather pads and threw himself down on it The stone slide was smooth as lacquered wood With the leather underneath him he accelerated almost instantly to a frightening speed the walls blurring and the curve of the slide pressing him high against the wall Eragon lay completely flat so he would go faster The air rushed past his helm making it vibrate like a weather vane in a gale The trough was too confined for him and he was perilously close to flying out but as long as he kept his arms and legs still he was safe It was a swift descent but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom The slide leveled out at the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge carnelian floor When he finally came to a stop he was too dizzy to walk His first attempt to stand made him nauseated so he curled up head in his hands and waited for things to stop spinning When he felt better he stood and warily looked around The great chamber was completely deserted the silence unsettling Rosy light filtered down from Isidar Mithrim He falteredWhere was he supposed to goand cast out his mind for the Twins Nothing He froze as loud knocking echoed through Tronjheim An explosion split the air A long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet up Needles of rocks flew outward as it crashed down Eragon stumbled back stunned groping for Zarroc The twisted shapes of Urgals clambered out of the hole in the floor Eragon hesitated Should he flee Or should he stay and try to close the tunnel Even if he managed to seal it before the Urgals attacked him what if Tronjheim was already breached elsewhere He could not find all the places in time to prevent the citymountain from being capturedBut if I run to one of Tronjheims gates and blast it open the Varden could retake Tronjheim without having to siege it Before he could decide a tall man garbed entirely in black armor emerged from the tunnel and looked directly at him It was Durza The Shade carried his pale blade marked with the scratch from Ajihad A black roundshield with a crimson ensign rested on his arm His dark helmet was richly decorated like a generals and a long snakeskin cloak billowed around him Madness burned in his maroon eyes the madness of one who enjoys power and finds himself in the position to use it Eragon knew he was neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him He immediately warned Saphira though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue him He dropped into a crouch and quickly reviewed what Brom had told him about fighting another magic user It was not encouraging And Ajihad had said that Shades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart Durza gazed at him contemptuously and said Kaz jtierl trazhid Otrag bagh The Urgals eyed Eragon suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room Durza slowly approached Eragon with a triumphant expression So my young Rider we meet again You were foolish to escape from me in Gilead It will only make things worse for you in the end Youll never capture me alive growled Eragon Is that so asked the Shade raising an eyebrow The light from the star sapphire gave his skin a ghastly tint I dont see your friend Murtagh around to help you You cant stop me now No one can Fear touched EragonHow does he know about Murtagh Putting all the derision he could into his voice he jeered How did you like being shot Durzas face tightened momentarily I will be repaid in blood for that Now tell me where your dragon is hiding Never The Shades countenance darkened Then I will force it from you His sword whistled through the air The moment Eragon caught the blade on his shield a mental probe spiked deep into his thoughts Fighting to protect his consciousness he shoved Durza back and attacked with his own mind Eragon battered with all his strength against the ironhard defenses surrounding Durzas mind but to no avail He swung Zarroc trying to catch Durza off guard The Shade knocked the blow aside effortlessly then stabbed in return with lightning speed The point of the sword caught Eragon in the ribs piercing his mail and driving out his breath The mail slipped though and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire The distraction was all Durza needed to break into Eragons mind and begin taking control No cried Eragon throwing himself at the Shade His face contorted as he grappled with Durza yanking on his sword arm Durza tried to cut Eragons hand but it was protected by the mailbacked glove which sent the blade glancing downward As Eragon kicked his leg Durza snarled and swept his black shield around knocking him to the floor Eragon tasted blood in his mouth his neck throbbed Ignoring his injuries he rolled over and hurled his shield at Durza Despite the Shades superior speed the heavy shield clipped him on the hip As Durza stumbled Eragon caught him on the upper arm with Zarroc A line of blood traced down the Shades arm Eragon thrust at the Shade with his mind and drove through Durzas weakened defenses A flood of images suddenly engulfed him rushing through his consciousness Durza as a young boy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains The tribe abandoned them and called his father oathbreaker Only it was not Durza then but Carsaibthe name his mother crooned while combing his hair The Shade reeled wildly face twisted in pain Eragon tried to control the torrent of memories but the force of them was overwhelming Standing on a hill over the graves of his parents weeping that the men had not killed him as well Then turning and stumbling blindly away into the desert Durza faced Eragon Terrible hatred flowed from his maroon eyes Eragon was on one kneealmost standingstruggling to seal his mind How the old man looked when he first saw Carsaib lying near death on a sand dune The days it had taken Carsaib to recover and the fear he felt upon discovering that his rescuer was a sorcerer How he had pleaded to be taught the control of spirits How Haeg had finally agreed Called him Desert Rat Eragon was standing now Durza charged sword raised shield ignored in his fury The days spent training under the scorching sun always alert for the lizards they caught for food How his power slowly grew giving him pride and confidence The weeks spent nursing his sick master after a failed spell His joy when Haeg recovered There was not enough time to react not enough time The bandits who attacked during the night killing Haeg The rage Carsaib had felt and the spirits he had summoned for vengeance But the spirits were stronger than he expected They turned on him possessing mind and body He had screamed He wasI AM DURZA The sword smote heavily across Eragons back cutting through both mail and skin He screamed as pain blasted through him forcing him to his knees Agony bowed his body in half and obliterated all thought He swayed barely conscious hot blood running down the small of his back Durza said something he could not hear In anguish Eragon raised his eyes to the heavens tears streaming down his cheeks Everything had failed The Varden and dwarves were destroyed He was defeated Saphira would give herself up for his sakeshe had done it beforeand Arya would be recaptured or killed Why had it ended like this What justice could this be All was for nothing As he looked at Isidar Mithrim far above his tortured frame a flash of light erupted in his eyes blinding him A second later the chamber rang with a deafening report Then his eyes cleared and he gaped with disbelief The star sapphire had shattered An expanding torus of huge daggerlike pieces plummeted toward the distant floorthe shimmering shards near the walls In the center of the chamber hurtling downward headfirst was Saphira Her jaws were open and from between them erupted a great tongue of flame bright yellow and tinged with blue On her back was Arya hair billowing wildly arm uplifted palm glowing with a nimbus of green magic Time seemed to slow as Eragon saw Durza tilt his head toward the ceiling First shock then anger contorted the Shades face Sneering defiantly he raised his hand and pointed at Saphira a word forming on his lips A hidden reserve of strength suddenly welled up inside Eragon dredged from the deepest part of his being His fingers curled around the hilt of his sword He plunged through the barrier in his mind and took hold of the magic All his pain and rage focused on one word Brisingr Zarroc blazed with bloody light heatless flames running along it He lunged forward And stabbed Durza in the heart Durza looked down with shock at the blade protruding from his breast His mouth was open but instead of words an unearthly howl burst from him His sword dropped from nerveless fingers He grasped Zarroc as if to pull it out but it was lodged firmly in him Then Durzas skin turned transparent Under it was neither flesh nor bone but swirling patterns of darkness He shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated splitting his skin With one last cry Durza was rent from head to toe releasing the darkness which separated into three entities who flew through Tronjheims walls and out of Farthen Dûr The Shade was gone Bereft of strength Eragon fell back with arms outstretched Above him Saphira and Arya had nearly reached the floorit looked as if they were going to smash into it with the deadly remains of Isidar Mithrim As his sight faded Saphira Arya the myriad fragmentsall seemed to stop falling and hang motionless in the air T HEMOURNINGSAGE S natches of the Shades memories continued to flash through Eragon A whirlwind of dark events and emotions overwhelmed him making it impossible to think Submerged in the maelstrom he knew neither who nor where he was He was too weak to cleanse himself of the alien presence that clouded his mind Violent cruel images from the Shades past exploded behind his eyes until his spirit cried out in anguish at the bloody sights A pile of bodies rose before him innocents slaughtered by the Shades orders He saw still more corpseswhole villages of themtaken from life by the sorcerers hand or word There was no escape from the carnage that surrounded him He wavered like a candle flame unable to withstand the tide of evil He prayed for someone to lift him out of the nightmare but there was no one to guide him If only he could remember what he was supposed to be boy or man villain or hero Shade or Rider all was jumbled together in a meaningless frenzy He was lost completely and utterly in the roiling mass Suddenly a cluster of his own memories burst through the dismal cloud left by the Shades malevolent mind All the events since he had found Saphiras egg came to him in the cold light of revelation His accomplishments and failures were displayed equally He had lost much that was dear to him yet fate had given him rare and great gifts for the first time he was proud of simply who he was As if in response to his brief selfconfidence the Shades smothering blackness assaulted him anew His identity trailed into the void as uncertainty and fear consumed his perceptions Who was he to think he could challenge the powers of Alagaësia and live He fought against the Shades sinister thoughts weakly at first then more strongly He whispered words of the ancient language and found they gave him enough strength to withstand the shadow blurring his mind Though his defenses faltered dangerously he slowly began to draw his shattered consciousness into a small bright shell around his core Outside his mind he was aware of a pain so great it threatened to blot out his very life but somethingor someoneseemed to keep it at bay He was still too weak to clear his mind completely but he was lucid enough to examine his experiences since Carvahall Where would he go now and who would show him the way Without Brom there was no one to guide or teach him Come to me He recoiled at the touch of another consciousnessone so vast and powerful it was like a mountain looming over him This was who was blocking the pain he realized Like Aryas mind music ran through this one deep ambergold chords that throbbed with magisterial melancholy Finally he dared askWho who are you One who would helpWith a flicker of an unspoken thought the Shades influence was brushed aside like an unwanted cobweb Freed from the oppressive weight Eragon let his mind expand until he touched a barrier beyond which he could not passI have protected you as best I can but you are so far away I can do no more than shield your sanity from the pain AgainWho are you to do this There was a low rumbleI am Osthato Chetowä the Mourning Sage And Togira Ikonoka the Cripple Who Is Whole Come to me Eragon for I have answers to all you ask You will not be safe until you find me But how can I find you if I dont know where you arehe asked despairing Trust Arya and go with her to EllesméraI will be there I have waited many seasons so do not delay or it may soon be too late You are greater than you know Eragon Think of what you have done and rejoice for you have rid the land of a great evil You have wrought a deed no one else could Many are in your debt The stranger was right what he had accomplished was worthy of honor of recognition No matter what his trials might be in the future he was no longer just a pawn in the game of power He had transcended that and was something else something more He had become what Ajihad wanted an authority independent of any king or leader He sensed approval as he reached that conclusionYou are learningsaid the Mourning Sage drawing nearer A vision passed from him to Eragon a burst of color blossomed in his mind resolving into a stooped figure dressed in white standing on a sundrenched stone cliffIt is time for you to rest Eragon When you wake do not speak of me to anyonesaid the figure kindly face obscured by a silver nimbus Remember you must go to the elves Now sleep He raised a hand as if in benediction and peace crept through Eragon His last thought was that Brom would have been proud of him Wake commanded the voice Awake Eragon for you have slept far too long He stirred unwillingly loath to listen The warmth that surrounded him was too comfortable to leave The voice sounded again Rise Argetlam You are needed He reluctantly forced his eyes open and found himself on a long bed swathed in soft blankets Angela sat in a chair beside him staring at his face intently How do you feel she asked Disoriented and confused he let his eyes roam over the small room I I dont know he said his mouth dry and sore Then dont move You should conserve your strength said Angela running a hand through her curly hair Eragon saw that she still wore her flanged armor Why was that A fit of coughing made him dizzy lightheaded and ache all over His feverish limbs felt heavy Angela lifted a gilt horn from the floor and held it to his lips Here drink Cool mead ran down his throat refreshing him Warmth bloomed in his stomach and rose to his cheeks He coughed again which worsened his throbbing head How did I get here There was a battle we were losing then Durza and Saphira he exclaimed sitting upright He sagged back as his head swam and clenched his eyes feeling sick What about Saphira Is she all right The Urgals were winning she was falling And Arya They lived assured Angela and have been waiting for you to wake Do you wish to see them He nodded feebly Angela got up and threw open the door Arya and Murtagh filed inside Saphira snaked her head into the room after them her body too big to fit through the doorway Her chest vibrated as she hummed deeply eyes sparkling Smiling Eragon touched her thoughts with relief and gratitudeIt is good to see you well little one she said tenderly And you too but how The others want to explain it so I will let them You breathed fireI saw you Yesshe said with pride He smiled weakly still confused then looked at Arya and Murtagh Both of them were bandaged Arya on her arm Murtagh around his head Murtagh grinned widely About time you were up Weve been sitting in the hall for hours What what happened asked Eragon Arya looked sad But Murtagh crowed We won It was incredible When the Shades spiritsif thats what they wereflew across Farthen Dûr the Urgals ceased fighting to watch them go It was as though they were released from a spell then because their clans suddenly turned and attacked each other Their entire army disintegrated within minutes We routed them after that Theyre all dead asked Eragon Murtagh shook his head No many of them escaped into the tunnels The Varden and dwarves are busy ferreting them out right now but its going to take a while I was helping until an Urgal banged me on the head and I was sent back here They arent going to lock you up again His face grew sober No one really cares about that right now A lot of Varden and dwarves were killed the survivors are busy trying to recover from the battle But at least you have cause to be happy Youre a hero Everyones talking about how you killed Durza If it hadnt been for you we would have lost Eragon was troubled by his words but pushed them away for later consideration Where were the Twins They werent where they were supposed to beI couldnt contact them I needed their help Murtagh shrugged I was told they bravely fought off a group of Urgals that broke into Tronjheim somewhere else They were probably too busy to talk with you That seemed wrong for some reason but Eragon could not decide why He turned to Arya Her large bright eyes had been fixed upon him the entire time How come you didnt crash You and Saphira were His voice trailed off She said slowly When you warned Saphira of Durza I was still trying to remove her damaged armor By the time it was off it was too late to slide down Vol Turinyou would have been captured before I reached the bottom Besides Durza would have killed you before letting me rescue you Regret entered her voice So I did the one thing I could to distract him I broke the star sapphire And I carried her downadded Saphira Eragon struggled to understand as another bout of lightheadedness made him close his eyes But why didnt any of the pieces hit you or me I didnt allow them to When we were almost to the floor I held them motionless in the air then slowly lowered them to the floorelse they would have shattered into a thousand pieces and killed you stated Arya simply Her words betrayed the power within her Angela added sourly Yes and it almost killed you as well Its taken all of my skill to keep the two of you alive A twinge of unease shot through Eragon matching the intensity of his throbbing headMy back But he felt no bandages there How long have I been here he asked with trepidation Only a day and a half answered Angela Youre lucky I was around otherwise it wouldve taken you weeks to healif you had even lived Alarmed Eragon pushed the blankets off his torso and twisted around to feel his back Angela caught his wrist with her small hand worry reflected in her eyes Eragon you have to understand my power is not like yours or Aryas It depends on the use of herbs and potions There are limits to what I can do especially with such a large He yanked his hand out of her grip and reached back fingers groping The skin on his back was smooth and warm flawless Hard muscles flexed under his fingertips as he moved He slid his hand toward the base of his neck and unexpectedly felt a hard bump about a halfinch wide He followed it down his back with growing horror Durzas blow had left him with a huge ropy scar stretching from his right shoulder to the opposite hip Pity showed on Aryas face as she murmured You have paid a terrible price for your deed Eragon Shadeslayer Murtagh laughed harshly Yes Now youre just like me Dismay filled Eragon and he closed his eyes He was disfigured Then he remembered something from when he was unconscious a figure in white who had helped him A cripple who was wholeTogira Ikonoka He had saidThink of what you have done and rejoice for you have rid the land of a great evil You have wrought a deed no one else could Many are in your debt Come to me Eragon for I have answers to all you ask A measure of peace and satisfaction consoled Eragon I will come END OFBOOKONE THE STORY WILL CONTINUE IN Eldest BOOKTWO

schools bookstores and libraries My mother and I arranged all the events At first I had only one or two appearances per month but as we became more efficient at scheduling our homemade book tour
