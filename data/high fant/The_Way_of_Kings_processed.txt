THE WAY OF KINGS TOR BOOKS BY BRANDON SANDERSON Warbreaker The Mistborn Trilogy Mistborn The Well of Ascension The Hero of Ages Elantris BRANDON SANDERSON THE WAY OF KINGS Book One of THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE A TOM DOHERTY ASSOCIATES BOOK NEW YORK For Emily Who is too patient Too kindly And too wonderful For words But I try anyway ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I finished the first draft of The Way of Kings in 2003 but I started working on pieces of the book back in the late 90s Threads of this novel go back even further in my brain No book of mine has spent longer simmering Ive spent more than a decade building this novel And so it should be no surprise that a lot of people have helped me with it Its going to be impossible to mention them all my memory simply isnt that good However there are some major players that I would like to thank most deeply First comes my wife Emily to whom this book is dedicated She gave greatly of herself to see the novel come to pass That included not only reading and giving advice on the manuscript but giving up her husband during long stretches of writing time If you readers get a chance to meet her some thanks might be in order She likes chocolate As always my excellent editor and agentMoshe Feder and Joshua Bilmesworked quite hard on this novel Moshe by special note doesnt get paid more when his authors turn in 400kword monstrosities But he edited the novel without a word of complaint his help was invaluable in turning it into the novel you now hold He also got F Paul Wilson to check over the medical scenes to their great benefit Special thanks also go to Harriet McDougal one of the greatest editors of our time who gave us a read and line edit on this novel out of the goodness of her heart Wheel of Time fans will know her as the person who discovered edited and then married Robert Jordan She doesnt do much editing these days outside of the Wheel of Time and so I feel very honored and humbled to have her input and help here Alan Romanczuk working with her should also be thanked for facilitating this edit At Tor Books Paul Stevens has been a huge help Hes been our inhouse liaison for my books and hes done an amazing job Moshe and I are lucky to have his aid Likewise Irene Gallothe art directorhas been wonderfully helpful and patient in dealing with an intrusive author who wanted to do some crazy things with the artwork in his book Many thanks to Irene Justin Golenbock Greg Collins Karl Gold Nathan Weaver Heather Saunders Meryl Gross and the entire team at Tor Books Dot Lin who was my publicist up until this books release and who is now working to put a few extra letters after her name was a wonderful help not just in publicity but in giving me advice and a cheering section over in New York Thank you all And speaking of artwork you may notice that the interior art for this book is far more extensive than what you normally find in an epic fantasy This is due to the extraordinary efforts of Greg Call Isaac Stewart and Ben McSweeney They worked hard drafting artwork numerous times to get things right Bens work on Shallans sketchbook pages is simply beautiful a melding of my best imaginings and his artistic interpretations Isaac who also did the interior artwork for the Mistborn novels went far above and beyond what should reasonably have been expected of him Late nights and demanding deadlines were the norm for this novel He is to be commended The chapter icons maps colored endpages and Navani notebook pages came from him if you are wondering As always my writing group has been an amazing help The members of it are joined by a few alpha and beta readers In no particular order these are Karen Ahlstrom Geoff and Rachel Biesinger Ethan Skarstedt Nathan Hatfield Dan Wells Kaylynn ZoBell Alan and Jeanette Layton Janci Olds Kristina Kugler Steve Diamond Brian Delambre Jason Denzel Michelle Trammel Josh Walker Chris King Austin and Adam Hussey Brian T Hill and that Ben guy whose name I cant spell right Im sure Im forgetting some of you You are all wonderful people and Id give you Shardblades if I could Whew This is turning into an epic acknowledgments But there are still a few more people that need notice The writing of these words is happening right around the one year anniversary of me hiring the Inevitable Peter Ahlstrom as my personal assistant editorial aid and extra brain If you go through previous acknowledgments pages youll always find him there Hes been a dear friend of mine and an advocate of my work for years Im lucky to now have him working for me full time He got up at three am today to get the last proofread of the book done When you next see him at a convention buy him a block of cheese I would also be remiss if I didnt thank Tom Doherty for letting me get away with writing this book Its because of Toms belief in this project that we were able to get away with the novel being so long and a personal call from Tom was what managed to get Michael Whelan to do the cover Tom has given me more here than I probably deserve this novel at the length it boasts with the number of illustrations and artwork it contains is the type that would make many publishers run away at full speed This man is the reason Tor consistently releases such awesome books Finally a moment on Michael Whelans wonderful cover For those who havent heard the story I started reading fantasy novels indeed I became a reader in the first place back as a teenager because of a beautiful Michael Whelan cover painting He has a unique ability to capture the true soul of a book in a paintingI always knew I could trust a novel with one of his covers Ive dreamed of someday having a painting of his on one of my books It seemed something I was unlikely ever to receive To finally have it happenand on the novel of my heart that Ive been working on for so longis an amazing honor CONTENTS Prelude to the Stormlight Archive Book One The Way of Kings Prologue To Kill Part One Above

of a dying thunderclast The enormous stone beast lay on its side riblike protrusions from its chest broken and cracked The monstrosity was vaguely skeletal in shape with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite shoulders The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face as if created by a fire burning deep within the stone They faded Even after all these centuries seeing a thunderclast up close made Kalak shiver The beasts hand was as long as a man was tall Hed been killed by hands like those before and it hadnt been pleasant Of course dying rarely was He rounded the creature picking his way more carefully across the battlefield The plain was a place of misshapen rock and stone natural pillars rising around him bodies littering the ground Few plants lived here The stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars Some were shattered blastedout sections where Surgebinders had fought Less frequently he passed cracked oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts had ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray Many of the bodies around him were human many were not Blood mixed Red Orange Violet Though none of the bodies around him stirred an indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air Moans of pain cries of grief They did not seem like the sounds of victory Smoke curled from the occasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses Even some sections of rock smoldered The Dustbringers had done their work well But I survived Kalak thought hand to breast as he hastened to the meeting place I actually survived this time That was dangerous When he died he was sent back no choice When he survived the Desolation he was supposed to go back as well Back to that place that he dreaded Back to that place of pain and fire What if he just decidednot to go Perilous thoughts perhaps traitorous thoughts He hastened on his way The place of meeting was in the shadow of a large rock formation a spire rising into the sky As always the ten of them had decided upon it before the battle The survivors would make their way here Oddly only one of the others was waiting for him Jezrien Had the other eight all died It was possible The battle had been so furious this time one of the worst The enemy was growing increasingly tenacious But no Kalak frowned as he stepped up to the base of the spire Seven magnificent swords stood proudly here driven pointfirst into the stone ground Each was a masterly work of art flowing in design inscribed with glyphs and patterns He recognized each one If their masters had died the Blades would have vanished These Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades These were unique Precious Jezrien stood outside the ring of swords looking eastward Jezrien The figure in white and blue glanced toward him Even after all these centuries Jezrien looked young like a man barely into his thirtieth year His short black beard was neatly trimmed though his oncefine clothing was scorched and stained with blood He folded his arms behind his back as he turned to Kalak What is this Jezrien Kalak asked Where are the others Departed Jezriens voice was calm deep regal Though he hadnt worn a crown in centuries his royal manner lingered He always seemed to know what to do You might call it a miracle Only one of us died this time Talenel Kalak said His was the only Blade unaccounted for Yes He died holding that passage by the northern waterway Kalak nodded Taln had a tendency to choose seemingly hopeless fights and win them He also had a tendency to die in the process He would be back now in the place where they went between Desolations The place of nightmares Kalak found himself shaking When had he become so weak Jezrien I cant return this time Kalak whispered the words stepping up and gripping the other mans arm I cant Kalak felt something within him break at the admission How long had it been Centuries perhaps millennia of torture It was so hard to keep track Those fires those hooks digging into his flesh anew each day Searing the skin off his arm then burning the fat then driving to the bone He could smell it Almighty he could smell it Leave your sword Jezrien said What Jezrien nodded to the ring of weapons I was chosen to wait for you We werent certain if you had survived Aa decision has been made It is time for the Oathpact to end Kalak felt a sharp stab of horror What will that do Ishar believes that so long as there is one of us still bound to the Oathpact it may be enough There is a chance we might end the cycle of Desolations Kalak looked into the immortal kings eyes Black smoke rose from a small patch to their left Groans of the dying haunted them from behind There in Jezriens eyes Kalak saw anguish and grief Perhaps even cowardice This was a man hanging from a cliff by a thread Almighty above Kalak thought Youre broken too arent you They all were Kalak turned and walked to the side where a low ridge overlooked part of the battlefield There were so many corpses and among them walked the living Men in primitive wraps carrying spears topped by bronze heads Juxtaposed between them were others in gleaming plate armor One group walked past four men in their ragged tanned skins or shoddy leather joining a powerful figure in beautiful silver plate amazingly intricate Such a contrast Jezrien stepped up beside him They see us as divinities Kalak whispered They rely upon us Jezrien Were all that they have They have the Radiants That will be enough Kalak shook his head He will not remain bound by this The enemy He will find a way around it You know he will Perhaps The king of Heralds offered no further explanation And Taln Kalak asked The flesh burning The fires The pain over and over and over Better that one man should suffer than ten Jezrien whispered He seemed so cold Like a shadow caused by heat and light falling on someone honorable and true casting this black imitation behind Jezrien walked back to the ring of swords His own Blade formed in his hands appearing from mist wet with condensation It has been decided Kalak We will go our ways and we will not seek out one another Our Blades must be left The Oathpact ends now He lifted his sword and rammed it into the stone with the other seven Jezrien hesitated looking at the sword then bowed his head and turned away As if ashamed We chose this burden willingly Well we can choose to drop it if we wish What do we tell the people Jezrien Kalak asked What will they say of this day Its simple Jezrien said walking away We tell them that they finally won Its an easy enough lie Who knows Maybe it will turn out to be true Kalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape Finally he summoned his own Blade and slammed it into the stone beside the other eight He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien And yet he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the single open spot The place where the tenth sword should have gone The one of them who was lost The one they had abandoned Forgive us Kalak thought then left Map of Alethkar and surroundings created by His Majesty Gavilar Kholins royal surveyors circa 1167 The love of men is a frigid thing a mountain stream only three steps from the ice We are his Oh Stormfatherwe are his It is but a thousand days and the Everstorm comes Collected on the first day of the week Palah of the month Shash of the year 1171 thirtyone seconds before death Subject was a darkeyed pregnant woman of middle years The child did not survive SzethsonsonVallano Truthless of Shinovar wore white on the day he was to kill a king The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition foreign to him But he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation He sat in a large stone room baked by enormous firepits that cast a garish light upon the revelers causing beads of sweat to form on their skin as they danced and drank and yelled and sang and clapped Some fell to the ground redfaced the revelry too much for them their stomachs proving to be inferior wineskins They looked as if they were dead at least until their friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds Szeth did not sway to the drums drink the sapphire wine or stand to dance He sat on a bench at the back a still servant in white robes Few at the treatysigning celebration noticed him He was just a servant and Shin were easy to ignore Most out here in the East thought Szeths kind were docile and harmless They were generally right The drummers began a new rhythm The beats shook Szeth like a quartet of thumping hearts pumping waves of invisible blood through the room Szeths masterswho were dismissed as savages by those in more civilized kingdomssat at their own tables They were men with skin of black marbled with red Parshendi they were namedcousins to the more docile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world An oddity They did not call themselves Parshendi this was the Alethi name for them It meant roughly parshmen who can think Neither side seemed to see that as an insult The Parshendi had brought the musicians At first the Alethi lighteyes had been hesitant To them drums were base instruments of the common darkeyed people But wine was the great assassin of both tradition and propriety and now the Alethi elite danced with abandon Szeth stood and began to pick his way through the room The revelry had lasted long even the king had retired hours ago But many still celebrated As he walked Szeth was forced to step around Dalinar Kholinthe kings own brotherwho slumped drunken at a small table The aging but powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage him to bed Where was Jasnah the kings daughter Elhokar the kings son and heir sat at the high table ruling the feast in his fathers absence He was in conversation with two men a darkskinned Azish man who had an odd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner Alethilooking man who kept glancing over his shoulder The heirs feasting companions were unimportant Szeth stayed far from the heir skirting the sides of the room passing the drummers Musicspren zipped through the air around them the tiny spirits taking the form of spinning translucent ribbons As Szeth passed the drummers they noted him They would withdraw soon along with all of the other Parshendi They did not seem offended They did not seem angry And yet they were going to break their treaty of only a few hours It made no sense But Szeth did not ask questions At the edge of the room he passed rows of unwavering azure lights that bulged out where wall met floor They held sapphires infused with Stormlight Profane How could the men of these lands use something so sacred for mere illumination Worse the Alethi scholars were said to be close to creating new Shardblades Szeth hoped that was just wishful boasting For if it did happen the world would be changed Likely in a way that ended with people in all countriesfrom distant Thaylenah to towering Jah Kevedspeaking Alethi to their children They were a grand people these Alethi Even drunk there was a natural nobility to them Tall and well made the men dressed in dark silk coats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately embroidered in silver or gold Each one looked a general on the field The women were even more splendid They wore grand silk dresses tightly fitted the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the men The left sleeve of each dress was longer than the right one covering the hand Alethi had an odd sense of propriety Their pure black hair was pinned up atop their heads either in intricate weavings of braids or in loose piles It was often woven with gold ribbons or ornaments along with gems that glowed with Stormlight Beautiful Profane but beautiful Szeth left the feasting chamber behind Just outside he passed the doorway into the Beggars Feast It was an Alethi tradition a room where some of the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast complementing that of the king and his guests A man with a long grey and black beard slumped in the doorway smiling foolishlythough whether from wine or a weak mind Szeth could not tell Have you seen me the man asked with slurred speech He laughed then began to speak in gibberish reaching for a wineskin So it was drink after all Szeth brushed by continuing past a line of statues depicting the Ten Heralds from ancient Vorin theology Jezerezeh Ishi Kelek Talenelat He counted off each one and realized there were only nine here One was conspicuously missing Why had Shalashs statue been removed King Gavilar was said to be very devout in his Vorin worship Too devout by some peoples standards The hallway here curved to the right running around the perimeter of the domed palace They were on the kings floor two levels up surrounded by rock walls ceiling and floor That was profane Stone was not to be trod upon But what was he to do He was Truthless He did as his masters demanded Today that included wearing white Loose white trousers tied at the waist with a rope and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves open at the front White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi Although Szeth had not asked his masters had explained why White to be bold White to not blend into the night White to give warning For if you were going to assassinate a man he was entitled to see you coming Szeth turned right taking the hallway directly toward the kings chambers Torches burned on the walls their light unsatisfying to him a meal of thin broth after a long fast Tiny flamespren danced around them like insects made solely of congealed light The torches were useless to him He reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained but then hesitated when he saw more of the blue lights ahead a pair of Stormlight lamps hanging on the wall brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts Szeth walked up to one of these holding out his hand to cup it around the glassshrouded gemstone You there a voice called in Alethi There were two guards at the intersection Double guard for there were savages abroad in Kholinar this night True those savages were supposed to be allies now But alliances could be shallow things indeed This one wouldnt last the hour Szeth looked as the two guards approached They carried spears they werent lighteyes and were therefore forbidden the sword Their painted red breastplates were ornate however as were their helms They might be darkeyed but they were highranking citizens with honored positions in the royal guard Stopping a few feet away the guard at the front gestured with his spear Go on now This is no place for you He had tan Alethi skin and a thin mustache that ran all the way around his mouth becoming a beard at the bottom Szeth didnt move Well the guard said What are you waiting for Szeth breathed in deeply drawing forth the Stormlight It streamed into him siphoned from the twin sapphire lamps on the walls sucked in as if by his deep inhalation The Stormlight raged inside of him and the hallway suddenly grew darker falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from the sun by a transient cloud Szeth could feel the Lights warmth its fury like a tempest that had been injected directly into his veins The power of it was invigorating but dangerous It pushed him to act To move To strike Holding his breath he clung to the Stormlight He could still feel it leaking out Stormlight could be held for only a short time a few minutes at most It leaked away the human body too porous a container He had heard that the Voidbringers could hold it in perfectly But then did they even exist His punishment declared that they didnt His honor demanded that they did Afire with holy energy Szeth turned to the guards They could see that he was leaking Stormlight wisps of it curling from his skin like luminescent smoke The lead guard squinted frowning Szeth was sure the man had never seen anything like it before As far as he knew Szeth had killed every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do Whatwhat are you The guards voice had lost its certainty Spirit or man What am I Szeth whispered a bit of Light leaking from his lips as he looked past the man down the long hallway Imsorry Szeth blinked Lashing himself to that distant point down the hallway Stormlight raged from him in a flash chilling his skin and the ground immediately stopped pulling him downward Instead he was pulled toward that distant pointit was as if to him that direction had suddenly become down This was a Basic Lashing first of his three kinds of Lashings It gave him the ability to manipulate whatever force spren or god it was that held men to the ground With this Lashing he could bind people or objects to different surfaces or in different directions From Szeths perspective the hallway was now a deep shaft down which he was falling and the two guards stood on one of the sides They were shocked when Szeths feet hit them one for each face throwing them over Szeth shifted his view and Lashed himself to the floor Light leaked from him The floor of the hallway again became down and he landed between the two guards clothes crackling and dropping flakes of frost He rose beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade One of the guards fumbled for his spear Szeth reached down touching the soldiers shoulder while looking up He focused on a point above him while willing the Light out of his body and into the guard Lashing the poor man to the ceiling The guard yelped in shock as up became down for him Light trailing from his form he crashed into the ceiling and dropped his spear It was not Lashed directly and clattered back down to the floor near Szeth To kill It was the greatest of sins And yet here Szeth stood Truthless profanely walking on stones used for building And it would not end As Truthless there was only one life he was forbidden to take And that was his own At the tenth beat of his heart his Shardblade dropped into his waiting hand It formed as if condensing from mist water beading along the metal length His Shardblade was long and thin edged on both sides smaller than most others Szeth swept it out carving a line in the stone floor and passing through the second guards neck As always the Shardblade killed oddly though it cut easily through stone steel or anything inanimate the metal fuzzed when it touched living skin It traveled through the guards neck without leaving a mark but once it did the mans eyes smoked and burned They blackened shriveling up in his head and he slumped forward dead A Shardblade did not cut living flesh it severed the soul itself Above the first guard gasped Hed managed to get to his feet even though they were planted on the ceiling of the hallway Shardbearer he shouted A Shardbearer assaults the kings hall To arms Finally Szeth thought Szeths use of Stormlight was unfamiliar to the guards but they knew a Shardblade when they saw one Szeth bent down and picked up the spear that had fallen from above As he did so he released the breath hed been holding since drawing in the Stormlight It sustained him while he held it but those two lanterns hadnt contained much of it so he would need to breathe again soon The Light began to leak away more quickly now that he wasnt holding his breath Szeth set the spears butt against the stone floor then looked upward The guard above stopped shouting eyes opening wide as the tails of his shirt began to slip downward the earth below reasserting its dominance The Light steaming off his body dwindled He looked down at Szeth Down at the spear tip pointing directly at his heart Violet fearspren crawled out of the stone ceiling around him The Light ran out The guard fell He screamed as he hit the spear impaling him through the chest Szeth let the spear fall away carried to the ground with a muffled thump by the body twitching on its end Shardblade in hand he turned down a side corridor following the map hed memorized He ducked around a corner and flattened himself against the wall just as a troop of guards reached the dead men The newcomers began shouting immediately continuing the alarm His instructions were clear Kill the king but be seen doing it Let the Alethi know he was coming and what he was doing Why Why did the Parshendi agree to this treaty only to send an assassin the very night of its signing More gemstones glowed on the walls of the hallway here King Gavilar liked lavish display and he couldnt know that he was leaving sources of power for Szeth to use in his Lashings The things Szeth did hadnt been seen for millennia Histories from those times were all but nonexistent and the legends were horribly inaccurate Szeth peeked back out into the corridor One of the guards at the intersection saw him pointing and yelling Szeth made sure they got a good look then ducked away He took a deep breath as he ran drawing in Stormlight from the lanterns His body came alive with it and his speed increased his muscles bursting with energy Light became a storm inside of him his blood thundered in his ears It was terrible and wonderful at the same time Two corridors down one to the side He threw open the door of a storage room then hesitated a momentjust long enough for a guard to round the corner and see himbefore dashing into the room Preparing for a Full Lashing he raised his arm and commanded the Stormlight to pool there causing the skin to burst alight with radiance Then he flung his hand out toward the doorframe spraying white luminescence across it like paint He slammed the door just as the guards arrived The Stormlight held the door in the frame with the strength of a hundred arms A Full Lashing bound objects together holding them fast until the Stormlight ran out It took longer to createand drained Stormlight far more quicklythan a Basic Lashing The door handle shook and then the wood began to crack as the guards threw their weight against it one man calling for an axe Szeth crossed the room in rapid strides weaving around the shrouded furniture that had been stored here It was of red cloth and deep expensive woods He reached the far wall andpreparing himself for yet another blasphemyhe raised his Shardblade and slashed horizontally through the dark grey stone The rock sliced easily a Shardblade could cut any inanimate object Two vertical slashes followed then one across the bottom cutting a large square block He pressed his hand against it willing Stormlight into the stone Behind him the rooms door began to crack He looked over his shoulder and focused on the shaking door Lashing the block in that direction Frost crystallized on his clothingLashing something so large required a great deal of Stormlight The tempest within him stilled like a storm reduced to a drizzle He stepped aside The large stone block shuddered sliding into the room Normally moving the block would have been impossible Its own weight would have held it against the stones below Yet now that same weight pulled it free for the block the direction of the rooms door was down With a deep grinding sound the block slid free of the wall and tumbled through the air smashing furniture The soldiers finally broke through the door staggering into the room just as the enormous block crashed into them Szeth turned his back on the terrible sound of the screams the splintering of wood the breaking of bones He ducked and stepped through his new hole entering the hallway outside He walked slowly drawing Stormlight from the lamps he passed siphoning it to him and stoking anew the tempest within As the lamps dimmed the corridor darkened A thick wooden door stood at the end and as he approached small fearsprenshaped like globs of purple goobegan to wriggle from the masonry pointing toward the doorway They were drawn by the terror being felt on the other side Szeth pushed the door open entering the last corridor leading to the kings chambers Tall red ceramic vases lined the pathway and they were interspersed with nervous soldiers They flanked a long narrow rug It was red like a river of blood The spearmen in front didnt wait for him to get close They broke into a trot lifting their short throwing spears Szeth slammed his hand to the side pushing Stormlight into the doorframe using the third and final type of Lashing a Reverse Lashing This one worked differently from the other two It did not make the doorframe emit Stormlight indeed it seemed to pull nearby light into it giving it a strange penumbra The spearmen threw and Szeth stood still hand on the doorframe A Reverse Lashing required his constant touch but took comparatively little Stormlight During one anything that approached himparticularly lighter objectswas instead pulled toward the Lashing itself The spears veered in the air splitting around him and slamming into the wooden frame As he felt them hit Szeth leaped into the air and Lashed himself to the right wall his feet hitting the stone with a slap He immediately reoriented his perspective To his eyes he wasnt standing on the wall the soldiers were the bloodred carpet streaming between them like a long tapestry Szeth bolted down the hallway striking with his Shardblade shearing through the necks of two men who had thrown spears at him Their eyes burned and they collapsed The other guards in the hallway began to panic Some tried to attack him others yelled for more help still others cringed away from him The attackers had troublethey were disoriented by the oddity of striking at someone who hung on the wall Szeth cut down a few then flipped into the air tucking into a roll and Lashed himself back to the floor He hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers Completely surrounded but holding a Shardblade According to legend the Shardblades were first carried by the Knights Radiant uncounted ages ago Gifts of their god granted to allow them to fight horrors of rock and flame dozens of feet tall foes whose eyes burned with hatred The Voidbringers When your foe had skin as hard as stone itself steel was useless Something supernal was required Szeth rose from his crouch loose white clothes rippling jaw clenched against his sins He struck out his weapon flashing with reflected torchlight Elegant wide swings Three of them one after another He could neither close his ears to the screams that followed nor avoid seeing the men fall They dropped round him like toys knocked over by a childs careless kick If the Blade touched a mans spine he died eyes burning If it cut through the core of a limb it killed that limb One soldier stumbled away from Szeth arm flopping uselessly on his shoulder He would never be able to feel it or use it again Szeth lowered his Shardblade standing among the cindereyed corpses Here in Alethkar men often spoke of the legendsof mankinds hardwon victory over the Voidbringers But when weapons created to fight nightmares were turned against common soldiers the lives of men became cheap things indeed Szeth turned and continued on his way slippered feet falling on the soft red rug The Shardblade as always glistened silver and clean When one killed with a Blade there was no blood That seemed like a sign The Shardblade was just a tool it could not be blamed for the murders The door at the end of the hallway burst open Szeth froze as a small group of soldiers rushed out ushering a man in regal robes his head ducked as if to avoid arrows The soldiers wore deep blue the color of the Kings Guard and the corpses didnt make them stop and gawk They were prepared for what a Shardbearer could do They opened a side door and shoved their ward through several leveling spears at Szeth as they backed out Another figure stepped from the kings quarters he wore glistening blue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates Unlike common plate armor however this armor had no leather or mail visible at the jointsjust smaller plates fitting together with intricate precision The armor was beautiful the blue inlaid with golden bands around the edges of each piece of plate the helm ornamented with three waves of small hornlike wings Shardplate the customary complement to a Shardblade The newcomer carried a sword as well an enormous Shardblade six feet long with a design along the blade like burning flames a weapon of silvery metal that gleamed and almost seemed to glow A weapon designed to slay dark gods a larger counterpart to the one Szeth carried Szeth hesitated He didnt recognize the armor he had not been warned that he would be set at this task and hadnt been given proper time to memorize the various suits of Plate or Blades owned by the Alethi But a Shardbearer would have to be dealt with before he chased the king he could not leave such a foe behind Besides perhaps a Shardbearer could defeat him kill him and end his miserable life His Lashings wouldnt work directly on someone in Shardplate and the armor would enhance the man strengthen him Szeths honor would not allow him to betray his mission or seek death But if that death occurred he would welcome it The Shardbearer struck and Szeth Lashed himself to the side of the hallway leaping with a twist and landing on the wall He danced backward Blade held at the ready The Shardbearer fell into an aggressive posture using one of the swordplay stances favored here in the East He moved far more nimbly than one would expect for a man in such bulky armor Shardplate was special as ancient and magical as the Blades it complemented The Shardbearer struck Szeth skipped to the side and Lashed himself to the ceiling as the Shardbearers Blade sliced into the wall Feeling a thrill at the contest Szeth dashed forward and attacked downward with an overhand blow trying to hit the Shardbearers helm The man ducked going down on one knee letting Szeths Blade cleave empty air Szeth leaped backward as the Shardbearer swung upward with his Blade slicing into the ceiling Szeth didnt own a set of Plate himself and didnt care to His Lashings interfered with the gemstones that powered Shardplate and he had to choose one or the other As the Shardbearer turned Szeth sprinted forward across the ceiling As expected the Shardbearer swung again and Szeth leaped to the side rolling He came up from his roll and flipped Lashing himself to the floor again He spun to land on the ground behind the Shardbearer He slammed his Blade into his opponents open back Unfortunately there was one major advantage Plate offered It could block a Shardblade Szeths weapon hit solidly causing a web of glowing lines to spread out across the back of the armor and Stormlight began to leak free from them Shardplate didnt dent or bend like common metal Szeth would have to hit the Shardbearer in the same location at least once more to break through Szeth danced out of range as the Shardbearer swung in anger trying to cut at Szeths knees The tempest within Szeth gave him many advantagesincluding the ability to quickly recover from small wounds But it would not restore limbs killed by a Shardblade He rounded the Shardbearer then picked a moment and dashed forward The Shardbearer swung again but Szeth briefly Lashed himself to the ceiling for lift He shot into the air cresting over the swing then immediately Lashed himself back to the floor He struck as he landed but the Shardbearer recovered quickly and executed a perfect followthrough stroke coming within a finger of hitting Szeth The man was dangerously skilled with that Blade Many Shardbearers depended too much on the power of their weapon and armor This man was different Szeth jumped to the wall and struck at the Shardbearer with quick terse attacks like a snapping eel The Shardbearer fended him off with wide sweeping counters His Blades length kept Szeth at bay This is taking too long Szeth thought If the king slipped away into hiding Szeth would fail in his mission no matter how many people he killed He ducked in for another strike but the Shardbearer forced him back Each second this fight lasted was another for the kings escape It was time to be reckless Szeth launched into the air Lashing himself to the other end of the hallway and falling feetfirst toward his adversary The Shardbearer didnt hesitate to swing but Szeth Lashed himself down at an angle dropping immediately The Shardblade swished through the air above him He landed in a crouch using his momentum to throw himself forward and swung at the Shardbearers side where the Plate had cracked He hit with a powerful blow That piece of the Plate shattered bits of molten metal streaking away The Shardbearer grunted dropping to one knee raising a hand to his side Szeth raised a foot to the mans side and shoved him backward with a Stormlightenhanced kick The heavy Shardbearer crashed into the door of the kings quarters smashing it and falling partway into the room beyond Szeth left him ducking instead through the doorway to the right following the way the king had gone The hallway here had the same red carpet and Stormlight lamps on the walls gave Szeth a chance to recharge the tempest within Energy blazed within him again and he sped up If he could get far enough ahead he could deal with the king then turn back to fight off the Shardbearer It wouldnt be easy A Full Lashing on a doorway wouldnt stop a Shardbearer and that Plate would let the man run supernaturally fast Szeth glanced over his shoulder The Shardbearer wasnt following The man sat up in his armor looking dazed Szeth could just barely see him sitting in the doorway surrounded by broken bits of wood Perhaps Szeth had wounded him more than hed thought Or maybe Szeth froze He thought of the ducked head of the man whod been rushed out face obscured The Shardbearer still wasnt following He was so skilled It was said that few men could rival Gavilar Kholins swordsmanship Could it be Szeth turned and dashed back trusting his instincts As soon as the Shardbearer saw him he climbed to his feet with alacrity Szeth ran faster What was the safest place for your king In the hands of some guards fleeing Or protected in a suit of Shardplate left behind dismissed as a bodyguard Clever Szeth thought as the formerly sluggish Shardbearer fell into another battle stance Szeth attacked with renewed vigor swinging his Blade in a flurry of strikes The Shardbearerthe kingaggressively struck out with broad sweeping blows Szeth pulled away from one of these feeling the wind of the weapon passing just inches before him He timed his next move then dashed forward ducking underneath the kings followthrough The king expecting another strike at his side twisted with his arm held protectively to block the hole in his Plate That gave Szeth the room to run past him and into the kings chambers The king spun around to follow but Szeth ran through the lavishly furnished chamber flinging out his hand touching pieces of furniture he passed He infused them with Stormlight Lashing them to a point behind the king The furniture tumbled as if the room had been turned on its side couches chairs and tables dropping toward the surprised king Gavilar made the mistake of chopping at them with his Shardblade The weapon easily sheared through a large couch but the pieces still crashed into him making him stumble A footstool hit him next throwing him to the ground Gavilar rolled out of the way of the furniture and charged forward Plate leaking streams of Light from the cracked sections Szeth gathered himself then leaped into the air Lashing himself backward and to the right as the king arrived He zipped out of the way of the kings blow then Lashed himself forward with two Basic Lashings in a row Stormlight flashed out of him clothing freezing as he was pulled toward the king at twice the speed of a normal fall The kings posture indicated surprise as Szeth lurched in midair then spun toward him swinging He slammed his Blade into the kings helm then immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling and fell upward slamming into the stone roof above Hed Lashed himself in too many directions too quickly and his body had lost track making it difficult to land gracefully He stumbled back to his feet Below the king stepped back trying to get into position to swing up at Szeth The mans helm was cracked leaking Stormlight and he stood protectively defending the side with the broken plate The king used a onehanded swing reaching for the ceiling Szeth immediately Lashed himself downward judging that the kings attack would leave him unable to get his sword back in time Szeth underestimated his opponent The king stepped into Szeths attack trusting his helm to absorb the blow Just as Szeth hit the helm a second timeshattering itGavilar punched with his off hand slamming his gauntleted fist into Szeths face Blinding light flashed in Szeths eyes a counterpoint to the sudden agony that crashed across his face Everything blurred his vision fading Pain So much pain He screamed Stormlight leaving him in a rush and he slammed back into something hard The balcony doors More pain broke out across his shoulders as if someone had stabbed him with a hundred daggers and he hit the ground and rolled to a stop muscles trembling The blow would have killed an ordinary man No time for pain No time for pain No time for pain He blinked shaking his head the world blurry and dark Was he blind No It was dark outside He was on the wooden balcony the force of the blow had thrown him through the doors Something was thumping Heavy footfalls The Shardbearer Szeth stumbled to his feet vision swimming Blood streamed from the side of his face and Stormlight rose from his skin blinding his left eye The Light It would heal him if it could His jaw felt unhinged Broken Hed dropped his Shardblade A lumbering shadow moved in front of him the Shardbearers armor had leaked enough Stormlight that the king was having trouble walking But he was coming Szeth screamed kneeling infusing Stormlight into the wooden balcony Lashing it downward The air frosted around him The tempest roared traveling down his arms into the wood He Lashed it downward then did it again He Lashed a fourth time as Gavilar stepped onto the balcony It lurched under the extra weight The wood cracked straining The Shardbearer hesitated Szeth Lashed the balcony downward a fifth time The balcony supports shattered and the entire structure broke free from the building Szeth screamed through a broken jaw and used his final bit of Stormlight to Lash himself to the side of the building He fell to the side passing the shocked Shardbearer then hit the wall and rolled The balcony dropped away the king looking up with shock as he lost his footing The fall was brief In the moonlight Szeth watched solemnlyvision still fuzzy blinded in one eyeas the structure crashed to the stone ground below The wall of the palace trembled and the crash of broken wood echoed from the nearby buildings Still standing on the side of the wall Szeth groaned climbing to his feet He felt weak hed used up his Stormlight too quickly straining his body He stumbled down the side of the building approaching the wreckage barely able to remain standing The king was still moving Shardplate would protect a man from such a fall but a large length of bloodied wood stuck up through Gavilars side piercing him where Szeth had broken the Plate earlier Szeth knelt down inspecting the mans painwracked face Strong features square chin black beard flecked with white striking pale green eyes Gavilar Kholin Iexpected youto come the king said between gasps Szeth reached underneath the front of the mans breastplate tapping the straps there They unfastened and he pulled the front of the breastplate free exposing the gemstones on its interior Two had been cracked and burned out Three still glowed Numb Szeth breathed in sharply absorbing the Light The storm began to rage again More Light rose from the side of his face repairing his damaged skin and bones The pain was still great Stormlight healing was far from instantaneous It would be hours before he recovered The king coughed You can tellThaidakarthat hes too late I dont know who that is Szeth said standing his words slurring from his broken jaw He held his hand to the side resummoning his Shardblade The king frowned Then who Restares Sadeas I never thought My masters are the Parshendi Szeth said Ten heartbeats passed and his Blade dropped into his hand wet with condensation The Parshendi That makes no sense Gavilar coughed hand quivering reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket He pulled out a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain You must take this They must not get it He seemed dazed Telltell my brotherhe must find the most important words a man can say Gavilar fell still Szeth hesitated then knelt down and took the sphere It was odd unlike any hed seen before Though it was completely dark it seemed to glow somehow With a light that was black The Parshendi Gavilar had said That makes no sense Nothing makes sense anymore Szeth whispered tucking the strange sphere away Its all unraveling I am sorry King of the Alethi I doubt that you care Not anymore at least He stood up At least you wont have to watch the world ending with the rest of us Beside the kings body his Shardblade materialized from mist clattering to the stones now that its master was dead It was worth a fortune kingdoms had fallen as men vied to possess a single Shardblade Shouts of alarm came from inside the palace Szeth needed to go But Tell my brother To Szeths people a dying request was sacred He took the kings hand dipping it in the mans own blood then used it to scrawl on the wood Brother You must find the most important words a man can say With that Szeth escaped into the night He left the kings Shardblade he had no use for it The Blade Szeth already carried was curse enough Youve killed me Bastards youve killed me While the sun is still hot I die Collected on the fifth day of the week Chach of the month Betab of the year 1171 ten seconds before death Subject was a darkeyed soldier thirtyone years of age Sample is considered questionable FIVE YEARS LATER Im going to die arent I Cenn asked The weathered veteran beside Cenn turned and inspected him The veteran wore a full beard cut short At the sides the black hairs were starting to give way to grey Im going to die Cenn thought clutching his spearthe shaft slick with sweat Im going to die Oh Stormfather Im going to die How old are you son the veteran asked Cenn didnt remember the mans name It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army form lines across the rocky battlefield That lining up seemed so civil Neat organized Shortspears in the front ranks longspears and javelins next archers at the sides The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenns leather jerkin and kneelength skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching breastplate Many of the lighteyes had full suits of armor They sat astride horses their honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed burgundy and deep forest green Were there Shardbearers among them Brightlord Amaram wasnt a Shardbearer Were any of his men What if Cenn had to fight one Ordinary men didnt kill Shardbearers It had happened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary Its really happening he thought with mounting terror This wasnt a drill in the camp This wasnt training out in the fields swinging sticks This was real Facing that facthis heart pounding like a frightened animal in his chest his legs unsteadyCenn suddenly realized that he was a coward He shouldnt have left the herds He should never have Son the veteran said voice firm How old are you Fifteen sir And whats your name Cenn sir The mountainous bearded man nodded Im Dallet Dallet Cenn repeated still staring out at the other army There were so many of them Thousands Im going to die arent I No Dallet had a gruff voice but somehow that was comforting Youre going to be just fine Keep your head on straight Stay with the squad But Ive barely had three months training He swore he could hear faint clangs from the enemys armor or shields I can barely hold this spear Stormfather Im dead I cant Son Dallet interrupted soft but firm He raised a hand and placed it on Cenns shoulder The rim of Dallets large round shield reflected the light from where it hung on his back You are going to be fine How can you know It came out as a plea Because lad Youre in Kaladin Stormblesseds squad The other soldiers nearby nodded in agreement Behind them waves and waves of soldiers were lining upthousands of them Cenn was right at the front with Kaladins squad of about thirty other men Why had Cenn been moved to a new squad at the last moment It had something to do with camp politics Why was this squad at the very front where casualties were bound to be the greatest Small fearsprenlike globs of purplish goobegan to climb up out of the ground and gather around his feet In a moment of sheer panic he nearly dropped his spear and scrambled away Dallets hand tightened on his shoulder Looking up into Dallets confident black eyes Cenn hesitated Did you piss before we formed ranks Dallet asked I didnt have time to Go now Here If you dont youll end up with it running down your leg in battle distracting you maybe killing you Do it Embarrassed Cenn handed Dallet his spear and relieved himself onto the stones When he finished he shot glances at those next to him None of Kaladins soldiers smirked They stood steady spears to their sides shields on their backs The enemy army was almost finished The field between the two forces was bare flat slickrock remarkably even and smooth broken only by occasional rockbuds It would have made a good pasture The warm wind blew in Cenns face thick with the watery scents of last nights highstorm Dallet a voice said A man walked up through the ranks carrying a shortspear that had two leather knife sheaths strapped to the haft The newcomer was a young manperhaps four years older than Cenns fifteenbut he was taller by several fingers than even Dallet He wore the common leathers of a spearman but under them was a pair of dark trousers That wasnt supposed to be allowed His black Alethi hair was shoulderlength and wavy his eyes a dark brown He also had knots of white cord on the shoulders of his jerkin marking him as a squadleader The thirty men around Cenn snapped to attention raising their spears in salute This is Kaladin Stormblessed Cenn thought incredulously This youth Dallet were soon going to have a new recruit Kaladin said He had a strong voice I need you to He trailed off as he noticed Cenn He found his way here just a few minutes ago sir Dallet said with a smile Ive been gettin him ready Well done Kaladin said I paid good money to get that boy away from Gare That mans so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side What Cenn thought Why would anyone pay to get me What do you think about the field Kaladin asked Several of the other spearmen nearby raised hands to shade from the sun scanning the rocks That dip next to the two boulders on the far right Dallet asked Kaladin shook his head Footings too rough Aye Perhaps it is What about the short hill over there Far enough to avoid the first fall close enough to not get too far ahead Kaladin nodded though Cenn couldnt see what they were looking at Looks good The rest of you louts hear that Dallet shouted The men raised their spears high Keep an eye on the new boy Dallet Kaladin said He wont know the signs Of course Dallet said smiling Smiling How could the man smile The enemy army was blowing horns Did that mean they were ready Even though Cenn had just relieved himself he felt a trickle of urine run down his leg Stay firm Kaladin said then trotted down the front line to talk to the next squadleader over Behind Cenn and the others the dozens of ranks were still growing The archers on the sides prepared to fire Dont worry son Dallet said Well be fine Squadleader Kaladin is lucky The soldier on the other side of Cenn nodded He was a lanky redhaired Veden with darker tan skin than the Alethi Why was he fighting in an Alethi army Thats right Kaladin hes stormblessed right sure he is We only lostwhat one man last battle But someone did die Cenn said Dallet shrugged People always die Our squad loses the fewest Youll see Kaladin finished conferring with the other squadleader then jogged back to his team Though he carried a shortspearmeant to be wielded onehanded with a shield in the other handhis was a hand longer than those held by the other men At the ready men Dallet called Unlike the other squadleaders Kaladin didnt fall into rank but stood out in front of his squad The men around Cenn shuffled excited The sounds were repeated through the vast army the stillness giving way before eagerness Hundreds of feet shuffling shields slapping clasps clanking Kaladin remained motionless staring down the other army Steady men he said without turning Behind a lighteyed officer passed on horseback Be ready to fight I want their blood men Fight and kill Steady Kaladin said again after the man passed Be ready to run Dallet said to Cenn Run But weve been trained to march in formation To stay in our line Sure Dallet said But most of the men dont have much more training than you Those who can fight well end up getting sent to the Shattered Plains to battle the Parshendi Kaladins trying to get us into shape to go there to fight for the king Dallet nodded down the line Most of these here will break and charge the lighteyes arent good enough commanders to keep them in formation So stay with us and run Should I have my shield out Around Kaladins team the other ranks were unhooking their shields But Kaladins squad left their shields on their backs Before Dallet could answer a horn blew from behind Go Dallet said Cenn didnt have much choice The entire army started moving in a clamor of marching boots As Dallet had predicted the steady march didnt last long Some men began yelling the roar taken up by others Lighteyes called for them to go run fight The line disintegrated As soon as that happened Kaladins squad broke into a dash running out into the front at full speed Cenn scrambled to keep up panicked and terrified The ground wasnt as smooth as it had seemed and he nearly tripped on a hidden rockbud vines withdrawn into its shell He righted himself and kept going holding his spear in one hand his shield clapping against his back The distant army was in motion as well their soldiers charging down the field There was no semblance of a battle formation or a careful line This wasnt anything like the training had claimed it would be Cenn didnt even know who the enemy was A landlord was encroaching on Brightlord Amarams territorythe land owned ultimately by Highprince Sadeas It was a border skirmish and Cenn thought it was with another Alethi princedom Why were they fighting each other Perhaps the king would have put a stop to it but he was on the Shattered Plains seeking vengeance for the murder of King Gavilar five years before The enemy had a lot of archers Cenns panic climbed to a peak as the first wave of arrows flew into the air He stumbled again itching to take out his shield But Dallet grabbed his arm and yanked him forward Hundreds of arrows split the sky dimming the sun They arced and fell dropping like skyeels upon their prey Amarams soldiers raised shields But not Kaladins squad No shields for them Cenn screamed And the arrows slammed into the middle ranks of Amarams army behind him Cenn glanced over his shoulder still running The arrows fell behind him Soldiers screamed arrows broke against shields only a few straggling arrows landed anywhere near the front ranks Why he yelled at Dallet How did you know They want the arrows to hit where the men are most crowded the large man replied Where theyll have the greatest chance of finding a body Several other groups in the van left their shields lowered but most ran awkwardly with their shields angled up to the sky worried about arrows that wouldnt hit them That slowed them and they risked getting trampled by the men behind who were getting hit Cenn itched to raise his shield anyway it felt so wrong to run without it The second volley hit and men screamed in pain Kaladins squad barreled toward the enemy soldiers some of whom were dying to arrows from Amarams archers Cenn could hear the enemy soldiers bellowing war cries could make out individual faces Suddenly Kaladins squad pulled to a halt forming a tight group Theyd reached the small incline that Kaladin and Dallet had chosen earlier Dallet grabbed Cenn and shoved him to the very center of the formation Kaladins men lowered spears pulling out shields as the enemy bore down on them The charging foe used no careful formation they didnt keep the ranks of longspears in back and shortspears in front They all just ran forward yelling in a frenzy Cenn scrambled to get his shield unlatched from his back Clashing spears rang in the air as squads engaged one another A group of enemy spearmen rushed up to Kaladins squad perhaps coveting the higher ground The three dozen attackers had some cohesion though they werent in as tight a formation as Kaladins squad was The enemy seemed determined to make up for it in passion they bellowed and screamed in fury rushing Kaladins line Kaladins team held rank defending Cenn as if he were some lighteyes and they were his honor guard The two forces met with a crash of metal on wood shields slamming together Cenn cringed back It was over in a few eyeblinks The enemy squad pulled back leaving two dead on the stone Kaladins team hadnt lost anyone They held their bristling V formation though one man stepped back and pulled out a bandage to wrap a thigh wound The rest of the men closed in to fill the spot The wounded man was hulking and thickarmed he cursed but the wound didnt look bad He was on his feet in a moment but didnt return to the place where hed been Instead he moved down to one end of the V formation a more protected spot The battlefield was chaos The two armies mingled indistinguishably sounds of clanging crunching and screaming churned in the air Many of the squads broke apart members rushing from one encounter to another They moved like hunters groups of three or four seeking lone individuals then brutally falling on them Kaladins team held its ground engaging only enemy squads that got too close Was this what a battle really was Cenns practice had trained him for long ranks of men shoulder to shoulder Not this frenzied intermixing this brutal pandemonium Why didnt more hold formation The real soldiers are all gone Cenn thought Off fighting in a real battle at the Shattered Plains No wonder Kaladin wants to get his squad there Spears flashed on all sides it was difficult to tell friend from foe despite the emblems on breastplates and colored paint on shields The battlefield broke down into hundreds of small groups like a thousand different wars happening at the same time After the first few exchanges Dallet took Cenn by the shoulder and placed him in the rank at the very bottom of the V pattern Cenn however was worthless When Kaladins team engaged enemy squads all of his training fled him It took everything he had to just remain there holding his spear outward and trying to look threatening For the better part of an hour Kaladins squad held their small hill working as a team shoulder to shoulder Kaladin often left his position at the front rushing this way and that banging his spear on his shield in a strange rhythm Those are signals Cenn realized as Kaladins squad moved from the V shape into a ring With the screams of the dying and the thousands of men calling to others it was nearly impossible to hear a single persons voice But the sharp clang of the spear against the metal plate on Kaladins shield was clear Each time they changed formations Dallet grabbed Cenn by the shoulder and steered him Kaladins team didnt chase down stragglers They remained on the defensive And while several of the men in Kaladins team took wounds none of them fell Their squad was too intimidating for the smaller groups and larger enemy units retreated after a few exchanges seeking easier foes Eventually something changed Kaladin turned watching the tides of the battle with discerning brown eyes He raised his spear and smacked his shield in a quick rhythm he hadnt used before Dallet grabbed Cenn by the arm and pulled him away from the small hill Why abandon it now Just then the larger body of Amarams force broke the men scattering Cenn hadnt realized how poorly the battle in this quarter had been going for his side As Kaladins team retreated they passed many wounded and dying and Cenn grew nauseated Soldiers were sliced open their insides spilling out He didnt have time for horror the retreat quickly turned into a rout Dallet cursed and Kaladin beat his shield again The squad changed direction heading eastward There Cenn saw a larger group of Amarams soldiers was holding But the enemy had seen the ranks break and that made them bold They rushed forward in clusters like wild axehounds hunting stray hogs Before Kaladins team was halfway across the field of dead and dying a large group of enemy soldiers intercepted them Kaladin reluctantly banged his shield his squad slowed Cenn felt his heart begin to thump faster and faster Nearby a squad of Amarams soldiers was consumed men stumbled and fell screaming trying to get away The enemies used their spears like skewers killing men on the ground like cremlings Kaladins men met the enemy in a crash of spears and shields Bodies shoved on all sides and Cenn was spun about In the jumble of friend and foe dying and killing Cenn grew overwhelmed So many men running in so many directions He panicked scrambling for safety A group of soldiers nearby wore Alethi uniforms Kaladins squad Cenn ran for them but when some turned toward him Cenn was terrified to realize he didnt recognize them This wasnt Kaladins squad but a small group of unfamiliar soldiers holding an uneven broken line Wounded and terrified they scattered as soon as an enemy squad got close Cenn froze holding his spear in a sweaty hand The enemy soldiers charged right for him His instincts urged him to flee yet he had seen so many men picked off one at a time He had to stand He had to face them He couldnt run he couldnt He yelled stabbing his spear at the lead soldier The man casually knocked the weapon aside with his shield then drove his shortspear into Cenns thigh The pain was hot so hot that the blood squirting out on his leg felt cold by comparison Cenn gasped The soldier yanked the weapon free Cenn stumbled backward dropping his spear and shield He fell to rocky ground splashing in someone elses blood His foe raised a spear high a looming silhouette against the stark blue sky ready to ram it into Cenns heart And then he was there Squadleader Stormblessed Kaladins spear came as if out of nowhere narrowly deflecting the blow that was to have killed Cenn Kaladin set himself in front of Cenn alone facing down six spearmen He didnt flinch He charged It happened so quickly Kaladin swept the feet from beneath the man who had stabbed Cenn Even as that man fell Kaladin reached up and flipped a knife from one of the sheaths tied about his spear His hand snapped knife flashing and hitting the thigh of a second foe That man fell to one knee screaming A third man froze looking at his fallen allies Kaladin shoved past a wounded enemy and slammed his spear into the gut of the third man A fourth man fell with a knife to the eye When had Kaladin grabbed that knife He spun between the last two his spear a blur wielding it like a quarterstaff For a moment Cenn thought he could see something surrounding the squadleader A warping of the air like the wind itself become visible Ive lost a lot of blood Its flowing out so quickly Kaladin spun knocking aside attacks and the last two spearmen fell with gurgles that Cenn thought sounded surprised Foes all down Kaladin turned and knelt beside Cenn The squadleader set aside his spear and whipped a white strip of cloth from his pocket then efficiently wrapped it tight around Cenns leg Kaladin worked with the ease of one who had bound wounds dozens of times before Kaladin sir Cenn said pointing at one of the soldiers Kaladin had wounded The enemy man held his leg as he stumbled to his feet In a second however mountainous Dallet was there shoving the foe with his shield Dallet didnt kill the wounded man but let him stumble away unarmed The rest of the squad arrived and formed a ring around Kaladin Dallet and Cenn Kaladin stood up raising his spear to his shoulder Dallet handed him back his knives retrieved from the fallen foes Had me worried there sir Dallet said Running off like that I knew youd follow Kaladin said Raise the red banner Cyn Korater youre going back with the boy Dallet hold here Amarams line is bulging in this direction We should be safe soon And you sir Dallet asked Kaladin looked across the field A pocket had opened in the enemy forces and a man rode there on a white horse swinging about him with a wicked mace He wore full plate armor polished and gleaming silver A Shardbearer Cenn said Dallet snorted No thank the Stormfather Just a lighteyed officer Shardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute Kaladin watched the lighteyes with a seething hatred It was the same hatred Cenns father had shown when hed spoken of chull rustlers or the hatred Cenns mother would display when someone mentioned Kusiri who had run off with the cobblers son Sir Dallet said hesitantly Subsquads Two and Three pincer pattern Kaladin said his voice hard Were taking a brightlord off his throne You sure thats wise sir Weve got wounded Kaladin turned toward Dallet Thats one of Hallaws officers He might be the one You dont know that sir Regardless hes a battalionlord If we kill an officer that high were all but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains Were taking him His eyes grew distant Imagine it Dallet Real soldiers A warcamp with discipline and lighteyes with integrity A place where our fighting will mean something Dallet sighed but nodded Kaladin waved to a group of his soldiers then they raced across the field A smaller group of soldiers including Dallet waited behind with the wounded One of thosea thin man with black Alethi hair speckled with a handful of blond hairs marking some foreign bloodpulled a long red ribbon from his pocket and attached it to his spear He held the spear aloft letting the ribbon flap in the wind Its a call for runners to carry our wounded off the field Dallet said to Cenn Well have you out of here soon You were brave standing against those six Fleeing seemed stupid Cenn said trying to take his mind off his throbbing leg With so many wounded on the field how can we think that the runnersll come for us Squadleader Kaladin bribes them Dallet said They usually only carry off lighteyes but there are more runners than there are wounded lighteyes The squadleader puts most of his pay into the bribes This squad is different Cenn said feeling lightheaded Told you Not because of luck Because of training Thats part of it Part of it is because we know if we get hurt Kaladin will get us off the battlefield He paused looking over his shoulder As Kaladin had predicted Amarams line was surging back recovering The mounted enemy lighteyes from before was energetically laying about with his mace A group of his honor guard moved to one side engaging Kaladins subsquads The lighteyes turned his horse He wore an openfronted helm that had sloping sides and a large set of plumes on the top Cenn couldnt make out his eye color but he knew it would be blue or green maybe yellow or light grey He was a brightlord chosen at birth by the Heralds marked for rule He impassively regarded those who fought nearby Then one of Kaladins knives took him in the right eye The brightlord screamed falling back off the saddle as Kaladin somehow slipped through the lines and leaped upon him spear raised Aye its part training Dallet said shaking his head But its mostly him He fights like a storm that one and thinks twice as fast as other men The way he moves sometimes He bound my leg Cenn said realizing he was beginning to speak nonsense due to the blood loss Why point out the bound leg It was a simple thing Dallet just nodded He knows a lot about wounds He can read glyphs too Hes a strange man for a lowly darkeyed spearman our squadleader is He turned to Cenn But you should save your strength son The squadleader wont be pleased if we lose you not after what he paid to get you Why Cenn asked The battlefield was growing quieter as if many of the dying men had already yelled themselves hoarse Almost everyone around them was an ally but Dallet still watched to make sure no enemy soldiers tried to strike at Kaladins wounded Why Dallet Cenn repeated feeling urgent Why bring me into his squad Why me Dallet shook his head Its just how he is Hates the thought of young kids like you barely trained going to battle Every now and again he grabs one and brings him into his squad A good half dozen of our men were once like you Dallets eyes got a faroff look I think you all remind him of someone Cenn glanced at his leg Painsprenlike small orange hands with overly long fingerswere crawling around him reacting to his agony They began turning away scurrying in other directions seeking other wounded His pain was fading his leghis whole bodyfeeling numb He leaned back staring up at the sky He could hear faint thunder That was odd The sky was cloudless Dallet cursed Cenn turned shocked out of his stupor Galloping directly toward them was a massive black horse bearing a rider in gleaming armor that seemed to radiate light That armor was seamlessno chain underneath just smaller plates incredibly intricate The figure wore an unornamented full helm and the plate was gilded He carried a massive sword in one hand fully as long as a man was tall It wasnt a simple straight swordit was curved and the side that wasnt sharp was ridged like flowing waves Etchings covered its length It was beautiful Like a work of art Cenn had never seen a Shardbearer but he knew immediately what this was How could he ever have mistaken a simple armored lighteyes for one of these majestic creatures Hadnt Dallet claimed there would be no Shardbearers on this battlefield Dallet scrambled to his feet calling for the subsquad to form up Cenn just sat where he was He couldnt have stood not with that leg wound He felt so lightheaded How much blood had he lost He could barely think Either way he couldnt fight You didnt fight something like this Sun gleamed against that plate armor And that gorgeous intricate sinuous sword It was likelike the Almighty himself had taken form to walk the battlefield And why would you want to fight the Almighty Cenn closed his eyes Ten orders We were loved once Why have you forsaken us Almighty Shard of my soul where have you gone Collected on the second day of Kakash year 1171 five seconds before death Subject was a lighteyed woman in her third decade EIGHT MONTHS LATER Kaladins stomach growled as he reached through the bars and accepted the bowl of slop He pulled the small bowlmore a cupbetween the bars sniffed it then grimaced as the caged wagon began to roll again The sludgy grey slop was made from overcooked tallew grain and this batch was flecked with crusted bits of yesterdays meal Revolting though it was it was all he would get He began to eat legs hanging out between the bars watching the scenery pass The other slaves in his cage clutched their bowls protectively afraid that someone might steal from them One of them tried to steal Kaladins food on the first day Hed nearly broken the mans arm Now everyone left him alone Suited him just fine He ate with his fingers careless of the dirt Hed stopped noticing dirt months ago He hated that he felt some of that same paranoia that the others showed How could he not after eight months of beatings deprivation and brutality He fought down the paranoia He wouldnt become like them Even if hed given up everything elseeven if all had been taken from him even if there was no longer hope of escape This one thing he would retain He was a slave But he didnt need to think like one He finished the slop quickly Nearby one of the other slaves began to cough weakly There were ten slaves in the wagon all men scragglybearded and dirty It was one of three wagons in their caravan through the Unclaimed Hills The sun blazed reddish white on the horizon like the hottest part of a smiths fire It lit the framing clouds with a spray of color paint thrown carelessly on a canvas Covered in tall monotonously green grass the hills seemed endless On a nearby mound a small figure flitted around the plants dancing like a fluttering insect The figure was amorphous vaguely translucent Windspren were devious spirits who had a penchant for staying where they werent wanted Hed hoped that this one had gotten bored and left but as Kaladin tried to toss his wooden bowl aside he found that it stuck to his fingers The windspren laughed zipping by nothing more than a ribbon of light without form He cursed tugging on the bowl Windspren often played pranks like that He pried at the bowl and it eventually came free Grumbling he tossed it to one of the other slaves The man quickly began to lick at the remnants of the slop Hey a voice whispered Kaladin looked to the side A slave with dark skin and matted hair was crawling up to him timid as if expecting Kaladin to be angry Youre not like the others The slaves black eyes glanced upward toward Kaladins forehead which bore three brands The first two made a glyphpair given to him eight months ago on his last day in Amarams army The third was fresh given to him by his most recent master Shash the last glyph read Dangerous The slave had his hand hidden behind his rags A knife No that was ridiculous None of these slaves could have hidden a weapon the leaves hidden in Kaladins belt were as close as one could get But old instincts could not be banished easily so Kaladin watched that hand I heard the guards talking the slave continued shuffling a little closer He had a twitch that made him blink too frequently Youve tried to escape before they said You have escaped before Kaladin made no reply Look the slave said moving his hand out from behind his rags and revealing his bowl of slop It was half full Take me with you next time he whispered Ill give you this Half my food from now until we get away Please As he spoke he attracted a few hungerspren They looked like brown flies that flitted around the mans head almost too small to see Kaladin turned away looking out at the endless hills and their shifting moving grasses He rested one arm across the bars and placed his head against it legs still hanging out Well the slave asked Youre an idiot If you gave me half your food youd be too weak to escape if I were to flee Which I wont It doesnt work But Ten times Kaladin whispered Ten escape attempts in eight months fleeing from five different masters And how many of them worked WellI meanyoure still here Eight months Eight months as a slave eight months of slop and beatings It might as well have been an eternity He barely remembered the army anymore You cant hide as a slave Kaladin said Not with that brand on your forehead Oh I got away a few times But they always found me And then back I went Once men had called him lucky Stormblessed Those had been liesif anything Kaladin had bad luck Soldiers were a superstitious sort and though hed initially resisted that way of thinking it was growing harder and harder Every person he had ever tried to protect had ended up dead Time and time again And now here he was in an even worse situation than where hed begun It was better not to resist This was his lot and he was resigned to it There was a certain power in that a freedom The freedom of not having to care The slave eventually realized Kaladin wasnt going to say anything further and so he retreated eating his slop The wagons continued to roll fields of green extending in all directions The area around the rattling wagons was bare however When they approached the grass pulled away each individual stalk withdrawing into a pinprick hole in the stone After the wagons moved on the grass timidly poked back out and stretched its blades toward the air And so the cages moved along what appeared to be an open rock highway cleared just for them This far into the Unclaimed Hills the highstorms were incredibly powerful The plants had learned to survive Thats what you had to do learn to survive Brace yourself weather the storm Kaladin caught a whiff of another sweaty unwashed body and heard the sound of shuffling feet He looked suspiciously to the side expecting that same slave to be back It was a different man this time though He had a long black beard stuck with bits of food and snarled with dirt Kaladin kept his own beard shorter allowing Tvlakvs mercenaries to hack it down periodically Like Kaladin the slave wore the remains of a brown sack tied with a rag and he was darkeyed of courseperhaps a deep dark green though with darkeyes it was hard to tell They all looked brown or black unless you caught them in the right light The newcomer cringed away raising his hands He had a rash on one hand the skin just faintly discolored Hed likely approached because hed seen Kaladin respond to that other man The slaves had been frightened of him since the first day but they were also obviously curious Kaladin sighed and turned away The slave hesitantly sat down Mind if I ask how you became a slave friend Cant help wondering Were all wondering Judging by the accent and the dark hair the man was Alethi like Kaladin Most of the slaves were Kaladin didnt reply to the question Me I stole a herd of chull the man said He had a raspy voice like sheets of paper rubbing together If Id taken one chull they might have just beaten me But a whole herd Seventeen head He chuckled to himself admiring his own audacity In the far corner of the wagon someone coughed again They were a sorry lot even for slaves Weak sickly underfed Some like Kaladin were repeat runawaysthough Kaladin was the only one with a shash brand They were the most worthless of a worthless caste purchased at a steep discount They were probably being taken for resale in a remote place where men were desperate for labor There were plenty of small independent cities along the coast of the Unclaimed Hills places where Vorin rules governing the use of slaves were just a distant rumor Coming this way was dangerous These lands were ruled by nobody and by cutting across open land and staying away from established trade routes Tvlakv could easily run afoul of unemployed mercenaries Men who had no honor and no fear of slaughtering a slavemaster and his slaves in order to steal a few chulls and wagons Men who had no honor Were there men who had honor No Kaladin thought Honor died eight months ago So asked the scragglybearded man What did you do to get made a slave Kaladin raised his arm against the bars again How did you get caught Odd thing that the man said Kaladin hadnt answered his question but he had replied That seemed enough It was a woman of course Should have known shed sell me Shouldnt have stolen chulls Too slow Horses would have been better The man laughed riotously Horses What do you think me a madman If Id been caught stealing those Id have been hanged Chulls at least only earned me a slaves brand Kaladin glanced to the side This mans forehead brand was older than Kaladins the skin around the scar faded to white What was that glyphpair Sas morom Kaladin said It was the highlords district where the man had originally been branded The man looked up with shock Hey You know glyphs Several of the slaves nearby stirred at this oddity You must have an even better story than I thought friend Kaladin stared out over those grasses blowing in the mild breeze Whenever the wind picked up the more sensitive of the grass stalks shrank down into their burrows leaving the landscape patchy like the coat of a sickly horse That windspren was still there moving between patches of grass How long had it been following him At least a couple of months now That was downright odd Maybe it wasnt the same one They were impossible to tell apart Well the man prodded Why are you here There are many reasons why Im here Kaladin said Failures Crimes Betrayals Probably the same for most every one of us Around him several of the men grunted in agreement one of those grunts then degenerated into a hacking cough Persistent coughing a part of Kaladins mind thought accompanied by an excess of phlegm and fevered mumbling at night Sounds like the grindings Well the talkative man said perhaps I should ask a different question Be more specific thats what my mother always said Say what you mean and ask for what you want Whats the story of you getting that first brand of yours Kaladin sat feeling the wagon thump and roll beneath him I killed a lighteyes His unnamed companion whistled again this time even more appreciative than before Im surprised they let you live Killing the lighteyes isnt why I was made a slave Kaladin said Its the one I didnt kill thats the problem Hows that Kaladin shook his head then stopped answering the talkative mans questions The man eventually wandered to the front of the wagons cage and sat down staring at his bare feet Hours later Kaladin still sat in his place idly fingering the glyphs on his forehead This was his life day in and day out riding in these cursed wagons His first brands had healed long ago but the skin around the shash brand was red irritated and crusted with scabs It throbbed almost like a second heart It hurt even worse than the burn had when he grabbed the heated handle of a cooking pot as a child Lessons drilled into Kaladin by his father whispered in the back of his brain giving the proper way to care for a burn Apply a salve to prevent infection wash once daily Those memories werent a comfort they were an annoyance He didnt have fourleaf sap or listers oil he didnt even have water for the washing The parts of the wound that had scabbed over pulled at his skin making his forehead feel tight He could barely pass a few minutes without scrunching up his brow and irritating the wound Hed grown accustomed to reaching up and wiping away the streaks of blood that trickled from the cracks his right forearm was smeared with it If hed had a mirror he could probably have spotted tiny red rotspren gathering around the wound The sun set in the west but the wagons kept rolling Violet Salas peeked over the horizon to the east seeming hesitant at first as if making sure the sun had vanished It was a clear night and the stars shivered high above Talns Scara swath of deep red stars that stood out vibrantly from the twinkling white oneswas high in the sky this season That slave whod been coughing earlier was at it again A ragged wet cough Once Kaladin would have been quick to go help but something within him had changed So many people hed tried to help were now dead It seemed to himirrationallythat the man would be better off without his interference After failing Tien then Dallet and his team then ten successive groups of slaves it was hard to find the will to try again Two hours past First Moon Tvlakv finally called a halt His two brutish mercenaries climbed from their places atop their wagons then moved to build a small fire Lanky Taranthe serving boytended the chulls The large crustaceans were nearly as big as wagons themselves They settled down pulling into their shells for the night with clawfuls of grain Soon they were nothing more than three lumps in the darkness barely distinguishable from boulders Finally Tvlakv began checking on the slaves one at a time giving each a ladle of water making certain his investments were healthy Or at least as healthy as could be expected for this poor lot Tvlakv started with the first wagon and Kaladinstill sittingpushed his fingers into his makeshift belt checking on the leaves hed hidden there They crackled satisfactorily the stiff dried husks rough against his skin He still wasnt certain what he was going to do with them Hed grabbed them on a whim during one of the sessions when hed been allowed out of the wagon to stretch his legs He doubted anyone else in the caravan knew how to recognize blackbanenarrow leaves on a trefoil prongso it hadnt been too much of a risk Absently he took the leaves out and rubbed them between forefinger and palm They had to dry before reaching their potency Why did he carry them Did he mean to give them to Tvlakv and get revenge Or were they a contingency to be retained in case things got too bad too unbearable Surely I havent fallen that far he thought It was just more likely his instinct of securing a weapon when he saw one no matter how unusual The landscape was dark Salas was the smallest and dimmest of the moons and while her violet coloring had inspired countless poets she didnt do much to help you see your hand in front of your face Oh a soft feminine voice said Whats that A translucent figurejust a handspan tallpeeked up from over the edge of the floor near Kaladin She climbed up and into the wagon as if scaling some high plateau The windspren had taken the shape of a young womanlarger spren could change shapes and sizeswith an angular face and long flowing hair that faded into mist behind her head SheKaladin couldnt help but think of the windspren as a shewas formed of pale blues and whites and wore a simple flowing white dress of a girlish cut that came down to midcalf Like the hair it faded to mist at the very bottom Her feet hands and face were crisply distinct and she had the hips and bust of a slender woman Kaladin frowned at the spirit Spren were all around you just ignored them most of the time But this one was an oddity The windspren walked upward as if climbing an invisible staircase She reached a height where she could stare at Kaladins hand so he closed his fingers around the black leaves She walked around his fist in a circle Although she glowed like an afterimage from looking at the sun her form provided no real illumination She bent down looking at his hand from different angles like a child expecting to find a hidden piece of candy What is it Her voice was like a whisper You can show me I wont tell anyone Is it a treasure Have you cut off a piece of the nights cloak and tucked it away Is it the heart of a beetle so tiny yet powerful He said nothing causing the spren to pout She floated up hovering though she had no wings and looked him in the eyes Kaladin why must you ignore me Kaladin started What did you say She smiled mischievously then sprang away her figure blurring into a long white ribbon of bluewhite light She shot between the barstwisting and warping in the air like a strip of cloth caught in the windand darted beneath the wagon Storm you Kaladin said leaping to his feet Spirit What did you say Repeat that Spren didnt use peoples names Spren werent intelligent The larger oneslike windspren or riversprencould mimic voices and expressions but they didnt actually think They didnt Did any of you hear that Kaladin asked turning to the cages other occupants The roof was just high enough to let Kaladin stand The others were lying back waiting to get their ladle of water He got no response beyond a few mutters to be quiet and some coughs from the sick man in the corner Even Kaladins friend from earlier ignored him The man had fallen into a stupor staring at his feet wiggling his toes periodically Maybe they hadnt seen the spren Many of the larger ones were invisible except to the person they were tormenting Kaladin sat back down to floor of the wagon hanging his legs outside The windspren had said his name but undoubtedly shed just repeated what shed heard before Butnone of the men in the cage knew his name Maybe Im going mad Kaladin thought Seeing things that arent there Hearing voices He took a deep breath then opened his hand His grip had cracked and broken the leaves Hed need to tuck them away to prevent further Those leaves look interesting said that same feminine voice You like them a lot dont you Kaladin jumped twisting to the side The windspren stood in the air just beside his head white dress rippling in a wind Kaladin couldnt feel How do you know my name he demanded The windspren didnt answer She walked on air over to the bars then poked her head out watching Tvlakv the slaver administer drinks to the last few slaves in the first wagon She looked back at Kaladin Why dont you fight You did before Now youve stopped Why do you care spirit She cocked her head I dont know she said as if surprised at herself But I do Isnt that odd It was more than odd What did he make of a spren that not only used his name but seemed to remember things he had done weeks ago People dont eat leaves you know Kaladin she said folding translucent arms Then she cocked her head Or do you I cant remember Youre so strange stuffing some things into your mouths leaking out other things when you dont think anyone is looking How do you know my name he whispered How do you know it I know it becausebecause its mine My parents told it to me I dont know Well I dont either she said nodding as if shed just won some grand argument Fine he said But why are you using my name Because its polite And you are impolite Spren dont know what that means See there she said pointing at him Impolite Kaladin blinked Well he was far from where hed grown up walking foreign stone and eating foreign food Perhaps the spren who lived here were different from those back home So why dont you fight she asked flitting down to rest on his legs looking up at his face She had no weight that he could feel I cant fight he said softly You did before He closed his eyes and rested his head forward against the bars Im so tired He didnt mean the physical fatigue though eight months eating leftovers had stolen much of the lean strength hed cultivated while at war He felt tired Even when he got enough sleep Even on those rare days when he wasnt hungry cold or stiff from a beating So tired You have been tired before Ive failed spirit he replied squeezing his eyes shut Must you torment me so They were all dead Cenn and Dallet and before that Tukks and the Takers Before that Tien Before that blood on his hands and the corpse of a young girl with pale skin Some of the slaves nearby muttered likely thinking he was mad Anyone could end up drawing a spren but you learned early that talking to one was pointless Was he mad Perhaps he should wish for thatmadness was an escape from the pain Instead it terrified him He opened his eyes Tvlakv was finally waddling up to Kaladins wagon with his bucket of water The portly browneyed man walked with a very faint limp the result of a broken leg perhaps He was Thaylen and all Thaylen men had the same stark white beardsregardless of their age or the color of the hair on their headsand white eyebrows Those eyebrows grew very long and the Thaylen wore them pushed back over the ears That made him appear to have two white streaks in his otherwise black hair His clothingstriped trousers of black and red with a dark blue sweater that matched the color of his knit caphad once been fine but it was now growing ragged Had he once been something other than a slaver This lifethe casual buying and selling of human fleshseemed to have an effect on men It wearied the soul even if it did fill ones money pouch Tvlakv kept his distance from Kaladin carrying his oil lantern over to inspect the coughing slave at the front of the cage Tvlakv called to his mercenaries BluthKaladin didnt know why hed bothered to learn their nameswandered over Tvlakv spoke quietly pointing at the slave Bluth nodded slablike face shadowed in the lanternlight and pulled the cudgel free from his belt The windspren took the form of a white ribbon then zipped over toward the sick man She spun and twisted a few times before landing on the floor becoming a girl again She leaned in to inspect the man Like a curious child Kaladin turned away and closed his eyes but he could still hear the coughing Inside his mind his fathers voice responded To cure the grinding coughs said the careful precise tone administer two handfuls of bloodivy crushed to a powder each day If you dont have that be certain to give the patient plenty of liquids preferably with sugar stirred in As long as the patient stays hydrated he will most likely survive The disease sounds far worse than it is Most likely survive Those coughs continued Someone unlatched the cage door Would they know how to help the man Such an easy solution Give him water and he would live It didnt matter Best not to get involved Men dying on the battlefield A youthful face so familiar and dear looking to Kaladin for salvation A sword wound slicing open the side of a neck A Shardbearer charging through Amarams ranks Blood Death Failure Pain And his fathers voice Can you really leave him son Let him die when you could have helped Storm it Stop Kaladin yelled standing The other slaves scrambled back Bluth jumped up slamming the cage door closed and holding up his cudgel Tvlakv shied behind the mercenary using him as cover Kaladin took a deep breath closing his hand around the leaves and then raising the other to his head wiping away a smear of blood He crossed the small cage bare feet thumping on the wood Bluth glared as Kaladin knelt beside the sick man The flickering light illuminated a long drawn face and nearly bloodless lips The man had coughed up phlegm it was greenish and solid Kaladin felt the mans neck for swelling then checked his dark brown eyes Its called the grinding coughs Kaladin said He will live if you give him an extra ladle of water every two hours for five days or so Youll have to force it down his throat Mix in sugar if you have any Bluth scratched at his ample chin then glanced at the shorter slaver Pull him out Tvlakv said The wounded slave awoke as Bluth unlocked the cage The mercenary waved Kaladin back with his cudgel and Kaladin reluctantly withdrew After putting away his cudgel Bluth grabbed the slave under the arms and dragged him out all the while trying to keep a nervous eye on Kaladin Kaladins last failed escape attempt had involved twenty armed slaves His master should have executed him for that but he had claimed Kaladin was intriguing and branded him with shash then sold him for a pittance There always seemed to be a reason Kaladin survived when those hed tried to help died Some men might have seen that as a blessing but he saw it as an ironic kind of torment Hed spent some time under his previous master speaking with a slave from the West a Selay man who had spoken of the Old Magic from their legends and its ability to curse people Could that be what was happening to Kaladin Dont be foolish he told himself The cage door snapped back in place locking The cages were necessaryTvlakv had to protect his fragile investment from the highstorms The cages had wooden sides that could be pulled up and locked into place during the furious gales Bluth dragged the slave over to the fire beside the unpacked water barrel Kaladin felt himself relax There he told himself Perhaps you can still help Perhaps theres a reason to care Kaladin opened his hand and looked down at the crumbled black leaves in his palm He didnt need these Sneaking them into Tvlakvs drink would not only be difficult but pointless Did he really want the slaver dead What would that accomplish A low crack rang in the air followed by a second one duller like someone dropping a bag of grain Kaladin snapped his head up looking to where Bluth had deposited the sick slave The mercenary raised his cudgel one more time then snapped it down the weapon making a cracking sound as it hit the slaves skull The slave hadnt uttered a cry of pain or protest His corpse slumped over in the darkness Bluth casually picked it up and slung it over his shoulder No Kaladin yelled leaping across the cage and slamming his hands against the bars Tvlakv stood warming himself by the fire Storm you Kaladin screamed He could have lived you bastard Tvlakv glanced at him Then leisurely the slaver walked over straightening his deep blue knit cap He would have gotten you all sick you see His voice was lightly accented smashing words together not giving the proper syllables emphasis Thaylens always sounded to Kaladin like they were mumbling I would not lose an entire wagon for one man Hes past the spreading stage Kaladin said slamming his hands against the bars again If any of us were going to catch it wed have done so by now Hope that you dont I think he was past saving I told you otherwise And I should believe you deserter Tvlakv said amused A man with eyes that smolder and hate You would kill me He shrugged I care not So long as you are strong when it is time for sales You should bless me for saving you from that mans sickness Ill bless your cairn when I pile it up myself Kaladin replied Tvlakv smiled walking back toward the fire Keep that fury deserter and that strength It will pay me well on our arrival Not if you dont live that long Kaladin thought Tvlakv always warmed the last of the water from the bucket he used for the slaves Hed make himself tea from it hanging it over the fire If Kaladin made sure he was watered last then powdered the leaves and dropped them into the Kaladin froze then looked down at his hands In his haste hed forgotten that hed been holding the blackbane Hed dropped the flakes as he slammed his hands against the bars Only a few bits stuck to his palms not enough to be potent He spun to look backward the floor of the cage was dirty and covered with grime If the flakes had fallen there there was no way to collect them The wind gathered suddenly blowing dust crumbs and dirt out of the wagon and into the night Even in this Kaladin failed He sank down his back to the bars and bowed his head Defeated That cursed windspren kept darting around him looking confused A man stood on a cliffside and watched his homeland fall into dust The waters surged beneath so far beneath And he heard a child crying They were his own tears Collected on the 4th of Tanates year 1171 thirty seconds before death Subject was a cobbler of some renown Kharbranth City of Bells was not a place that Shallan had ever imagined she would visit Though shed often dreamed of traveling shed expected to spend her early life sequestered in her familys manor only escaping through the books of her fathers library Shed expected to marry one of her fathers allies then spend the rest of her life sequestered in his manor But expectations were like fine pottery The harder you held them the more likely they were to crack She found herself breathless clutching her leatherbound drawing pad to her chest as longshoremen pulled the ship into the dock Kharbranth was enormous Built up the side of a steep incline the city was wedgeshaped as if it were built into a wide crack with the open side toward the ocean The buildings were blocky with square windows and appeared to have been constructed of some kind of mud or daub Crem perhaps They were painted bright colors reds and oranges most often but occasional blues and yellows too She could hear the bells already tinkling in the wind ringing with pure voices She had to strain her neck to look up toward the citys loftiest rim Kharbranth was like a mountain towering over her How many people lived in a place like this Thousands Tens of thousands She shivered againdaunted yet excitedthen blinked pointedly fixing the image of the city in her memory Sailors rushed about The Winds pleasure was a narrow singlemasted vessel barely large enough for her the captain his wife and the halfdozen crew It had seemed so small at first but Captain Tozbek was a calm and cautious man an excellent sailor even if he was a pagan Hed guided the ship with care along the coast always finding a sheltered cove to ride out highstorms The captain oversaw the work as the men secured the mooring Tozbek was a short man evenshouldered with Shallan and he wore his long white Thaylen eyebrows up in a curious spiked pattern It was like he had two waving fans above his eyes a foot long each He wore a simple knit cap and a silverbuttoned black coat Shed imagined him getting that scar on his jaw in a furious sea battle with pirates The day before shed been disappointed to hear it had been caused by loose tackle during rough weather His wife Ashlv was already walking down the gangplank to register their vessel The captain saw Shallan inspecting him and so walked over He was a business connection of her familys long trusted by her father That was good since the plan she and her brothers had concocted had contained no place for her bringing along a ladyinwaiting or nurse That plan made Shallan nervous Very very nervous She hated being duplicitous But the financial state of her houseThey either needed a spectacular infusion of wealth or some other edge in local Veden house politics Otherwise they wouldnt last the year First things first Shallan thought forcing herself to be calm Find Jasnah Kholin Assuming she hasnt moved off without you again Ive sent a lad on your behalf Brightness Tozbek said If the princess is still here we shall soon know Shallan nodded gratefully still clutching her drawing pad Out in the city there were people everywhere Some wore familiar clothingtrousers and shirts that laced up the front for the men skirts and colorful blouses for the women Those could have been from her homeland Jah Keved But Kharbranth was a free city A small politically fragile citystate it held little territory but had docks open to all ships that passed and it asked no questions about nationality or status People flowed to it That meant many of the people she saw were exotic Those singlesheet wraps would mark a man or woman from Tashikk far to the west The long coats enveloping down to the ankles but open in the front like cloakswhere were those from Shed rarely seen so many parshmen as she noted working the docks carrying cargo on their backs Like the parshmen her father had owned these were stout and thick of limb with their odd marbled skinsome parts pale or black others a deep crimson The mottled pattern was unique to each individual After chasing Jasnah Kholin from town to town for the better part of six months Shallan was beginning to think shed never catch the woman Was the princess avoiding her No that didnt seem likelyShallan just wasnt important enough to wait for Brightness Jasnah Kholin was one of the most powerful women in the world And one of the most infamous She was the only member of a faithful royal house who was a professed heretic Shallan tried not to grow anxious Most likely theyd discover that Jasnah had moved on again The Winds pleasure would dock for the night and Shallan would negotiate a price with the captainsteeply discounted because of her familys investments in Tozbeks shipping businessto take her to the next port Already they were months past the time when Tozbek had expected to be rid of her Shed never sensed resentment from him his honor and loyalty kept him agreeing to her requests However his patience wouldnt last forever and neither would her money Shed already used over half the spheres shed brought with her He wouldnt abandon her in an unfamiliar city of course but he might regretfully insist on taking her back to Vedenar Captain a sailor said rushing up the gangplank He wore only a vest and loose baggy trousers and had the darkly tanned skin of one who worked in the sun No message sir Dock registrar says that Jasnah hasnt left yet Ha the captain said turning to Shallan The hunt is over Bless the Heralds Shallan said softly The captain smiled flamboyant eyebrows looking like streaks of light coming from his eyes It must be your beautiful face that brought us this favorable wind The windspren themselves were entranced by you Brightness Shallan and led us here Shallan blushed considering a response that wasnt particularly proper Ah the captain said pointing at her I can see you have a replyI see it in your eyes young miss Spit it out Words arent meant to be kept inside you see They are free creatures and if locked away will unsettle the stomach Its not polite Shallan protested Tozbek bellowed a laugh Months of travel and still you claim that I keep telling you that were sailors We forgot how to be polite the moment we set first foot on a ship were far beyond redemption now She smiled Shed been trained by stern nurses and tutors to hold her tongueunfortunately her brothers had been even more determined in encouraging her to do the opposite Shed made a habit of entertaining them with witty comments when nobody else was near She thought fondly of hours spent by the crackling greatroom hearth the younger three of her four brothers huddled around her listening as she made sport of their fathers newest sycophant or a traveling ardent Shed often fabricated silly versions of conversations to fill the mouths of people they could see but not hear That had established in her what her nurses had referred to as an insolent streak And the sailors were even more appreciative of a witty comment than her brothers had been Well Shallan said to the captain blushing but still eager to speak I was just thinking this You say that my beauty coaxed the winds to deliver us to Kharbranth with haste But wouldnt that imply that on other trips my lack of beauty was to blame for us arriving late Weller So in reality Shallan said youre telling me Im beautiful precisely onesixth of the time Nonsense Young miss youre like a morning sunrise you are Like a sunrise By that you mean entirely too crimsonshe pulled at her long red hairand prone to making men grouchy when they see me He laughed and several of the sailors nearby joined in All right then Captain Tozbek said youre like a flower She grimaced Im allergic to flowers He raised an eyebrow No really she admitted I think theyre quite captivating But if you were to give me a bouquet youd soon find me in a fit so energetic that it would have you searching the walls for stray freckles I might have blown free with the force of my sneezes Well be that true I still say youre as pretty as a flower If I am then young men my age must be afflicted with the same allergyfor they keep their distance from me noticeably She winced Now see I told you this wasnt polite Young women should not act in such an irritable way Ah young miss the captain said tipping his knit cap toward her The lads and I will miss your clever tongue Im not sure what well do without you Sail likely she said And eat and sing and watch the waves All the things you do now only you shall have rather more time to accomplish all of it as you wont be stumbling across a youthful girl as she sits on your deck sketching and mumbling to herself But you have my thanks Captain for a trip that was wonderfulif somewhat exaggerated in length He tipped his cap to her in acknowledgment Shallan grinnedshe hadnt expected being out on her own to be so liberating Her brothers had worried that shed be frightened They saw her as timid because she didnt like to argue and remained quiet when large groups were talking And perhaps she was timidbeing away from Jah Keved was daunting But it was also wonderful Shed filled three sketchbooks with pictures of the creatures and people shed seen and while her worry over her houses finances was a perpetual cloud it was balanced by the sheer delight of experience Tozbek began making dock arrangements for his ship He was a good man As for his praise of her supposed beauty she took that for what it was A kind if overstated mark of affection She was paleskinned in an era when Alethi tan was seen as the mark of true beauty and though she had light blue eyes her impure family line was manifest in her auburnred hair Not a single lock of proper black Her freckles had faded as she reached young womanhoodHeralds be blessedbut there were still some visible dusting her cheeks and nose Young miss the captain said to her after conferring with his men Your Brightness Jasnah shell undoubtedly be at the Conclave you see Oh where the Palanaeum is Yes yes And the king lives there too Its the center of the city so to speak Except its on the top He scratched his chin Well anyway Brightness Jasnah Kholin is sister to a king she will stay nowhere else not in Kharbranth Yalb here will show you the way We can deliver your trunk later Many thanks Captain she said Shaylor mkabat nour The winds have brought us safely A phrase of thanks in the Thaylen language The captain smiled broadly Mkai bade fortenthis She had no idea what that meant Her Thaylen was quite good when she was reading but hearing it spoken was something else entirely She smiled at him which seemed the proper response for he laughed gesturing to one of his sailors Well wait here in this dock for two days he told her There is a highstorm coming tomorrow you see so we can not leave If the situation with the Brightness Jasnah does not proceed as hoped well take you back to Jah Keved Thank you again Tis nothing young miss he said Nothing but what wed be doing anyway We can take on goods here and all Besides thats a right nice likeness of my wife you gave me for my cabin Right nice He strode over to Yalb giving him instructions Shallan waited putting her drawing pad back into her leather portfolio Yalb The name was difficult for her Veden tongue to pronounce Why were the Thaylens so fond of mashing letters together without proper vowels Yalb waved for her She moved to follow Be careful with yourself lass the captain warned as she passed Even a safe city like Kharbranth hides dangers Keep your wits about you I should think Id prefer my wits inside my skull Captain she replied carefully stepping onto the gangplank If I keep them about me instead then someone has gotten entirely too close to my head with a cudgel The captain laughed waving her farewell as she made her way down the gangplank holding the railing with her freehand Like all Vorin women she kept her left handher safehandcovered exposing only her freehand Common darkeyed women would wear a glove but a woman of her rank was expected to show more modesty than that In her case she kept her safehand covered by the oversized cuff of her left sleeve which was buttoned closed The dress was of a traditional Vorin cut formfitting through the bust shoulders and waist with a flowing skirt below It was blue silk with chullshell buttons up the sides and she carried her satchel by pressing it to her chest with her safehand while holding the railing with her freehand She stepped off the gangplank into the furious activity of the docks messengers running this way and that women in red coats tracking cargos on ledgers Kharbranth was a Vorin kingdom like Alethkar and like Shallans own Jah Keved They werent pagans here and writing was a feminine art men learned only glyphs leaving letters and reading to their wives and sisters She hadnt asked but she was certain Captain Tozbek could read Shed seen him holding books it had made her uncomfortable Reading was an unseemly trait in a man At least men who werent ardents You wan na ride Yalb asked her his rural Thaylen dialect so thick she could barely make out the words Yes please He nodded and rushed off leaving her on the docks surrounded by a group of parshmen who were laboriously moving wooden crates from one pier to another Parshmen were thickwitted but they made excellent workers Never complaining always doing as they were told Her father had preferred them to regular slaves Were the Alethi really fighting parshmen out on the Shattered Plains That seemed so odd to Shallan Parshmen didnt fight They were docile and practically mute Of course from what shed heard the ones out on the Shattered Plainsthe Parshendi they were calledwere physically different from regular parshmen Stronger taller keener of mind Perhaps they werent really parshmen at all but distant relatives of some kind To her surprise she could see signs of animal life all around the docks A few skyeels undulated through the air searching for rats or fish Tiny crabs hid between cracks in the docks boards and a cluster of haspers clung to the docks thick logs In a street inland of the docks a prowling mink skulked in the shadows watching for morsels that might be dropped She couldnt resist pulling open her portfolio and beginning a sketch of a pouncing skyeel Wasnt it afraid of all the people She held her sketchpad with her safehand hidden fingers wrapping around the top as she used a charcoal pencil to draw Before she was finished her guide returned with a man pulling a curious contraption with two large wheels and a canopycovered seat She hesitantly lowered her sketchpad Shed expected a palanquin The man pulling the machine was short and darkskinned with a wide smile and full lips He gestured for Shallan to sit and she did so with the modest grace her nurses had drilled into her The driver asked her a question in a clipped tersesounding language she didnt recognize What was that she asked Yalb He wants to know if youd like to be pulled the long way or the short way Yalb scratched his head Im not right sure what the difference is I suspect one takes longer Shallan said Oh you are a clever one Yalb said something to the porter in that same clipped language and the man responded The long way gives a good view of the city Yalb said The short way goes straight up to the Conclave Not many good views he says I guess he noticed you were new to the city Do I stand out that much Shallan asked flushing Eh no of course not Brightness And by that you mean that Im as obvious as a wart on a queens nose Yalb laughed Afraid so But you cant go someplace a second time until you been there a first time I reckon Everyone has to stand out sometime so you might as well do it in a pretty way like yourself Shed had to get used to gentle flirtation from the sailors They were never too forward and she suspected the captains wife had spoken to them sternly when shed noticed how it made Shallan blush Back at her fathers manor servantseven those who had been full citizenshad been afraid to step out of their places The porter was still waiting for an answer The short way please she told Yalb though she longed to take the scenic path She was finally in a real city and she took the direct route But Brightness Jasnah had proven to be as elusive as a wild songling Best to be quick The main roadway cut up the hillside in switchbacks and so even the short way gave her time to see much of the city It proved intoxicatingly rich with strange people sights and ringing bells Shallan sat back and took it all in Buildings were grouped by color and that color seemed to indicate purpose Shops selling the same items would be painted the same shadesviolet for clothing green for foods Homes had their own pattern though Shallan couldnt interpret it The colors were soft with a washedout subdued tonality Yalb walked alongside her cart and the porter began to talk back toward her Yalb translated hands in the pockets of his vest He says that the city is special because of the lait here Shallan nodded Many cities were built in laitsareas protected from the highstorms by nearby rock formations Kharbranth is one of the most sheltered major cities in the world Yalb continued translating and the bells are a symbol of that Its said they were first erected to warn that a highstorm was blowing since the winds were so soft that people didnt always notice Yalb hesitated Hes just saying things because he wants a big tip Brightness Ive heard that story but I think its blustering ridiculous If the winds blew strong enough to move bells then peopled notice Besides people didnt notice it was raining on their blustering heads Shallan smiled Its all right He can continue The porter chatted on in his clipped voicewhat language was that anyway Shallan listened to Yalbs translation drinking in the sights sounds andunfortunatelyscents Shed grown up accustomed to the crisp smell of freshly dusted furniture and flatbread baking in the kitchens Her ocean journey had taught her new scents of brine and clean sea air There was nothing clean in what she smelled here Each passing alleyway had its own unique array of revolting stenches These alternated with the spicy scents of street vendors and their foods and the juxtaposition was even more nauseating Fortunately her porter moved into the central part of the roadway and the stenches abated though it did slow them as they had to contend with thicker traffic She gawked at those they passed Those men with gloved hands and faintly bluish skin were from Natanatan But who were those tall stately people dressed in robes of black And the men with their beards bound in cords making them rodlike The sounds put Shallan in mind of the competing choruses of wild songlings near her home only multiplied in variety and volume A hundred voices called to one another mingling with doors slamming wheels rolling on stone occasional skyeels crying The everpresent bells tinkled in the background louder when the wind blew They were displayed in the windows of shops hung from rafters Each lantern pole along the street had a bell hung under the lamp and her cart had a small silvery one at the very tip of its canopy When she was about halfway up the hillside a rolling wave of loud clock bells rang the hour The varied unsynchronized chimes made a clangorous din The crowds thinned as they reached the upper quarter of the city and eventually her porter pulled her to a massive building at the very apex of the city Painted white it was carved from the rock face itself rather than built of bricks or clay The pillars out front grew seamlessly from the stone and the back side of the building melded smoothly into the cliff The outcroppings of roof had squat domes atop them and were painted in metallic colors Lighteyed women passed in and out carrying scribing utensils and wearing dresses like Shallans their left hands properly cuff ed The men entering or leaving the building wore militarystyle Vorin coats and stiff trousers buttons up the sides and ending in a stiff collar that wrapped the entire neck Many carried swords at their waists the belts wrapping around the kneelength coats The porter stopped and made a comment to Yalb The sailor began arguing with him hands on hips Shallan smiled at his stern expression and she blinked pointedly affixing the scene in her memory for later sketching Hes offering to split the difference with me if I let him inflate the price of the trip Yalb said shaking his head and offering a hand to help Shallan from the cart She stepped down looking at the porter who shrugged smiling like a child who had been caught sneaking sweets She clutched her satchel with her cuff ed arm searching through it with her freehand for her money pouch How much should I actually give him Two clearchips should be more than enough Id have offered one The thief wanted to ask for five Before this trip shed never used money shed just admired the spheres for their beauty Each one was composed of a glass bead a little larger than a persons thumbnail with a much smaller gemstone set at the center The gemstones could absorb Stormlight and that made the spheres glow When she opened the money pouch shards of ruby emerald diamond and sapphire shone out on her face She fished out three diamond chips the smallest denomination Emeralds were the most valuable for they could be used by Soulcasters to create food The glass part of most spheres was the same size the size of the gemstone at the center determined the denomination The three chips for instance each had only a tiny splinter of diamond inside Even that was enough to glow with Stormlight far fainter than a lamp but still visible A markthe medium denomination of spherewas a little less bright than a candle and it took five chips to make a mark Shed brought only infused spheres as shed heard that dun ones were considered suspect and sometimes a moneylender would have to be brought in to judge the authenticity of the gemstone She kept the most valuable spheres she had in her safepouch of course which was buttoned to the inside of her left sleeve She handed the three chips to Yalb who cocked his head She nodded at the porter blushing realizing that shed reflexively used Yalb like a masterservant intermediary Would he be offended He laughed and stood up stiffly as if imitating a masterservant paying the porter with a mock stern expression The porter laughed bowed to Shallan then pulled his cart away This is for you Shallan said taking out a ruby mark and handing it to Yalb Brightness this is too much Its partially out of thanks she said but is also to pay you to stay here and wait for a few hours in case I return Wait a few hours for a firemark Thats wages for a weeks sailing Then it should be enough to make certain you dont wander off Ill be right here Yalb said giving her an elaborate bow that was surprisingly wellexecuted Shallan took a deep breath and strode up the steps toward the Conclaves imposing entrance The carved rock really was remarkablethe artist in her wanted to linger and study it but she didnt dare Entering the large building was like being swallowed The hallway inside was lined with Stormlight lamps that shone with white light Diamond broams were probably set inside them most buildings of fine construction used Stormlight to provide illumination A broamthe highest denomination of sphereglowed with about the same light as several candles Their light shone evenly and softly on the many attendants scribes and lighteyes moving through the hallway The building appeared to be constructed as one broad high and long tunnel burrowed into the rock Grand chambers lined the sides and subsidiary corridors branched off the central grand promenade She felt far more comfortable than she had outdoors This placewith its bustling servants its lesser brightlords and brightladieswas familiar She raised her freehand in a sign of need and sure enough a masterservant in a crisp white shirt and black trousers hurried over to her Brightness he asked speaking her native Veden likely because of the color of her hair I seek Jasnah Kholin Shallan said I have word that she is within these walls The masterservant bowed crisply Most masterservants prided themselves on their refined servicethe very same air that Yalb had been mocking moments ago I shall return Brightness He would be of the second nahn a darkeyed citizen of very high rank In Vorin belief ones Callingthe task to which one dedicated ones lifewas of vital importance Choosing a good profession and working hard at it was the best way to ensure good placement in the afterlife The specific devotary that one visited for worship often had to do with the nature of ones chosen Calling Shallan folded her arms waiting She had thought long about her own Calling The obvious choice was her art and she did so love sketching But it was more than just the drawing that attracted herit was the study the questions raised by observation Why werent the skyeels afraid of people What did haspers feed on Why did a rat population thrive in one area but fail in another So shed chosen natural history instead She longed to be a true scholar to receive real instruction to spend time on deep research and study Was that part of why shed suggested this daring plan of seeking out Jasnah and becoming her ward Perhaps However she needed to remain focused Becoming Jasnahs wardand therefore studentwas only one step She considered this as she idly walked up to a pillar using her freehand to feel the polished stone Like much of Rosharsave for certain coastal regionsKharbranth was built on raw unbroken stone The buildings outside had been set directly on the rock and this one sliced into it The pillar was granite she guessed though her geological knowledge was sketchy The floor was covered with long burntorange rugs The material was dense designed to look rich but bear heavy traffic The broad rectangular hallway had an old feel to it One book shed read claimed that Kharbranth had been founded way back into the shadowdays years before the Last Desolation That would make it old indeed Thousands of years old created before the terrors of the Hierocracy long beforeeventhe Recreance Back when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the land Brightness a voice asked Shallan turned to find that the servant had returned This way Brightness She nodded to the servant and he led her quickly down the busy hallway She went over how to present herself to Jasnah The woman was a legend Even Shallanliving in the remote estates of Jah Kevedhad heard of the Alethi kings brilliant heretic sister Jasnah was only thirtyfour years old yet many felt she would already have obtained the cap of a master scholar if it werent for her vocal denunciations of religion Most specifically she denounced the devotaries the various religious congregations that proper Vorin people joined Improper quips would not serve Shallan well here She would have to be proper Wardship to a woman of great renown was the best way to be schooled in the feminine arts music painting writing logic and science It was much like how a young man would train in the honor guard of a brightlord he respected Shallan had originally written to Jasnah requesting a wardship in desperation she hadnt actually expected the woman to reply in the affirmative When she hadvia a letter commanding Shallan to attend her in Dumadari in two weeksShallan had been shocked Shed been chasing the woman ever since Jasnah was a heretic Would she demand that Shallan renounce her faith She doubted she could do such a thing Vorin teachings regarding ones Glory and Calling had been one of her few refuges during the difficult days when her father had been at his worst They turned into a narrower hallway entering corridors increasingly far from the main cavern Finally the masterservant stopped at a corner and gestured for Shallan to continue There were voices coming from the corridor to the right Shallan hesitated Sometimes she wondered how it had come to this She was the quiet one the timid one the youngest of five siblings and the only girl Sheltered protected all her life And now the hopes of her entire house rested on her shoulders Their father was dead And it was vital that remain a secret She didnt like to think of that dayshe all but blocked it from her mind and trained herself to think of other things But the effects of his loss could not be ignored He had made many promisessome business deals some bribes some of the latter disguised as the former House Davar owed great amounts of money to a great number of people and without her father to keep them all appeased the creditors would soon begin making demands There was nobody to turn to Her family mostly because of her father was loathed even by its allies Highprince Valamthe brightlord to whom her family gave fealtywas ailing and no longer offered them the protection he once had When it became known that her father was dead and her family bankrupt that would be the end of House Davar Theyd be consumed and subjugated to another house Theyd be worked to the bone as punishmentin fact they might even face assassination by disgruntled creditors Preventing that depended on Shallan and the first step came with Jasnah Kholin Shallan took a deep breath then strode around the corner Im dying arent I Healer why do you take my blood Who is that beside you with his head of lines I can see a distant sun dark and cold shining in a black sky Collected on the 3rd of Jesnan 1172 11 seconds predeath Subject was a Reshi chull trainer Sample is of particular note Why dont you cry the windspren asked Kaladin sat with his back to the corner of the cage looking down The floor planks in front of him were splintered as if someone had dug at them with nothing but his fingernails The splintered section was stained dark where the dry grey wood had soaked up blood A futile delusional attempt at escape The wagon continued to roll The same routine each day Wake up sore and aching from a fitful night spent without mattress or blanket One wagon at a time the slaves were let out and hobbled with leg irons and given time to shuffle around and relieve themselves Then they were packed away and given morning slop and the wagons rolled until afternoon slop More rolling Evening slop then a ladle of water before sleep Kaladins shash brand was still cracked and bleeding At least the cages top gave shade from the sun The windspren shifted to mist floating like a tiny cloud She moved in close to Kaladin the motion outlining her face at the front of the cloud as if blowing back the fog and revealing something more substantial underneath Vaporous feminine and angular With such curious eyes Like no other spren hed seen The others cry at night she said But you dont Why cry he said leaning his head back against the bars What would it change I dont know Why do men cry He smiled closing his eyes Ask the Almighty why men cry little spren Not me His forehead dripped with sweat from the Eastern summer humidity and it stung as it seeped into his wound Hopefully theyd have some weeks of spring again soon Weather and seasons were unpredictable You never knew how long they would go on though typically each would last a few weeks The wagon rolled on After a time he felt sunlight on his face He opened his eyes The sun shone in through the upper side of the cage Two or three hours past noon then What of afternoon slop Kaladin stood pulling himself up with one hand on the steel bars He couldnt make out Tvlakv driving the wagon up ahead only flatfaced Bluth behind The mercenary had on a dirty shirt that laced up the front and wore a widebrimmed hat against the sun his spear and cudgel riding on the wagon bench beside him He didnt carry a swordnot even Tvlakv did that not near Alethi land The grass continued to part for the wagons vanishing just in front then creeping out after the wagons passed The landscape here was dotted with strange shrubs that Kaladin didnt recognize They had thick stalks and stems and spiny green needles Whenever the wagons grew too close the needles pulled into the stalks leaving behind twisted wormlike trunks with knotted branches They dotted the hilly landscape rising from the grasscovered rocks like diminutive sentries The wagons just kept on going well past noon Why arent we stopping for slop The lead wagon finally pulled to a stop The other two lurched to a halt behind it the redcarapaced chulls fidgeted their antennae waving back and forth The boxshaped animals had bulging stony shells and thick trunklike red legs From what Kaladin had heard their claws could snap a mans arm But chulls were docile particularly domesticated ones and hed never known anyone in the army to get more than a halfhearted pinch from one Bluth and Tag climbed down from their wagons and walked up to meet Tvlakv The slavemaster stood on his wagons seat shading his eyes against the white sunlight and holding a sheet of paper in his hand An argument ensued Tvlakv kept waving in the direction they had been going then pointing at his sheet of paper Lost Tvlakv Kaladin called Perhaps you should pray to the Almighty for guidance I hear he has a fondness for slavers Keeps a special room in Damnation just for you To Kaladins left one of the slavesthe longbearded man who had talked to him a few days backsidled away not wanting to stand close to a person who was provoking the slaver Tvlakv hesitated then waved curtly to his mercenaries silencing them The portly man hopped down from his wagon and walked over to Kaladin You he said Deserter Alethi armies travel these lands for their war Do you know anything of the area Let me see the map Kaladin said Tvlakv hesitated then held it up for Kaladin Kaladin reached through the bars and snatched the paper Then without reading it Kaladin ripped it in two In seconds hed shredded it into a hundred pieces in front of Tvlakvs horrified eyes Tvlakv called for the mercenaries but by the time they arrived Kaladin had a double handful of confetti to toss out at them Happy Middlefest you bastards Kaladin said as the flakes of paper fluttered around them He turned and walked to the other side of the cage and sat down facing them Tvlakv stood speechless Then red faced he pointed at Kaladin and hissed something at the mercenaries Bluth took a step toward the cage but then thought better of it He glanced at Tvlakv then shrugged and walked away Tvlakv turned to Tag but the other mercenary just shook his head saying something soft After a few minutes of stewing at the cowardly mercenaries Tvlakv rounded the cage and approached where Kaladin was sitting Surprisingly when he spoke his voice was calm I see you are clever deserter You have made yourself invaluable My other slaves they arent from this area and I have never come this way You can bargain What is it you wish in exchange for leading us I can promise you an extra meal each day should you please me You want me to lead the caravan Instructions will be acceptable All right First find a cliff That it will give you a vantage to see the area No Kaladin said It will give me something to throw you off of Tvlakv adjusted his cap in annoyance brushing back one of his long white eyebrows You hate me That is good Hatred will keep you strong make you sell for much But you will not find vengeance on me unless I have a chance to take you to market I will not let you escape But perhaps someone else would You want to be sold you see I dont want vengeance Kaladin said The windspren came backshed darted off for a time to inspect one of the strange shrubs She landed in the air and began walking around Tvlakvs face inspecting him He didnt seem to be able to see her Tvlakv frowned No vengeance It doesnt work Kaladin said I learned that lesson long ago Long ago You can not be older than eighteen years deserter It was a good guess He was nineteen Had it really only been four years since hed joined Amarams army Kaladin felt as if hed aged a dozen You are young Tvlakv continued You could escape this fate of yours Men have been known to live beyond the slaves brandyou could pay off your slave price you see Or convince one of your masters to give you your freedom You could become a free man again It is not so unlikely Kaladin snorted Ill never be free of these brands Tvlakv You must know that Ive triedand failedto escape ten times over Its more than these glyphs on my head that makes your mercenaries wary Past failure does not prove that there is not chance in the future yes Im finished I dont care He eyed the slaver Besides you dont actually believe what youre saying I doubt a man like you would be able to sleep at night if he thought the slaves he sold would be free to seek him out one day Tvlakv laughed Perhaps deserter Perhaps you are right Or perhaps I simply think that if you were to get free you would hunt down the first man who sold you to slavery you see Highlord Amaram was it not His death would give me warning so I can run How had he known How had he heard about Amaram Ill find him Kaladin thought Ill gut him with my own hands Ill twist his head right off his neck Ill Yes Tvlakv said studying Kaladins face so you were not so honest when you said you do not thirst for vengeance I see How do you know about Amaram Kaladin said scowling Ive changed hands a halfdozen times since then Men talk Slavers more than most We must be friends with one another you see for nobody else will stomach us Then you know that I didnt get this brand for deserting Ah but it is what we must pretend you see Men guilty of high crimes they do not sell so well With that shash glyph on your head it will be difficult enough to get a good price for you If I can not sell you then youwell you will not wish for that status So we will play a game together I will say you are a deserter And you will say nothing It is an easy game I think Its illegal We are not in Alethkar Tvlakv said so there is no law Besides desertion was the official reason for your sale Claim otherwise and you will gain nothing but a reputation for dishonesty Nothing besides a headache for you But you just said you have no desire for vengeance against me I could learn Tvlakv laughed Ah if you have not learned that already then you probably never will Besides did you not threaten to throw me off a cliff I think you have learned already But now we must discuss how to proceed My map has met with an untimely demise you see Kaladin hesitated then sighed I dont know he said honestly Ive never been this way either Tvlakv frowned He leaned closer to the cage inspecting Kaladin though he still kept his distance After a moment Tvlakv shook his head I believe you deserter A pity Well I shall trust my memory The map was poorly rendered anyway I am almost glad you ripped it for I was tempted to do the same myself If I should happen across any portraits of my former wives I shall see that they cross your path and take advantage of your unique talents He strolled away Kaladin watched him go then cursed to himself What was that for the windspren said walking up to him head cocked I almost find myself liking him Kaladin said pounding his head back against the cage Butafter what he did Kaladin shrugged I didnt say Tvlakv isnt a bastard Hes just a likable bastard He hesitated then grimaced Those are the worst kind When you kill them you end up feeling guilty for it The wagon leaked during highstorms That wasnt surprising Kaladin suspected that Tvlakv had been driven to slaving by ill fortune He would rather be trading other goods but somethinglack of funds a need to leave his previous environs with hastehad forced him to pick up this least reputable of careers Men like him couldnt afford luxury or even quality They could barely stay ahead of their debts In this case that meant wagons which leaked The boarded sides were strong enough to withstand highstorm winds but they werent comfortable Tvlakv had almost missed getting ready for this highstorm Apparently the map Kaladin had torn up had also included a list of highstorm dates purchased from a roving stormwarden The storms could be predicted mathematically Kaladins father had made a hobby of it Hed been able to pick the right day eight times out of ten The boards rattled against the cages bars as wind buffeted the vehicle shaking it making it lurch it like a clumsy giants plaything The wood groaned and spurts of icy rainwater sprayed through cracks Flashes of lightning leaked through as well accompanied by thunder That was the only light they got Occasionally light would flash without the thunder The slaves would groan in terror at this thinking about the Stormfather the shades of the Lost Radiants or the Voidbringersall of which were said to haunt the most violent highstorms They huddled together on the far side of the wagon sharing warmth Kaladin left them to it sitting alone with his back to the bars Kaladin didnt fear stories of things that walked the storms In the army hed been forced to weather a highstorm or two beneath the lip of a protective stone overhang or other bit of impromptu shelter Nobody liked to be out during a storm but sometimes you couldnt avoid it The things that walked the stormsperhaps even the Stormfather himselfwerent nearly so deadly as the rocks and branches cast up into the air In fact the storms initial tempest of water and windthe stormwallwas the most dangerous part The longer one endured after that the weaker the storm grew until the trailing edge was nothing more than sprinkling rain No he wasnt worried about Voidbringers looking for flesh to feast upon He was worried that something would happen to Tvlakv The slavemaster waited out the storm in a cramped wooden enclosure built into the bottom of his wagon That was ostensibly the safest place in the caravan but an unlucky twist of fatea tempestthrown boulder the collapse of the wagoncould leave him dead In that case Kaladin could see Bluth and Tag running off leaving everyone in their cages wooden sides locked up The slaves would die a slow death by starvation and dehydration baking under the sun in these boxes The storm continued to blow shaking the wagon Those winds felt like live things at times And who was to say they werent Were windspren attracted to gusts of wind or were they the gusts of wind The souls of the force that now wanted so badly to destroy Kaladins wagon That forcesentient or notfailed The wagons were chained to nearby boulders with their wheels locked The blasts of wind grew more lethargic Lightning stopped flashing and the maddening drumming of rain became a quiet tapping instead Only once during their journey had a wagon toppled during a highstorm Both it and the slaves inside had survived with a few dents and bruises The wooden side to Kaladins right shook suddenly then fell open as Bluth undid its clasps The mercenary wore his leather coat against the wet streams of water falling from the brim of his hat as he exposed the barsand the occupantsto the rain It was cold though not as piercingly so as during the height of the storm It sprayed across Kaladin and the huddled slaves Tvlakv always ordered the wagons uncovered before the rain stopped he said it was the only way to wash away the slaves stink Bluth slid the wooden side into place beneath the wagon then opened the other two sides Only the wall at the front of the wagonjust behind the drivers seatcouldnt be brought down Little early to be taking down the sides Bluth Kaladin said It wasnt quite the riddens yetthe period near the end of a highstorm when the rain sprinkled softly This rain was still heavy the wind still gusting on occasion The master wants you plenty clean today Why Kaladin asked rising water streaming from his ragged brown clothing Bluth ignored him Perhaps were nearing our destination Kaladin thought as he scanned the landscape Over the last few days the hills had given way to uneven rock formationsplaces where weathering winds had left behind crumbling cliffs and jagged shapes Grass grew up the rocky sides that saw the most sun and other plants were plentiful in the shade The time right after a highstorm was when the land was most alive Rockbud polyps split and sent out their vines Other kinds of vine crept from crevices licking up water Leaves unfolded from shrubs and trees Cremlings of all kinds slithered through puddles enjoying the banquet Insects buzzed into the air larger crustaceanscrabs and leggersleft their hiding places The very rocks seemed to come to life Kaladin noted a halfdozen windspren flitting overhead their translucent forms chasing afteror perhaps cruising along withthe highstorms last gusts Tiny lights rose around the plants Lifespren They looked like motes of glowing green dust or swarms of tiny translucent insects A leggerits hairlike spines lifted to the air to give warning of changes in the windclimbed along the side of the cart its long body lined with dozens of pairs of legs That was familiar enough but hed never seen a legger with such a deep purple carapace Where was Tvlakv taking the caravan Those uncultivated hillsides were perfect for farming You could spread stumpweight sap on themmixed with lavis seedsduring seasons of weaker storms following the Weeping In four months youd have polyps larger than a mans head growing all along the hill ready to break open for the grain inside The chulls lumbered about feasting on rockbuds slugs and smaller crustaceans that had appeared after the storm Tag and Bluth quietly hitched the beasts to their harnesses as a grumpylooking Tvlakv crawled out of his waterproof refuge The slavemaster pulled on a cap and deep black cloak against the rain He rarely came out until the storm had passed completely he was very eager to get to their destination Were they that close to the coast That was one of the only places where theyd find cities in the Unclaimed Hills Within minutes the wagons were rolling again across the uneven ground Kaladin settled back as the sky cleared the highstorm a smudge of blackness on the western horizon The sun brought welcome warmth and the slaves basked in the light streams of water dripping from their clothing and running out the back of the rocking wagon Presently a translucent ribbon of light zipped up to Kaladin He was coming to take the windsprens presence for granted She had gone out during the storm but shed come back As always I saw others of your kind Kaladin said idly Others she asked taking the form of a young woman She began to step around him in the air spinning occasionally dancing to some unheard beat Windspren Kaladin said Chasing after the storm Are you certain you dont want to go with them She glanced westward longingly No she finally said continuing her dance I like it here Kaladin shrugged Shed ceased playing as many pranks as she once had and so hed stopped letting her presence annoy him There are others near she said Others like you Slaves I dont know People Not the ones here Other ones Where She turned a translucent white finger pointing eastward There Many of them Lots and lots Kaladin stood up He couldnt imagine that a spren had a good handle on how to measure distance and numbers Yes Kaladin squinted studying the horizon Thats smoke From chimneys He caught a gust of it on the wind if not for the rain hed probably have smelled it sooner Should he care It didnt matter where he was a slave hed still be a slave Hed accepted this life That was his way now Dont care dont bother Still he watched with curiosity as his wagon climbed the side of a hill and gave the slaves inside a good vantage of what was ahead It wasnt a city It was something grander something larger An enormous army encampment Great Father of Storms Kaladin whispered Ten masses of troops bivouacked in familiar Alethi patternscircular by company rank with camp followers on the outskirts mercenaries in a ring just inside them citizen soldiers near the middle lighteyed officers at the very center They were camped in a series of enormous craterlike rock formations only the sides were more irregular more jagged Like broken eggshells Kaladin had left an army much like this eight months ago though Amarams force had been much smaller This one covered miles of stone stretching far both north and south A thousand banners bearing a thousand different family glyphpairs flapped proudly in the air There were some tentsmainly on the outside of the armiesbut most of the troops were housed in large stone barracks That meant Soulcasters That encampment directly ahead of them flew a banner Kaladin had seen in books Deep blue with white glyphskhokh and linil stylized and painted as a sword standing before a crown House Kholin The kings house Daunted Kaladin looked beyond the armies The landscape to the east was as hed heard it described in a dozen different stories detailing the kings campaign against the Parshendi betrayers It was an enormous riven plain of rockso wide he couldnt see the other sidethat was split and cut by sheer chasms crevasses twenty or thirty feet wide They were so deep that they disappeared into darkness and formed a jagged mosaic of uneven plateaus Some large others tiny The expansive plain looked like a platter that had been broken its pieces then reassembled with small gaps between the fragments The Shattered Plains Kaladin whispered What the windspren asked Whats wrong Kaladin shook his head bemused I spent years trying to get to this place Its what Tien wanted in the end at least To come here fight in the kings army And now Kaladin was here Finally Accidentally He felt like laughing at the absurdity I should have realized he thought I should have known We werent ever heading toward the coast and its cities We were heading here To war This place would be subject to Alethi law and rules Hed expected that Tvlakv would want to avoid such things But here hed probably also find the best prices The Shattered Plains one of the slaves said Really Others crowded around peering out In their sudden excitement they seemed to forget their fear of Kaladin It is the Shattered Plains another man said Thats the kings army Perhaps well find justice here another said I hear the kings house hold servants live as well as the finest merchants said another His slaves have to be better off too Well be in Vorin lands well even make wages That much was true When worked slaves had to be paid a small wagehalf what a nonslave would be paid which was already often less than a full citizen would make for the same work But it was something and Alethi law required it Only ardentswho couldnt own anything anywaydidnt have to be paid Well them and parshmen But parshmen were more animal than anything else A slave could apply his earnings to his slave debt and after years of labor earn his freedom Theoretically The others continued to chatter as the wagons rolled down the incline but Kaladin withdrew to the back of the wagon He suspected that the option to pay off a slaves price was a sham intended to keep slaves docile The debt was enormous far more than a slave sold for and virtually impossible to earn out Under previous masters hed demanded his wages be given to him They had always found ways to cheat himcharging him for his housing his food Thats how lighteyes were Roshone Amaram KatarotamEach lighteyes Kaladin had known whether as a slave or a free man had shown himself to be corrupt to the core for all his outward poise and beauty They were like rotting corpses clothed in beautiful silk The other slaves kept talking about the kings army and about justice Justice Kaladin thought resting back against the bars Im not convinced there is such a thing as justice Still he found himself wondering That was the kings armythe armies of all ten highprincescome to fulfill the Vengeance Pact If there was one thing he still let himself long for it was the chance to hold a spear To fight again to try and find his way back to the man he had been A man who had cared If he would find that anywhere hed find it here I have seen the end and have heard it named The Night of Sorrows the True Desolation The Everstorm Collected on the 1st of Nanes 1172 15 seconds predeath Subject was a darkeyed youth of unknown origin Shallan had not expected Jasnah Kholin to be so beautiful It was a stately mature beautyas one might find in the portrait of some historical scholar Shallan realized that shed naively been expecting Jasnah to be an ugly spinster like the stern matrons who had tutored her years ago How else could one picture a heretic well into her midthirties and still unmarried Jasnah was nothing like that She was tall and slender with clear skin narrow black eyebrows and thick deep onyx hair She wore part of it up wrapped around a small scrollshaped golden ornament with two long hairpins holding it in place The rest tumbled down behind her neck in small tight curls Even twisted and curled as it was it came down to Jasnahs shouldersif left unbound it would be as long as Shallans hair reaching past the middle of her back She had a squarish face and discriminating pale violet eyes She was listening to a man dressed in robes of burnt orange and white the Kharbranthian royal colors Brightness Kholin was several fingers taller than the manapparently the Alethi reputation for height was no exaggeration Jasnah glanced at Shallan noting her then returned to her conversation Stormfather This woman was the sister of a king Reserved statuesque dressed immaculately in blue and silver Like Shallans dress Jasnahs buttoned up the sides and had a high collar though Jasnah had a much fuller chest than Shallan The skirts were loose below the waist falling generously to the floor Her sleeves were long and stately and the left one was buttoned up to hide her safehand On her freehand was a distinctive piece of jewelry two rings and a bracelet connected by several chains holding a triangular group of gemstones across the back of the hand A Soulcasterthe word was used for both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it possible Shallan edged into the room trying to get a better look at the large glowing gemstones Her heart began to beat a little faster The Soulcaster looked identical to the one she and her brothers had found in the inside pocket of her fathers coat Jasnah and the man in robes began walking in Shallans direction still talking How would Jasnah react now that her ward had finally caught up to her Would she be angry because of Shallans tardiness Shallan couldnt be blamed for that but people often expect irrational things from their inferiors Like the grand cavern outside this hallway was cut from the rock but it was more richly furbished with ornate hanging chandeliers made with Stormlit gemstones Most were deep violet garnets which were among the less valuable stones Even so the sheer number hanging there glistening with violet light would make the chandelier worth a small fortune More than that however Shallan was impressed with the symmetry of the design and the beauty of the pattern of crystals hanging at the sides of the chandelier As Jasnah grew near Shallan could hear some of what she was saying realize that this action might prompt an unfavorable reaction from the devotaries the woman said speaking in Alethi It was very near to Shallans native Veden and shed been taught to speak it well during her childhood Yes Brightness said the robed man He was elderly with a wispy white beard and had pale grey eyes His open kindly face seemed very concerned and he wore a squat cylindrical hat that matched the orange and white of his robes Rich robes Was this some kind of royal steward perhaps No Those gemstones on his fingers the way he carried himself the way other lighteyed attendants deferred to himStormfather Shallan thought This has to be the king himself Not Jasnahs brother Elhokar but the king of Kharbranth Taravangian Shallan hastily performed an appropriate curtsy which Jasnah noted The ardents have much sway here Your Majesty Jasnah said with a smooth voice As do I the king said You neednt worry about me Very well Jasnah said Your terms are agreeable Lead me to the location and I shall see what can be done If you will excuse me as we walk however I have someone to attend to Jasnah made a curt motion toward Shallan waving her to join them Of course Brightness the king said He seemed to defer to Jasnah Kharbranth was a very small kingdomjust a single citywhile Alethkar was one of the worlds most powerful An Alethi princess might well outrank a Kharbranthian king in real terms however protocol would have it Shallan hurried to catch up to Jasnah who walked a little behind the king as he began to speak to his attendants Brightness Shallan said I am Shallan Davar whom you asked to meet you I deeply regret not being able to get to you in Dumadari The fault was not yours Jasnah said with a wave of the fingers I didnt expect that you would make it in time I wasnt certain where I would be going after Dumadari when I sent you that note however Jasnah wasnt angry that was a good sign Shallan felt some of her anxiety recede I am impressed by your tenacity child Jasnah continued I honestly didnt expect you to follow me this far After Kharbranth I was going to forgo leaving you notes as Id presumed that youd have given up Most do so after the first few stops Most Then it was a test of some sort And Shallan had passed Yes indeed Jasnah continued voice musing Perhaps I will actually allow you to petition me for a place as my ward Shallan almost stumbled in shock Petition her Wasnt that what shed already done Brightness Shallan said I thought thatWell your letter Jasnah eyed her I gave you leave to meet me Miss Davar I did not promise to take you on The training and care of a ward is a distraction for which I have little tolerance or time at the present But you have traveled far I will entertain your request though understand that my requirements are strict Shallan covered a grimace No tantrum Jasnah noted That is a good sign Tantrum Brightness From a lighteyed woman Youd be surprised Jasnah said dryly But attitude alone will not earn your place Tell me how extensive is your education Extensive in some areas Shallan said Then she hesitantly added Extensively lacking in others Very well Jasnah said Ahead the king seemed to be in a hurry but he was old enough that even an urgent walk was still slow Then we shall do an evaluation Answer truthfully and do not exaggerate as I will soon discover your lies Feign no false modesty either I havent the patience for a simperer Yes Brightness We shall begin with music How would you judge your skill I have a good ear Brightness Shallan said honestly Im best with voice though I have been trained on the zither and the pipes I would be far from the best youd heard but Id also be far from the worst I know most historical ballads by heart Give me the refrain from Lilting Adrene Here Im not fond of repeating myself child Shallan blushed but began to sing It wasnt her finest performance but her tone was pure and she didnt stumble over any of the words Good Jasnah said as Shallan paused for a breath Languages Shallan fumbled for a moment bringing her attention away from frantically trying to remember the next verse Languages I can speak your native Alethi obviously Shallan said I have a passable reading knowledge of Thaylen and good spoken Azish I can make myself understood in Selay but not read it Jasnah made no comment either way Shallan began to grow nervous Writing Jasnah asked I know all of the major minor and topical glyphs and can paint them calligraphically So can most children The glyphwards that I paint are regarded by those who know me as quite impressive Glyphwards Jasnah said I had reason to believe you wanted to be a scholar not a purveyor of superstitious nonsense I have kept a journal since I was a child Shallan continued in order to practice my writing skills Congratulations Jasnah said Should I need someone to write a treatise on their stuffed pony or give an account of an interesting pebble they discovered I shall send for you Is there nothing you can offer that shows you have true skill Shallan blushed With all due respect Brightness you have a letter from me yourself and it was persuasive enough to make you grant me this audience A valid point Jasnah said nodding It took you long enough to make it How is your training in logic and its related arts I am accomplished in basic mathematics Shallan said still flustered and I often helped with minor accounts for my father I have read through the complete works of Tormas Nashan Niali the Just andof courseNohadon Placini Who No Gabrathin Yustara Manaline Syasikk ShaukadaughterHasweth Shallan cringed and shook her head again That last name was obviously Shin Did the Shin people even have logicmasters Did Jasnah really expect her wards to have studied such obscure texts I see Jasnah said Well what of history History Shallan shrank down even further IThis is one of the areas where Im obviously deficient Brightness My father was never able to find a suitable tutor for me I read the history books he owned Which were The entire set of Barlesha Lhans Topics mostly Jasnah waved her freehand dismissively Barely worth the time spent scribing them A popular survey of historical events at best I apologize Brightness This is an embarrassing hole History is the most important of the literary subarts One would think that your parents would have taken specific care in this area if theyd hoped to submit you to study under a historian like myself My circumstances are unusual Brightness Ignorance is hardly unusual Miss Davar The longer I live the more I come to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind There are many who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be impressed with their efforts Shallan blushed again Shed realized she had some deficiencies but Jasnah had unreasonable expectations She said nothing continuing to walk beside the taller woman How long was this hallway anyway She was so flustered she didnt even look at the paintings they passed They turned a corner walking deeper into the mountainside Well let us move on to science then Jasnah said tone displeased What can you say of yourself there I have the reasonable foundation in the sciences you might expect of a young woman my age Shallan said more stiffly than she would have liked Which means I can speak with skill about geography geology physics and chemistry Ive made particular study of biology and botany as I was able to pursue them with a reasonable level of independence on my fathers estates But if you expect me to be able to solve Fabrisans Conundrum with a wave of my hand I suspect you shall be disappointed Have I not a right to make reasonable demands of my potential students Miss Davar Reasonable Your demands are about as reasonable as the ones made of the Ten Heralds on Proving Day With all due respect Brightness you seem to want potential wards to be master scholars already I may be able to find a pair of eightyyearold ardents in the city who might fit your requirements They could interview for the position though they may have trouble hearing well enough to answer your questions I see Jasnah replied And do you speak with such pique to your parents as well Shallan winced Her time spent with the sailors had loosened her tongue far too much Had she traveled all this way only to off end Jasnah She thought of her brothers destitute keeping up a tenuous façade back home Would she have to return to them in defeat having squandered this opportunity I did not speak to them this way Brightness Nor should I to you I apologize Well at least you are humble enough to admit fault Still I am disappointed How is it that your mother considered you ready for a wardship My mother passed away when I was just a child Brightness And your father soon remarried Malise Gevelmar I believe Shallan started at her knowledge House Davar was ancient but only of middling power and importance The fact that Jasnah knew the name of Shallans stepmother said a lot about her My stepmother passed away recently She didnt send me to be your ward I took this initiative upon myself My condolences Jasnah said Perhaps you should be with your father seeing to his estates and comforting him rather than wasting my time The men walking ahead turned down another side passage Jasnah and Shallan followed entering a smaller corridor with an ornate red and yellow rug mirrors hanging on the walls Shallan turned to Jasnah My father has no need of me Well that was true But I have great need of you as this interview itself has proven If ignorance galls you so much can you in good conscience pass up the opportunity to rid me of mine Ive done so before Miss Davar You are the twelfth young woman to ask me for a wardship this year Twelve Shallan thought In one year And shed assumed that women would stay away from Jasnah because of her antagonism toward the devotaries The group reached the end of the narrow hallway turning a corner to findto Shallans surprisea place where a large chunk of rock had fallen from the ceiling A dozen or so attendants stood here some looking anxious What was going on Much of the rubble had evidently been cleared away though the gouge in the ceiling gaped ominously It didnt look out on the sky they had been progressing downward and were probably far underground A massive stone taller than a man had fallen into a doorway on the left There was no getting past it into the room beyond Shallan thought she heard sounds on the other side The king stepped up to the stone speaking in a comforting voice He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his aged brow The dangers of living in a building cut directly into the rock Jasnah said striding forward When did this happen Apparently she hadnt been summoned to the city specifically for this purpose the king was simply taking advantage of her presence During the recent highstorm Brightness the king said He shook his head making his drooping thin white mustache tremble The palace architects might be able to cut a way into the room but it would take time and the next highstorm is scheduled to hit in just a few days Beyond that breaking in might bring down more of the ceiling I thought Kharbranth was protected from the highstorms Your Majesty Shallan said causing Jasnah to shoot her a glance The city is sheltered young woman the king said But the stone mountain behind us is buffeted quite strongly Sometimes it causes avalanches on that side and that can cause the entire mountainside to shake He glanced at the ceiling Caveins are very rare and we thought this area was quite safe but But it is rock Jasnah said and there is no telling if a weak vein lurks just beyond the surface She inspected the monolith that had fallen from the ceiling This will be difficult I will probably lose a very valuable focal stone I the king began wiping his brow again If only we had a Shardblade Jasnah cut him off with a wave of the hand I was not seeking to renegotiate our bargain Your Majesty Access to the Palanaeum is worth the cost You will want to send someone for wet rags Have the majority of the servants move down to the other end of the hallway You may wish to wait there yourself I will stay here the king said causing his attendants to object including a large man wearing a black leather cuirass probably his bodyguard The king silenced them by raising his wrinkled hand I will not hide like a coward when my granddaughter is trapped No wonder he was so anxious Jasnah didnt argue further and Shallan could see from her eyes that it was of no consequence to her if the king risked his life The same apparently went for Shallan for Jasnah didnt order her away Servants approached with wetted cloths and distributed them Jasnah refused hers The king and his bodyguard raised theirs to their faces covering mouth and nose Shallan took hers What was the point of it A couple of servants passed some wet cloths through a space between the rock and the wall to those inside Then all of the servants rushed away down the hallway Jasnah picked and prodded at the boulder Miss Davar she said what method would you use to ascertain the mass of this stone Shallan blinked Well I suppose Id ask His Majesty His architects probably calculated it Jasnah cocked her head An elegant response Did they do that Your Majesty Yes Brightness Kholin the king said Its roughly fifteen thousand kavals Jasnah eyed Shallan A point in your favor Miss Davar A scholar knows not to waste time rediscovering information already known Its a lesson I sometimes forget Shallan felt herself swell at the words She already had an inkling that Jasnah did not give such praise lightly Did this mean that the woman was still considering her as a ward Jasnah held up her freehand Soulcaster glistening against the skin Shallan felt her heartbeat speed up Shed never seen Soulcasting done in person The ardents were very secretive in using their fabrials and she hadnt even known that her father had one until theyd found it on him Of course his no longer worked That was one of the main reasons she was here The gemstones set into Jasnahs Soulcaster were enormous some of the largest that Shallan had ever seen worth many spheres each One was smokestone a pure glassy black gemstone The second was a diamond The third was a ruby All three were cuta cut stone could hold more Stormlightinto glistening manyfaceted oval shapes Jasnah closed her eyes pressing her hand against the fallen boulder She raised her head inhaling slowly The stones on the back of her hand began to glow more fiercely the smokestone in particular growing so bright it was difficult to look at Shallan held her breath The only thing she dared do was blink committing the scene to memory For a long extended moment nothing happened And then briefly Shallan heard a sound A low thrumming like a distant group of voices humming together a single pure note Jasnahs hand sank into the rock The stone vanished A burst of dense black smoke exploded into the hallway Enough to blind Shallan it seemed the output of a thousand fires and smelled of burned wood Shallan hastily raised the wet rag to her face dropping to her knees Oddly her ears felt stopped up as if shed climbed down from a great height She had to swallow to pop them She shut her eyes tightly as they began to water and she held her breath Her ears filled with a rushing sound It passed She blinked open her eyes to find the king and his bodyguard huddled against the wall beside to her Smoke still pooled at the ceiling the hallway smelled strongly of it Jasnah stood eyes still closed oblivious of the smokethough grime now dusted her face and clothing It had left marks on the walls too Shallan had read of this but she was still in awe Jasnah had transformed the boulder into smoke and since smoke was far less dense than stone the change had pushed the smoke away in an explosive outburst It was true Jasnah really did have a functioning Soulcaster And a powerful one too Nine out of ten Soulcasters were capable of a few limited transformations creating water or grain from stone forming bland singleroomed rock buildings out of air or cloth A greater one like Jasnahs could effectuate any transformation Literally turn any substance into any other one How it must grate on the ardents that such a powerful holy relic was in the hands of someone outside the ardentia And a heretic no less Shallan stumbled to her feet leaving the cloth at her mouth breathing humid but dustfree air She swallowed her ears popping again as the halls pressure returned to normal A moment later the king rushed into the nowaccessible room A small girlalong with several nursemaids and other palace servantssat on the other side coughing The king pulled the girl into his arms She was too young to have a modesty sleeve Jasnah opened her eyes blinking as if momentarily confused by her location She took a deep breath and didnt cough Indeed she actually smiled as if enjoying the scent of the smoke Jasnah turned to Shallan focusing on her You are still waiting for a response Im afraid you will not like what I say But you havent finished your testing of me yet Shallan said forcing herself to be bold Surely you wont give judgment until you have I havent finished Jasnah asked frowning You didnt ask me about all of the feminine arts You left out painting and drawing I have never had much use for them But they are of the arts Shallan said feeling desperate This was where she was most accomplished Many consider the visual arts the most refined of them all I brought my portfolio I would show you what I can do Jasnah pursed her lips The visual arts are frivolity I have weighed the facts child and I can not accept you Im sorry Shallans heart sank Your Majesty Jasnah said to the king I would like to go to the Palanaeum Now the king said cradling his granddaughter But we are going to have a feast I appreciate the offer Jasnah said but I find myself with an abundance of everything but time Of course the king said I will take you personally Thank you for what youve done When I heard that you had requested entrance He continued to babble at Jasnah who followed him wordlessly down the hallway leaving Shallan behind She clutched her satchel to her chest lowering the cloth from her mouth Six months of chasing for this She gripped the rag in frustration squeezing sooty water between her fingers She wanted to cry That was what she probably would have done if shed been that same child she had been six months ago But things had changed She had changed If she failed House Davar would fall Shallan felt her determination redouble though she wasnt able to stop a few tears of frustration from squeezing out of the corners of her eyes She was not going to give up until Jasnah was forced to truss her up in chains and have the authorities drag her away Her step surprisingly firm she walked in the direction Jasnah had gone Six months ago she had explained a desperate plan to her brothers She would apprentice herself to Jasnah Kholin scholar heretic Not for the education Not for the prestige But in order to learn where she kept her Soulcaster And then Shallan would steal it Charcoal rubbing of a map of Sadeass warcamp as used by a commom spearman It was scrarched on the back of a palmsized cremling shell Rubbing labeled in ink by an anonymous Alethi scholar circa 1173 Im cold Mother Im cold Mother Why can I still hear the rain Will it stop Collected on Vevishes 1172 32 seconds predeath Subject was a lighteyed female child approximately six years old Tvlakv released all of the slaves from their cages at once This time he didnt fear runaways or a slave rebellionnot with nothing but wilderness behind them and over a hundred thousand armed soldiers just ahead Kaladin stepped down from the wagon They were inside one of the craterlike formations its jagged stone wall rising just to the east The ground had been cleared of plant life and the rock was slick beneath his unshod feet Pools of rainwater had gathered in depressions The air was crisp and clean and the sun strong overhead though with this Eastern humidity he always felt damp Around them spread the signs of an army long settled this war had been going on since the old kings death nearly six years ago Everyone told stories of that night the night when Parshendi tribesmen had murdered King Gavilar Squads of soldiers marched by following directions indicated by painted circles at each intersection The camp was packed with long stone bunkers and there were more tents than Kaladin had discerned from above Soulcasters couldnt be used to create every shelter After the stink of the slave caravan the place smelled good brimming with familiar scents like treated leather and oiled weapons However many of the soldiers had a disorderly look They werent dirty but they didnt seem particularly disciplined either They roamed the camp in packs with coats undone Some pointed and jeered at the slaves This was the army of a highprince The elite force that fought for Alethkars honor This was what Kaladin had aspired to join Bluth and Tag watched carefully as Kaladin lined up with the other slaves but he didnt try anything Now was not the time to provoke themKaladin had seen how mercenaries acted when around commissioned troops Bluth and Tag played their part walking with their chests out and hands on their weapons They shoved a few of the slaves into place ramming a cudgel into one mans belly and cursing him gruffly They stayed clear of Kaladin The kings army said the slave next to him It was the darkskinned man who had talked to Kaladin about escaping I thought we were meant for mine work Why this wont be so bad at all Well be cleaning latrines or maintaining roads Odd to look forward to latrine work or labor in the hot sun Kaladin hoped for something else Hoped Yes hed discovered that he could still hope A spear in his hands An enemy to face He could live like that Tvlakv spoke with an importantlooking lighteyed woman She wore her dark hair up in a complex weave sparkling with infused amethysts and her dress was a deep crimson She looked much as Laral had at the end She was probably of the fourth or fifth dahn wife and scribe to one of the camps officers Tvlakv began to brag about his wares but the woman raised a delicate hand I can see what I am purchasing slaver she said in a smooth aristocratic accent I will inspect them myself She began to walk down the line accompanied by several soldiers Her dress was cut in the Alethi noble fashiona solid swath of silk tight and formfitting through the top with sleek skirts below It buttoned up the sides of the torso from waist to neck where it was topped by a small goldembroidered collar The longer left cuff hid her safehand Kaladins mother had always just worn a glove which seemed far more practical to him Judging by her face she was not particularly impressed with what she saw These men are halfstarved and sickly she said taking a thin rod from a young female attendant She used it to lift the hair from one mans forehead inspecting his brand You are asking two emerald broams a head Tvlakv began to sweat Perhaps one and a half And what would I use them for I wouldnt trust men this filthy near food and we have parshmen to do most other work If Your Ladyship is not pleased I could approach other highprinces No she said smacking the slave shed been regarding as he shied away from her One and a quarter They can help cut timber for us in the northern forests She trailed off as she noticed Kaladin Here now This is far better stock than the others I thought that you might like this one Tvlakv said stepping up to her He is quite She raised the rod and silenced Tvlakv She had a small sore on one lip Some ground cussweed root could help with that Remove your top slave she commanded Kaladin stared her right in her blue eyes and felt an almost irresistible urge to spit at her No No he couldnt afford that Not when there was a chance He pulled his arms out of the sacklike clothing letting it fall to his waist exposing his chest Despite eight months as a slave he was far better muscled than the others A large number of scars for one so young the noblewoman said thoughtfully You are a military man Yes His windspren zipped up to the woman inspecting her face Mercenary Amarams army Kaladin said A citizen second nahn Once a citizen Tvlakv put in quickly He was She silenced Tvlakv again with her rod glaring at him Then she used the rod to push aside Kaladins hair and inspect his forehead Shash glyph she said clicking her tongue Several of the soldiers nearby stepped closer hands on their swords Where I come from slaves who deserve these are simply executed They are fortunate Kaladin said And how did you end up here I killed someone Kaladin said preparing his lies carefully Please he thought to the Heralds Please It had been a long time since he had prayed for anything The woman raised an eyebrow Im a murderer Brightness Kaladin said Got drunk made some mistakes But I can use a spear as well as any man Put me in your brightlords army Let me fight again It was a strange lie to make but the woman would never let Kaladin fight if she thought he was a deserter In this case better to be known as an accidental murderer Please he thought To be a soldier again It seemed in one moment the most glorious thing he could ever have wanted How much better it would be to die on the battlefield than waste away emptying chamber pots To the side Tvlakv stepped up beside the lighteyed woman He glanced at Kaladin then sighed Hes a deserter Brightness Dont listen to him No Kaladin felt a blazing burst of anger consume his hope He raised hands toward Tvlakv Hed strangle the rat and Something cracked him across the back He grunted stumbling and falling to one knee The noblewoman stepped back raising her safehand to her breast in alarm One of the army soldiers grabbed Kaladin and towed him back to his feet Well she finally said That is unfortunate I can fight Kaladin growled against the pain Give me a spear Let me She raised her rod cutting him off Brightness Tvlakv said not meeting Kaladins eyes I would not trust him with a weapon It is true that he is a murderer but he is also known to disobey and lead rebellions against his masters I couldnt sell him to you as a bonded soldier My conscience it would not allow it He hesitated The men in his wagon he might have corrupted them all with talk of escape My honor demands that I tell you this Kaladin gritted his teeth He was tempted to try to take down the soldier behind him grab that spear and spend his last moments ramming it through Tvlakvs portly gut Why What did it matter to Tvlakv how Kaladin was treated by this army I should never have ripped up the map Kaladin though Bitterness is repaid more often than kindness One of his fathers sayings The woman nodded moving on Show me which ones she said Ill still take them because of your honesty We need some new bridgemen Tvlakv nodded eagerly Before moving on he paused and leaned in to Kaladin I can not trust that you will behave The people in this army they will blame a merchant for not revealing all he knew Iam sorry With that the merchant scuttled away Kaladin growled in the back of his throat and then pulled himself free of the soldiers but remained in line So be it Cutting down trees building bridges fighting in the army None of it mattered He would just keep living Theyd taken his freedom his family his friends andmost dear of allhis dreams They could do nothing more to him After her inspection the noblewoman took a writing board from her assistant and made a few quick notations on its paper Tvlakv gave her a ledger detailing how much each slave had paid down on their slave debt Kaladin caught a glimpse it said that not a single one of the men had paid anything Perhaps Tvlakv lied about the figures Not unlikely Kaladin would probably just let all of his wages go to his debt this time Let them squirm as they saw him actually call their bluff What would they do if he got close to earning out his debt Hed probably never find outdepending on what these bridgemen earned it could take anything from ten to fifty years to get there The lighteyed woman assigned most of the slaves to forest duty A halfdozen of the more spindly ones were sent to work the mess halls despite what shed said before Those ten the noblewoman said raising her rod to point at Kaladin and the others from his wagon Take them to the bridge crews Tell Lamaril and Gaz that the tall one is to be given special treatment The soldiers laughed and one began shoving Kaladins group along the pathway Kaladin endured it these men had no reason to be gentle and he wouldnt give them a reason to be rougher If there was a group citizen soldiers hated more than mercenaries it was deserters As he walked he couldnt help noticing the banner flying above the camp It bore the same symbol emblazoned on the soldiers uniform coats a yellow glyphpair in the shape of a tower and a hammer on a field of deep green That was the banner of Highprince Sadeas ultimate ruler of Kaladins own home district Was it irony or fate that had landed Kaladin here Soldiers lounged idly even those who appeared to be on duty and the camp streets were littered with refuse Camp followers were plentiful whores worker women coopers chandlers and wranglers There were even children running through the streets of what was half city half warcamp There were also parshmen Carrying water working on trenches lifting sacks That surprised him Werent they fighting parshmen Werent they worried that these would rise up Apparently not The parshmen here worked with the same docility as the ones back in Hearthstone Perhaps it made sense Alethi had fought against Alethi back in his armies at home so why shouldnt there be parshmen on both sides of this conflict The soldiers took Kaladin all the way around to the northeastern quarter of the camp a hike that took some time Though the Soulcast stone barracks each looked exactly the same the rim of the camp was broken distinctively like ragged mountains Old habits made him memorize the route Here the towering circular wall had been worn away by countless highstorms giving a clear view eastward That open patch of ground would make a good staging area for an army to gather on before marching down the incline to the Shattered Plains themselves The northern edge of the field contained a subcamp filled with several dozen barracks and at their center a lumberyard filled with carpenters They were breaking down some of the stout trees Kaladin had seen on the plains outside stripping off their stringy bark sawing them into planks Another group of carpenters assembled the planks into large contraptions Were to be woodworkers Kaladin asked One of the soldiers laughed roughly Youre joining the bridge crews He pointed to where a group of sorrylooking men sat on the stones in the shade of a barrack scooping food out of wooden bowls with their fingers It looked depressingly similar to the slop that Tvlakv had fed them One of the soldiers shoved Kaladin forward again and he stumbled down the shallow incline and crossed the grounds The other nine slaves followed herded by the soldiers None of the men sitting around the barracks so much as glanced at them They wore leather vests and simple trousers some with dirty laced shirts others barechested The grim sorry lot werent much better than the slaves though they did look to be in slightly better physical condition New recruits Gaz one of the soldiers called A man lounged in the shade a distance from the eating men He turned revealing a face that was so scarred his beard grew in patches He was missing one eyethe other was brownand didnt bother with an eye patch White knots at his shoulders marked him as a sergeant and he had the lean toughness Kaladin had learned to associate with someone who knew his way around a battlefield These spindly things Gaz said chewing on something as he walked over Theyll barely stop an arrow The soldier beside Kaladin shrugged shoving him forward once more for good measure Brightness Hashal said to do something special with this one The rest are up to you The soldier nodded to his companions and they began to trot away Gaz looked the slaves over He focused on Kaladin last I have military training Kaladin said In the army of Highlord Amaram I dont really care Gaz cut in spitting something dark to the side Kaladin hesitated When Amaram You keep mentioning that name Gaz snapped Served under some unimportant landlord did you Expect me to be impressed Kaladin sighed Hed met this kind of man before a lesser sergeant with no hope of advancement His only pleasure in life came from his authority over those even sorrier than himself Well so be it You have a slaves mark Gaz said snorting I doubt you ever held a spear Either way youll have to condescend to join us now Lordship Kaladins windspren flitted down and inspected Gaz then closed one of her eyes imitating him For some reason seeing her made Kaladin smile Gaz misinterpreted the smile The man scowled and stepped forward pointing At that moment a loud chorus of horns echoed through the camp Carpenters glanced up and the soldiers who had guided Kaladin dashed back toward the center of camp The slaves behind Kaladin looked around anxiously Stormfather Gaz cursed Bridgemen Up up you louts He began kicking at some of the men who were eating They scattered their bowls scrambling to their feet They wore simple sandals instead of proper boots You Lordship Gaz said pointing at Kaladin I didnt say I dont care what in Damnation you said Youre in Bridge Four He pointed at a group of departing bridgemen The rest of you go wait over there Ill divide you up later Get moving or Ill see you strung up by your heels Kaladin shrugged and jogged after the group of bridgemen It was one of many teams of such men pouring out of barracks or picking themselves up out of alleys There seemed to be quite a lot of them Around fifty barracks withperhapstwenty or thirty men in eachthat would make nearly as many bridgemen in this army as there had been soldiers in Amarams entire force Kaladins team crossed the grounds weaving between boards and piles of sawdust approaching a large wooden contraption It had obviously weathered a few highstorms and some battles The dents and holes scattered along its length looked like places where arrows had struck The bridge in bridgeman perhaps Yes Kaladin thought It was a wooden bridge around thirty feet long eight feet wide It sloped down at the front and back and had no railings The wood was thick with the largest boards for support through the center There were some forty or fifty bridges lined up here Perhaps one for each barrack making one crew for each bridge About twenty bridge crews were gathering at this point Gaz had found himself a wooden shield and a gleaming mace but there were none for anyone else He quickly inspected each team He stopped beside Bridge Four and hesitated Wheres your bridgeleader he demanded Dead one of the bridgemen said Tossed himself down the Honor Chasm last night Gaz cursed Cant you keep a bridgeleader for even a week Storm it Line up Ill run near you Listen for my commands Well sort out another bridgeleader after we see who survives Gaz pointed at Kaladin Youre at the back lordling The rest of you get moving Storm you I wont suffer another reprimand because of you fools Move move The others were lifting Kaladin had no choice but to go to the open slot at the tail of the bridge Hed been a little low in his assessment looked like about thirtyfive to forty men per bridge There was room for five men acrossthree under the bridge and one on each sideand eight deep though this crew didnt have a man for each position He helped lift the bridge into the air They were probably using a very light wood for the bridges but the thing was still stormscursed heavy Kaladin grunted as he struggled with the weight hoisting the bridge up high and then stepping underneath Men dashed in to fill the middle slots down the length of the structure and slowly they all set the bridge down on their shoulders At least there were rods on the bottom to use as handholds The other men had pads on the shoulders of their vests to cushion the weight and adjust their height to fit the supports Kaladin hadnt been given a vest so the wooden supports dug directly into his skin He couldnt see a thing there was an indentation for his head but wood cut off his view to all sides The men at the edges had better views he suspected those spots were more coveted The wood smelled of oil and sweat Go Gaz said from outside voice muffled Kaladin grunted as the crew broke into a jog He couldnt see where he was going and struggled to keep from tripping as the bridge crew marched down the eastern slope to the Shattered Plains Soon Kaladin was sweating and cursing under his breath the wood rubbing and digging into the skin on his shoulders He was already starting to bleed Poor fool a voice said from the side Kaladin glanced to the right but the wooden handholds obstructed his view Are you Kaladin puffed Are you talking to me You shouldnt have insulted Gaz the man said His voice sounded hollow He sometimes lets new men run in an outside row Sometimes Kaladin tried to respond but he was already gasping for breath Hed thought himself in better shape than this but hed spent eight months being fed slop being beaten and waiting out highstorms in leaking cellars muddy barns or cages He was hardly the same man anymore Breathe in and out deeply said the muffled voice Focus on the steps Count them It helps Kaladin followed the advice He could hear other bridge crews running nearby Behind them came the familiar sounds of men marching and hoofbeats on the stone They were being followed by an army Below rockbuds and small shalebark ridges grew from the stone tripping him The landscape of the Shattered Plains appeared to be broken uneven and rent covered with outcroppings and shelves of rock That explained why they didnt use wheels on the bridgesporters were probably much faster over such rough terrain Soon his feet were ragged and battered Couldnt they have given him shoes He set his jaw against the agony and kept on going Just another job He would continue and he would survive A thumping sound His feet fell on wood A bridge a permanent one crossing a chasm between plateaus on the Shattered Plains In seconds the bridge crew was across it and his feet fell on stone again Move move Gaz bellowed Storm you keep going They continued jogging as the army crossed the bridge behind them hundreds of boots resounding on the wood Before too long blood ran down Kaladins shoulders His breathing was torturous his side aching painfully He could hear others gasping the sounds carrying through the confined space beneath the bridge So he wasnt the only one Hopefully they would arrive at their destination quickly He hoped in vain The next hour was torture It was worse than any beating hed suffered as a slave worse than any wound on the battlefield There seemed to be no end to the march Kaladin vaguely remembered seeing the permanent bridges back when hed looked down on the plains from the slave cart They connected the plateaus where the chasms were easiest to span not where it would be most efficient for those traveling That often meant detours north or south before they could continue eastward The bridgemen grumbled cursed groaned then fell silent They crossed bridge after bridge plateau after plateau Kaladin never got a good look at one of the chasms He just kept running And running He couldnt feel his feet any longer He kept running He knew somehow that if he stopped hed be beaten He felt as if his shoulders had been rubbed to the bone He tried counting steps but was too exhausted even for that But he didnt stop running Finally mercifully Gaz called for them to halt Kaladin blinked stumbling to a stop and nearly collapsing Lift Gaz bellowed The men lifted Kaladins arms straining at the motion after so much time holding the bridge in one place Drop They stepped aside the bridgemen underneath taking handholds at the sides It was awkward and difficult but these men had practice apparently They kept the bridge from toppling as they set it on the ground Push Kaladin stumbled back in confusion as the men pushed at their handholds on the side or back of the bridge They were at the edge of a chasm lacking a permanent bridge To the sides the other bridge crews were pushing their own bridges forward Kaladin glanced over his shoulder The army was two thousand men in forest green and pure white Twelve hundred darkeyed spearmen several hundred cavalry atop rare precious horses Behind them a large group of heavy foot lighteyed men in thick armor and carrying large maces and square steel shields It seemed that theyd intentionally chosen a point where the chasm was narrow and the first plateau was a little higher than the second The bridge was twice as long as the chasms width here Gaz cursed at him so Kaladin joined the others shoving the bridge across the rough ground with a scraping sound When the bridge thumped into place on the other side of the chasm the bridge crew drew back to let the cavalry trot across He was too exhausted to watch He collapsed to the stones and lay back listening to sounds of foot soldiers tromping across the bridge He rolled his head to the side The other bridgemen had lain down as well Gaz walked among the various crews shaking his head his shield on his back as he muttered about their worthlessness Kaladin longed to lie there staring at the sky oblivious of the world His training however warned that might cause him to cramp up That would make the return trip even worse That trainingit belonged to another man from another time Almost from the shadowdays But while Kaladin might not be him any longer he could still heed him And so with a groan Kaladin forced himself to sit up and begin rubbing his muscles Soldiers crossed the bridge four across spears held high shields forward Gaz watched them with obvious envy and Kaladins windspren danced around the mans head Despite his fatigue Kaladin felt a moment of jealousy Why was she bothering that blowhard instead of Kaladin After a few minutes Gaz noticed Kaladin and scowled at him Hes wondering why you arent lying down said a familiar voice The man who had been running beside Kaladin lay on the ground a short distance away staring up at the sky He was older with greying hair and he had a long leathery face to complement his kindly voice He looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt Kaladin kept rubbing his legs pointedly ignoring Gaz Then he ripped off some portions of his sacklike clothing and bound his feet and shoulders Fortunately he was accustomed to walking barefoot as a slave so the damage wasnt too bad As he finished the last of the foot soldiers passed over the bridge They were followed by several mounted lighteyes in gleaming armor At their center rode a man in majestic burnished red Shardplate It was distinct from the one other Kaladin had seeneach suit was said to be an individual work of artbut it had the same feel Ornate interlocking topped by a beautiful helm with an open visor The armor felt alien somehow It had been crafted in another epoch a time when gods had walked Roshar Is that the king Kaladin asked The leathery bridgeman laughed tiredly We could only wish Kaladin turned toward him frowning If that were the king the bridgeman said then that would mean we were in Brightlord Dalinars army The name was vaguely familiar to Kaladin Hes a highprince right The kings uncle Aye The best of men the most honorable Shardbearer in the kings army They say hes never broken his word Kaladin sniffed in disdain Much the same had been said about Amaram You should wish to be in Highprince Dalinars force lad the older man said He doesnt use bridge crews Not like these at least All right you cremlings Gaz bellowed On your feet The bridgemen groaned stumbling upright Kaladin sighed The brief rest had been just enough to show how exhausted he was Ill be glad to get back he muttered Back the leathery bridgeman said We arent turning around His friend chuckled wryly Lad we arent nearly there yet Be glad we arent Arriving is the worst part And so the nightmare began its second phase They crossed the bridge pulled it over behind them then lifted it up on sore shoulders once more They jogged across the plateau At the other side they lowered the bridge again to span another chasm The army crossed then it was back to carrying the bridge again They repeated this a good dozen times They did get to rest between carries but Kaladin was so sore and overworked that the brief respites werent enough He barely caught his breath each time before being forced to pick up the bridge again They were expected to be quick about it The bridgemen got to rest while the army crossed but they had to make up the time by jogging across the plateauspassing the ranks of soldiersso that they could arrive at the next chasm before the army At one point his leatheryfaced friend warned him that if they didnt have their bridge in place quickly enough theyd be punished with whippings when they returned to camp Gaz gave orders cursing the bridgemen kicking them when they moved too slowly never doing any real work It didnt take long for Kaladin to nurture a seething hatred of the scrawny scarfaced man That was odd he hadnt felt hatred for his other sergeants It was their job to curse at the men and keep them motivated That wasnt what burned Kaladin Gaz had sent him on this trip without sandals or a vest Despite his bandages Kaladin would bear scars from his work this day Hed be so bruised and stiff in the morning that hed be unable to walk What Gaz had done was the mark of a petty bully He risked the mission by losing a carrier all because of a hasty grudge Storming man Kaladin thought using his hatred of Gaz to sustain him through the ordeal Several times after pushing the bridge into place Kaladin collapsed feeling sure hed never be able to stand again But when Gaz called for them to rise Kaladin somehow struggled to his feet It was either that or let Gaz win Why were they going through all of this What was the point Why were they running so much They had to protect their bridge the precious weight the cargo They had to hold up the sky and run they had to He was growing delirious Feet running One two one two one two Stop He stopped Lift He raised his hands up Drop He stepped back then lowered the bridge Push He pushed the bridge Die That last command was his own added each time He fell back to the stone a rockbud hastily withdrawing its vines as he touched them He closed his eyes no longer able to care about cramps He entered a trance a kind of half sleep for what seemed like one heartbeat Rise He stood stumbling on bloody feet Cross He crossed not bothering to look at the deadly drop on either side Pull He grabbed a handhold and pulled the bridge across the chasm after him Switch Kaladin stood up dumbly He didnt understand that command Gaz had never given it before The troops were forming ranks moving with that mixture of skittishness and forced relaxation that men often went through before a battle A few anticipationsprenlike red streamers growing from the ground and whipping in the windbegan to sprout from the rock and wave among the soldiers A battle Gaz grabbed Kaladins shoulder and shoved him to the front of the bridge Newcomers get to go first at this part Your Lordship The sergeant smiled wickedly Kaladin dumbly picked up the bridge with the others raising it over his head The handholds were the same here but this front row had a notched opening before his face allowing him to see out All of the bridgemen had changed positions the men who had been running in the front moved to the back and those at the backincluding Kaladin and the leatheryfaced bridgemanmoved to the front Kaladin didnt ask the point of it He didnt care He liked the front though jogging was easier now that he could see ahead of him The landscape on the plateaus was that of rough stormlands there were scattered patches of grass but the stone here was too hard for their seeds to fully burrow into Rockbuds were more common growing like bubbles across the entire plateau imitating rocks about the size of a mans head Many of the buds were split trailing out their vines like thick green tongues A few were even in bloom After so many hours breathing in the stuffy confines beneath the bridge running in the front was almost relaxing Why had they given such a wonderful position to a newcomer TalenelatElin bearer of all agonies said the man to his right voice horrified Its going to be a bad one Theyre already lined up Its going to be a bad one Kaladin blinked focusing on the approaching chasm On the other side of the rift stood a rank of men with marbled crimson and black skin They were wearing a strange rusty orange armor that covered their forearms chests heads and legs It took his numbed mind a moment to understand The Parshendi They werent like common parshman workers They were far more muscular far more solid They had the bulky build of soldiers and each one carried a weapon strapped to his back Some wore dark red and black beards tied with bits of rock while others were cleanshaven As Kaladin watched the front row of Parshendi knelt down They held shortbows arrows nocked Not longbows intended to launch arrows high and far Short recurve bows to fire straight and quick and strong An excellent bow to use for killing a group of bridgemen before they could lay their bridge Arriving is the worst part Now finally the real nightmare began Gaz hung back bellowing at the bridge crews to keep going Kaladins instincts screamed at him to get out of the line of fire but the momentum of the bridge forced him forward Forced him down the throat of the beast itself its teeth poised to snap closed Kaladins exhaustion and pain fled He was shocked alert The bridges charged forward the men beneath them screaming as they ran Ran toward death The archers released The first wave killed Kaladins leatheryfaced friend dropping him with three separate arrows The man to Kaladins left fell as wellKaladin hadnt even seen his face That man cried out as he dropped not dead immediately but the bridge crew trampled him The bridge got noticeably heavier as men died The Parshendi calmly drew a second volley and launched To the side Kaladin barely noticed another of the bridge crews floundering The Parshendi seemed to focus their fire on certain crews That one got a full wave of arrows from dozens of archers and the first three rows of bridgemen dropped and tripped those behind them Their bridge lurched skidding on the ground and making a sickening crunch as the mass of bodies fell over one another Arrows zipped past Kaladin killing the other two men in the front line with him Several other arrows smacked into the wood around him one slicing open the skin of his cheek He screamed In horror in shock in pain in sheer bewilderment Never before had he felt so powerless in a battle Hed charged enemy fortifications hed run beneath waves of arrows but hed always felt a measure of control Hed had his spear hed had his shield he could fight back Not this time The bridge crews were like hogs running to the slaughter A third volley flew and another of the twenty bridge crews fell Waves of arrows came from the Alethi side as well falling and striking the Parshendi Kaladins bridge was almost to the chasm He could see the black eyes of the Parshendi on the other side could make out the features of their lean marbled faces All around him bridgemen were screaming in pain arrows cutting them out from underneath their bridges There was a crashing sound as another bridge dropped its bridgemen slaughtered Behind Gaz called out Lift and down you fools The bridge crew lurched to a stop as the Parshendi launched another volley Men behind Kaladin screamed The Parshendi firing was interrupted by a return volley from the Alethi army Though he was shocked senseless Kaladins reflexes knew what do to Drop the bridge get into position to push This exposed the bridgemen who had been safe in the back ranks The Parshendi archers obviously knew this was coming they prepared and launched one final volley Arrows struck the bridge in a wave dropping a halfdozen men spraying blood across the dark wood Fearsprenwiggling and violetsprang up through the wood and wriggled in the air The bridge lurched growing much harder to push as they suddenly lost those men Kaladin stumbled hands slipping He fell to his knees and pitched out leaning over the chasm He barely managed to catch himself He teetered one hand dangling above the void the other gripping the edge His overextended mind wavered with vertigo as he stared down that sheer cliff down into darkness The height was beautiful hed always loved climbing high rock formations with Tien By reflex he shoved himself back onto the plateau scrambling backward A group of foot soldiers protected by shields had taken up positions pushing the bridge The armys archers exchanged arrows with the Parshendi as the soldiers pushed the bridge into place and heavy cavalry thundered across smashing into the Parshendi Four bridges had fallen but sixteen had been placed in a row allowing for an effective charge Kaladin tried to move tried to crawl away from the bridge But he just collapsed where he was his body refusing to obey He couldnt even roll over onto his stomach I should go he thought in exhaustion See if that leatheryfaced man is still alive Bind his wounds Save But he couldnt He couldnt move Couldnt think To his shame he just let himself close his eyes and gave himself over to unconsciousness Kaladin He didnt want to open his eyes To wake meant returning to that awful world of pain A world where defenseless exhausted men were made to charge lines of archers That world was the nightmare Kaladin The feminine voice was soft like a whisper yet still urgent Theyre going to leave you Get up Youll die I cantI cant go back Let me go Something snapped against his face a slight slap of energy with a sting to it He cringed It was nothing compared with his other pains but somehow it was far more demanding He raised a hand swatting The motion was enough to drive away the last vestiges of stupor He tried to open his eyes One refused blood from a cut on his cheek having run down and crusted around the eyelid The sun had moved Hours had passed He groanedsitting up rubbing the dried blood from his eye The ground near him was littered with bodies The air smelled of blood and worse A pair of sorry bridgemen were shaking each man in turn checking for life then pulling the vests and sandals off their bodies shooing away the cremlings feeding on the bodies The men would never have checked on Kaladin He didnt have anything for them to take Theyd have left him with the corpses stranded on the plateau Kaladins windspren flitted through the air above him moving anxiously He rubbed his jaw where shed struck him Large spren like her could move small objects and give little pinches of energy That made them all the more annoying This time it had probably saved Kaladins life He groaned at all the places where he hurt Do you have a name spirit he asked forcing himself to his battered feet On the plateau the army had crossed to soldiers were picking through the corpses of the dead Parshendi looking for something Harvesting equipment maybe It appeared that Sadeass force had won At least there didnt seem to be any Parshendi still alive Theyd either been killed or had fled The plateau theyd fought on seemed exactly like the others theyd crossed The only thing that was different here was that there was a large lump ofsomething in the center of the plateau It looked like an enormous rockbud perhaps some kind of chrysalis or shell a good twenty feet tall One side had been hacked open exposing slimy innards He hadnt noticed it on the initial charge the archers had demanded all of his attention A name the windspren said her voice distant Yes I do have a name She seemed surprised as she looked at Kaladin Why do I have a name How should I know Kaladin said forcing himself to move His feet blazed with pain He could barely limp The nearby bridgemen looked to him with surprise but he ignored them limping across the plateau until he found the corpse of a bridgeman who still had his vest and shoes It was the leatheryfaced man who had been so kind to him dead with an arrow through the neck Kaladin ignored those shocked eyes staring blankly into the sky and harvested the mans clothingleather vest leather sandals lacing shirt stained red with blood Kaladin felt disgusted with himself but he wasnt going to count on Gaz giving him clothing Kaladin sat down and used the cleaner parts of the shirt to change his improvised bandages then put on the vest and sandals trying to keep from moving too much A breeze now blew carrying away the scents of blood and the sounds of soldiers calling to one another The cavalry was already forming up as if eager to return A name the windspren said walking through the air to stand beside his face She was in the shape of a young woman complete with flowing skirt and delicate feet Sylphrena Sylphrena Kaladin repeated tying on the sandals Syl the spirit said She cocked her head Thats amusing It appears that I have a nickname Congratulations Kaladin stood up again wobbling To the side Gaz stood with hands on hips shield tied to his back You he said pointing at Kaladin He then gestured to the bridge Youve got to be kidding Kaladin said looking as the remnants of the bridge crewfewer than half of their previous number remainedgathered around the bridge Either carry or stay behind Gaz said He seemed angry about something I was supposed to die Kaladin realized Thats why he didnt care if I had a vest or sandals I was at the front Kaladin was the only one on the first row who had lived Kaladin nearly sat down and let them leave him But dying of thirst on a lonely plateau was not the way hed choose to go He stumbled over to the bridge Dont worry said one of the other bridgemen Theyll let us go slow this time take lots of breaks And well have a few soldiers to helptakes at least twentyfive men to lift a bridge Kaladin sighed getting into place as some unfortunate soldiers joined them Together they heaved the bridge into the air It was terribly heavy but they managed it somehow Kaladin walked feeling numb Hed thought that there was nothing more life could do to him nothing worse than the slaves brand with a shash nothing worse than losing all he had to the war nothing more terrible than failing those hed sworn to protect It appeared that hed been wrong There had been something more they could do to him One final torment the world had reserved just for Kaladin And it was called Bridge Four They are aflame They burn They bring the darkness when they come and so all you can see is that their skin is aflame Burn burn burn Collected on Palahishev 1172 21 seconds predeath Subject was a bakers apprentice Shallan hurried down the hallway with its burntorange colorings the ceiling and upper walls now stained by the passing of black smoke from Jasnahs Soulcasting Hopefully the paintings on the walls hadnt been ruined Ahead a small group of parshmen arrived bearing rags buckets and stepladders to use in wiping off the soot They bowed to her as she passed uttering no words Parshmen could speak but they rarely did so Many seemed mute As a child shed found the patterns of their marbled skin beautiful That had been before her father forbade her to spend any time with the parshmen She turned her mind to her task How was she going to convince Jasnah Kholin one of the most powerful women in the world to change her mind about taking Shallan as a ward The woman was obviously stubborn she had spent years resisting the devotaries attempts at reconciliation She reentered the broad main cavern with its lofty stone ceiling and bustling welldressed occupants She felt daunted but that brief glimpse of the Soulcaster seduced her Her family House Davar had prospered in recent years coming out of obscurity This had primarily been because of her fathers skill in politicshe had been hated by many but his ruthlessness had carried him far So had the wealth lent by the discovery of several important new marble deposits on Davar lands Shallan had never known enough to be suspicious of that wealths origins Every time the family had exhausted one of its quarries her father had gone out with his surveyor and discovered a new one Only after interrogating the surveyor had Shallan and her brothers discovered the truth Her father using his forbidden Soulcaster had been creating new deposits at a careful rate Not enough to be suspicious Just enough to give him the money he needed to further his political goals Nobody knew where hed gotten the fabrial which she now carried in her safepouch It was unusable damaged on the same disastrous evening that her father had died Dont think about that she told herself forcefully Theyd had a jeweler repair the broken Soulcaster but it no longer worked Their house stewardone of her fathers close confidants an advisor named Lueshhad been trained to use the device and he could no longer make it function Her fathers debts and promises were outrageous Their choices were limited Her family had some timeperhaps as long as a yearbefore the missed payments became egregious and before her fathers absence became obvious For once her familys isolated backcountry estates were an advantage providing a reason that communications were being delayed Her brothers were scrambling writing letters in her fathers name making a few appearances and spreading rumors that Brightlord Davar was planning something big All to give her time to make good on her bold plan Find Jasnah Kholin Become her ward Learn where she kept her Soulcaster Then replace it with the nonfunctional one With the fabrial theyd be able to make new quarries and restore their wealth Theyd be able to make food to feed their house soldiers With enough wealth in hand to pay off debts and make bribes they could announce their fathers death and not suffer destruction Shallan hesitated in the main hallway considering her next move What she planned to do was very risky Shed have to escape without implicating herself in the theft Though shed devoted much thought to that she still didnt know how shed manage it But Jasnah was known to have many enemies There had to be a way to pin the fabrials breaking on them instead That step would come later For now Shallan had to convince Jasnah to accept her as a ward All other results were unacceptable Nervously Shallan held her arms in the sign of need covered safehand bent across her chest and touching the elbow of her freehand which was raised with fingers outspread A woman approached wearing the wellstarched white laced shirt and black skirt that were the universal sign of a masterservant The stout woman curtsied Brightness The Palanaeum Shallan said The woman bowed and led Shallan farther into the depths of the long hallway Most of the women hereservants includedwore their hair bound and Shallan felt conspicuous with hers loose The deep red color made her stand out even more Soon the grand hallway began to slope down steeply But when the halfhour arrived she could still hear distant bells ring behind her Perhaps that was why the people here liked them so much even in the depths of the Conclave one could hear the outside world The servant led Shallan to a pair of grand steel doors The servant bowed and Shallan dismissed her with a nod Shallan couldnt help but admire the beauty of the doors their exterior was carved in an intricate geometric pattern with circles and lines and glyphs It was some kind of chart half on each door There was no time to study the details unfortunately and she passed them by Beyond the doors was a breathtakingly large room The sides were of smooth rock and they stretched high the dim illumination made it impossible to tell just how high but she saw flickers of distant light Set into the walls were dozens of small balconies much like the private box seats of a theater Soft light shone from many of these The only sounds were turning pages and faint whispers Shallan raised her safehand to her breast feeling dwarfed by the magnificent chamber Brightness a young male masterservant said approaching What do you need A new sense of perspective apparently Shallan said absently How This room is called the Veil the servant explained softly That which comes before the Palanaeum itself Both were here when the city was founded Some think these chambers might have been cut by the Dawnsingers themselves Where are the books The Palanaeum proper is this way The servant gestured leading her to a set of doors on the other side of the room Through them she entered a smaller chamber that was partitioned with walls of thick crystal Shallan approached the nearest one feeling it The crystals surface was rough like hewn rock Soulcast she asked The servant nodded Behind him another servant passed leading an elderly ardent Like most ardents the aged man had a shaved head and a long beard His simple grey robes were tied with a brown sash The servant led him around a corner and Shallan could vaguely make out their shapes on the other side shadows swimming through the crystal She took a step forward but her servant cleared his throat I will need your chit of admittance Brightness How much does one cost Shallan asked hesitantly A thousand sapphire broams So much The kings many hospitals require much upkeep the man said apologetically The only things Kharbranth has to sell are fish bells and information The first two are hardly unique to us But the thirdwell the Palanaeum has the finest collection of tomes and scrolls on Roshar More even than the Holy Enclave in Valath At last count there were over seven hundred thousand separate texts in our archive Her father had owned exactly eightyseven books Shallan had read them all several times over How much could be contained in seven hundred thousand books The weight of that much information dazzled her She found herself hungering to look through those hidden shelves She could spend months just reading their titles But no Perhaps once shed made certain her brothers were safeonce her houses finances were restoredshe could return Perhaps She felt like she was starving yet leaving a warm fruit pie uneaten Where might I wait she asked If someone I know is inside You may use one of the reading alcoves the servant said relaxing Perhaps hed feared that she would make a scene No chit is required to sit in one There are parshman porters who will raise you to the higher levels if that is what you wish Thank you Shallan said turning her back on the Palanaeum She felt like a child again locked in her room not allowed to run through the gardens because of her fathers paranoid fears Does Brightness Jasnah have an alcove yet I can ask the servant said leading the way back into the Veil with its distant unseen ceiling He hurried off to speak with some others leaving Shallan standing beside the doorway to the Palanaeum She could run in Sneak through No Her brothers teased her for being too timid but it was not timidity that held her back There would undoubtedly be guards bursting in would not only be futile it would ruin any chance she had of changing Jasnahs mind Change Jasnahs mind prove herself Considering it made her sick She hated confrontation During her youth shed felt like a piece of delicate crystalware locked in a cabinet to be displayed but never touched The only daughter the last memory of Brightlord Davars beloved wife It still felt odd to her that she been the one to take charge afterAfter the incidentAfter Memories attacked her Nan Balat bruised his coat torn A long silvery sword in her hand sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water No Shallan thought her back to the stone wall clutching her satchel No Dont think of the past She sought solace in drawing raising fingers to her satchel and reaching for her paper and pencils The servant came back before she had a chance to get them out however Brightness Jasnah Kholin has indeed asked that a reading alcove be set aside for her he said You may wait there for her if you wish it I do Shallan said Thank you The servant led her to a shadowed enclosure inside of which four parshmen stood upon a sturdy wooden platform The servant and Shallan stepped onto the platform and the parshmen pulled ropes that were strung into a pulley above raising the platform up the stone shaft The only lights were broam spheres set at each corner of the lifts ceiling Amethysts which had a soft violet light She needed a plan Jasnah Kholin did not seem the type to change her mind easily Shallan would have to surprise her impress her They reached a level about forty feet or so off the ground and the servant waved for the porters to stop Shallan followed the masterservant down a dark hallway to one of the small balconies that extended out over the Veil It was round like a turret and had a waisthigh stone rim with a wooden railing above that Other occupied alcoves glowed with different colors from the spheres being used to light them the darkness of the huge space made them seem to hover in the air This alcove had a long curving stone desk joined directly into the rim of the balcony There was a single chair and a gobletlike crystal bowl Shallan nodded in thanks to the servant who withdrew then she pulled out a handful of spheres and dropped them into the bowl lighting the alcove She sighed sitting down in the chair and laying her satchel on the desk She undid the laces on her satchel busying herself as she tried to think of somethinganythingthat would persuade Jasnah First she decided I need to clear my mind From her satchel she removed a sheaf of thick drawing paper a set of charcoal pencils of different widths some brushes and steel pens ink and watercolors Finally she took out her smaller notebook bound in codex form which contained the nature sketches shed done during her weeks aboard the Winds pleasure These were simple things really but worth more to her than a chest full of spheres She took a sheet off the stack then selected a finepointed charcoal pencil rolling it between her fingers She closed her eyes and fixed an image in her mind Kharbranth as shed memorized it in that moment soon after landing on the docks Waves surging against the wooden posts a salty scent to the air men climbing rigging calling one another with excitement And the city itself rising up the hillside homes stacked atop homes not a speck of land wasted Bells distant tinkling softly in the air She opened her eyes and began to draw Her fingers moved on their own sketching broad lines first The cracklike valley the city was situated in The port Here squares to be homes there a slash to mark a switchback of the grand roadway that led up to the Conclave Slowly bit by bit she added detail Shadows as windows Lines to fill out the roadways Hints of people and carts to show the chaos of the thoroughfares She had read of how sculptors worked Many would take a blank stone block and work it into a vague shape first Then theyd work it over again carving more detail with each pass It was the same for her in drawing Broad lines first then some details then more then down to the finest of lines She had no formal training in pencils she simply did what felt right The city took shape beneath her fingers She coaxed it free line by line scratch by scratch What would she do without this Tension bled from her body as if released from her fingertips into the pencil She lost track of time as she worked Sometimes she felt like she was entering a trance everything else fading Her fingers almost seemed to draw of their own accord It was so much easier to think while drawing Before too long she had copied her Memory onto the page She held up the sheet satisfied relaxed her mind clear The memorized image of Kharbranth was gone from her head shed released it into her sketch There was a sense of relaxation to that too As if her mind was put under tension holding Memories until they could be used She did Yalb next standing shirtless in his vest and gesturing to the short porter who had pulled her up to the Conclave She smiled as she worked remembering Yalbs affable voice Hed likely returned to the Winds Pleasure by now Had it been two hours Probably She was always more excited by drawing animals and people than she was by drawing things There was something energizing about putting a living creature onto the page A city was lines and boxes but a person was circles and curves Could she get that smirk on Yalbs face right Could she show his lazy contentedness the way he would flirt with a woman far above his station And the porter with his thin fingers and sandaled feet his long coat and baggy pants His strange language his keen eyes his plan to increase his tip by offering not just a ride but a tour When she drew she didnt feel as if she worked with only charcoal and paper In drawing a portrait her medium was the soul itself There were plants from which one could remove a tiny cuttinga leaf or a bit of stemthen plant it and grow a duplicate When she collected a Memory of a person she was snipping free a bud of their soul and she cultivated and grew it on the page Charcoal for sinew paper pulp for bone ink for blood the papers texture for skin She fell into a rhythm a cadence the scratching of her pencil like the sound of breathing from those she depicted Creationspren began to gather around her pad looking at her work Like other spren they were said to always be around but usually invisible Sometimes you attracted them Sometimes you didnt With drawing skill seemed to make a difference Creationspren were of medium size as tall as one of her fingers and they glowed with a faint silvery light They transformed perpetually taking new shapes Usually the shapes were things they had seen recently An urn a person a table a wheel a nail Always of the same silvery color always the same diminutive height They imitated shapes exactly but moved them in strange ways A table would roll like a wheel an urn would shatter and repair itself Her drawing gathered about a halfdozen of them pulling them by her act of creation just as a bright fire would draw flamespren Shed learned to ignore them They werent substantialif she moved her arm through one its figure would smear like scattered sand then reform She never felt a thing when touching one Eventually she held up the page satisfied It depicted Yalb and the porter in detail with hints of the busy city behind Shed gotten their eyes right That was the most important Each of the Ten Essences had an analogous part of the human bodyblood for liquid hair for wood and so forth The eyes were associated with crystal and glass The windows into a persons mind and spirit She set the page aside Some men collected trophies Others collected weapons or shields Many collected spheres Shallan collected people People and interesting creatures Perhaps it was because shed spent so much of her youth in a virtual prison Shed developed the habit of memorizing faces then drawing them later after her father had discovered her sketching the gardeners His daughter Drawing pictures of darkeyes Hed been furious with herone of the infrequent times hed directed his infamous temper at his daughter After that shed done drawings of people only when in private instead using her open drawing times to sketch the insects crustaceans and plants of the manor gardens Her father hadnt minded thiszoology and botany were proper feminine pursuitsand had encouraged her to choose natural history as her Calling She took out a third blank sheet It seemed to beg her to fill it A blank page was nothing but potential pointless until it was used Like a fully infused sphere cloistered inside a pouch prevented from making its light useful Fill me The creationspren gathered around the page They were still as if curious anticipatory Shallan closed her eyes and imagined Jasnah Kholin standing before the blocked door the Soulcaster glowing on her hand The hallway hushed save for a childs sniffles Attendants holding their breath An anxious king A still reverence Shallan opened her eyes and began to draw with vigor intentionally losing herself The less she was in the now and the more she was in the then the better the sketch would be The other two pictures had been warmups this was the days masterpiece With the paper bound onto the boardsafehand holding thather freehand flew across the page occasionally switching to other pencils Soft charcoal for deep thick blackness like Jasnahs beautiful hair Hard charcoal for light greys like the powerful waves of light coming from the Soulcasters gems For a few extended moments Shallan was back in that hallway again watching something that should not be a heretic wielding one of the most sacred powers in all the world The power of change itself the power by which the Almighty had created Roshar He had another name allowed to pass only the lips of ardents Elithanathile He Who Transforms Shallan could smell the musty hallway She could hear the child whimpering She could feel her own heart beating in anticipation The boulder would soon change Sucking away the Stormlight in Jasnahs gemstone it would give up its essence becoming something new Shallans breath caught in her throat And then the memory faded returning her to the quiet dim alcove The page now held a perfect rendition of the scene worked in blacks and greys The princesss proud figure regarded the fallen stone demanding that it give way before her will It was her Shallan knew with the intuitive certainty of an artist that this was one of the finest pieces she had ever done In a very small way she had captured Jasnah Kholin something the devotaries had never managed That gave her a euphoric thrill Even if this woman rejected Shallan again one fact would not change Jasnah Kholin had joined Shallans collection Shallan wiped her fingers on her cleaning cloth then lifted the paper She noted absently that shed attracted some two dozen creationspren now She would have to lacquer the page with plytree sap to set the charcoal and protect it from smudges She had some in her satchel First she wanted to study the page and the figure it contained Who was Jasnah Kholin Not one to be cowed certainly She was a woman to the bone master of the feminine arts but not by any means delicate Such a woman would appreciate Shallans determination She would listen to another request for wardship assuming it was presented properly Jasnah was also a rationalist a woman with the audacity to deny the existence of the Almighty himself based on her own reasoning Jasnah would appreciate strength but only if it was shaped by logic Shallan nodded to herself taking out a fourth sheet of paper and a finetipped brushpen then shaking and opening her jar of ink Jasnah had demanded proof of Shallans logical and writing skills Well what better way to do that than to supplicate the woman with words Brightness Jasnah Kholin Shallan wrote painting the letters as neatly and beautifully as she could She could have used a reed instead but a brushpen was for works of art She intended this page to be just that You have rejected my petition I accept that Yet as anyone trained in formal inquiry knows no supposition should be treated as axiomatic The actual argument usually read no suppositionsave for the existence of the Almighty himselfshould be held as axiomatic But this wording would appeal to Jasnah A scientist must be willing to change her theories if experiment disproves them I hold to the hope that you treat decisions in a like manner as preliminary results pending further information From our brief interaction I can see that you appreciate tenacity You complimented me on continuing to seek you out Therefore I presume that you will not find this letter a breach of good taste Take it as proof of my ardor to be your ward and not as disdain for your expressed decision Shallan raised the end of her brushpen to her lips as she considered her next step The creationspren slowly faded away vanishing There were said to be logicsprenin the form of tiny stormcloudswho were attracted to great arguments but Shallan had never seen them You expect proof of my worthiness Shallan continued I wish I could demonstrate that my schooling is more complete than our interview revealed Unfortunately I havent the grounds for such an argument I have weaknesses in my understanding That is plain and not subject to reasonable dispute But the lives of men and women are more than logical puzzles the context of their experiences is invaluable in making good decisions My study in logic does not rise to your standards but even I know that the rationalists have a rule One can not apply logic as an absolute where human beings are concerned We are not beings of thought only Therefore the soul of my argument here is to give perspective on my ignorance Not by way of excuse but of explanation You expressed displeasure that one such as I should be trained so inadequately What of my stepmother What of my tutors Why was my education handled so poorly The facts are embarrassing I have had few tutors and virtually no education My stepmother tried but she had no education herself It is a carefully guarded secret but many of the rural Veden houses ignore the proper training of their women I had three different tutors when I was very young but each left after a few months citing my fathers temper or rudeness as her reason I was left to my own devices in education I have learned what I could through reading filling in the gaps by taking advantage of my own curious nature But I will not be capable of matching knowledge with someone who has been given the benefit of a formaland expensiveeducation Why is this an argument that you should accept me Because everything I have learned has come by way of great personal struggle What others were handed I had to hunt I believe that because of this my educationlimited though it ishas extra worth and merit I respect your decisions but I do ask you to reconsider Which would you rather have A ward who is able to repeat the correct answers because an overpriced tutor drilled them into her or a ward who had to struggle and fight for everything she has learned I assure you that one of those two will prize your teachings far more than the other She raised her brush Her arguments seemed imperfect now that she considered them She exposed her ignorance then expected Jasnah to welcome her Still it seemed the right thing to do for all the fact that this letter was a lie A lie built of truths She hadnt truly come to partake of Jasnahs knowledge She had come as a thief That made her conscience itch and she nearly reached out and crumpled the page Steps in the hallway outside made her freeze She leaped to her feet spinning safehand held to her breast She fumbled for words to explain her presence to Jasnah Kholin Light and shadows flickered in the hallway then a figure hesitantly looked into the alcove a single white sphere cupped in one hand for light It was not Jasnah It was a man in his early twenties wearing simple grey robes An ardent Shallan relaxed The young man noticed her His face was narrow his blue eyes keen His beard was trimmed short and square his head shaved When he spoke his voice had a cultured tone Ah excuse me Brightness I thought this was the alcove of Jasnah Kholin It is Shallan said Oh Youre waiting for her too Yes Would you mind terribly if I waited with you He had a faint Herdazian accent Of course not Ardent She nodded her head in respect then gathered up her things in haste preparing the seat for him I cant take your seat Brightness Ill fetch another for myself She raised a hand in protest but he had already retreated He returned a few moments later carrying a chair from another alcove He was tall and lean andshe decided with slight discomfortrather handsome Her father had owned only three ardents all elderly men They had traveled his lands and visited the villages ministering to the people helping them reach Points in their Glories and Callings She had their faces in her collection of portraits The ardent set down his chair He hesitated before sitting glancing at the table My my he said in surprise For a moment Shallan thought he was reading her letter and she felt an irrational surge of panic The ardent however was regarding the three drawings that lay at the head of the table awaiting lacquer You did these Brightness he said Yes Ardent Shallan said lowering her eyes No need to be so formal the ardent said leaning down and adjusting his spectacles as he studied her work Please I am Brother Kabsal or just Kabsal Really its fine And you are Shallan Davar By Vedeledevs golden keys Brightness Brother Kabsal said seating himself Did Jasnah Kholin teach you this skill with the pencil No Ardent she said still standing Still so formal he said smiling at her Tell me am I so intimidating as that I have been brought up to show respect to ardents Well I myself find that respect is like manure Use it where needed and growth will flourish Spread it on too thick and things just start to smell His eyes twinkled Had an ardenta servant of the Almightyjust spoken of manure An ardent is a representative of the Almighty himself she said To show you lack of respect would be to show it to the Almighty I see And this is how youd respond if the Almighty himself appeared to you here All of this formality and bowing She hesitated Well no Ah and how would you react I suspect with screams of pain she said letting her thought slip out too easily As it is written that the Almightys glory is such that any who look upon him would immediately be burned to ash The ardent laughed at that Wisely spoken indeed Please do sit though She did so hesitant You still appear conflicted he said holding up her portrait of Jasnah What must I do to put you at ease Shall I step up onto this desk here and do a jig She blinked in surprise No objection Brother Kabsal said Well then He set down the portrait and began to climb up on his chair No please Shallan said holding out her freehand Are you certain he glanced at the desk appraisingly Yes Shallan said imagining the ardent teetering and making a misstep then falling off the balcony and plunging dozens of feet to the ground below Please I promise not to respect you any longer He chuckled hopping down and seating himself He leaned closer to her as if conspiratorially The table jig threat almost always works Ive only ever had to go through with it once due to a lost bet against Brother Lhanin The master ardent of our monastery nearly keeled over in shock Shallan found herself smiling Youre an ardent youre forbidden to have possessions What did you bet Two deep breaths of a winter roses fragrance said Brother Kabsal and the sunlights warmth on your skin He smiled We can be rather creative at times Years spent marinating in a monastery can do that to a man Now you were about to explain to me where you learned such skill with a pencil Practice Shallan said I should suspect that is how everyone learns eventually Wise words again I am beginning to wonder which of us it the ardent But surely you had a master to teach you Dandos the Oilsworn Ah a true master of pencils if there ever was one Now not that I doubt your word Brightness but Im rather intrigued how Dandos Heraldin could have trained you in arts aslast I checkedhes suffering a rather terminal and perpetual ailment Namely that of being dead For three hundred years Shallan blushed My father had a book of his instruction You learned this Kabsal said lifting up her drawing of Jasnah from a book Eryes He looked back at the picture I need to read more Shallan found herself laughing at the ardents expression and she took a Memory of him sitting there admiration and perplexity blending on his face as he studied the picture rubbing his bearded chin with one finger He smiled pleasantly setting down the picture You have lacquer I do she said getting it out of her satchel It was contained in a bulb sprayer of the type often used for perfume He accepted the small jar and twisted the clasp on the front then gave the bottle a shake and tested the lacquer on the back of his hand He nodded in satisfaction and reached for the drawing A piece such as this should not be allowed to risk smudging I can lacquer it Shallan said No need to trouble yourself It is no trouble its an honor Besides I am an ardent We dont know what to do with ourselves when we arent busying about doing things others could do for themselves It is best just to humor me He began to apply the lacquer dusting the page with careful puffs She had trouble keeping herself from reaching to snatch the sketch away Fortunately his hands were careful and the lacquer went on evenly Hed obviously done this before You are from Jah Keved I presume he asked From the hair she asked raising a hand to her red locks Or from the accent From the way you treat ardents The Veden Church is by far the most traditional I have visited your lovely country on two occasions while your food sits well in my stomach the amount of bowing and scraping you show ardents made me uncomfortable Perhaps you should have danced on a few tables I considered it he said but my brother and sister ardents from your country would likely have dropped dead of embarrassment I would hate to have that on my conscience The Almighty is not kind toward those who kill his priests I should think that killing in general would be frowned upon she responded still watching him apply the lacquer It felt odd to let someone else work on her art What does Brightness Jasnah think of your skill he asked as he worked I dont think she cares Shallan said grimacing and remembering her conversation with the woman She doesnt seem terribly appreciative of the visual arts So I have heard Its one of her few faults unfortunately Another being that little matter of her heresy Indeed Kabsal said smiling I must admit I stepped in here expecting indifference not deference How did you come to be part of her entourage Shallan started realizing for the first time that Brother Kabsal must have assumed her to be one of the Brightlady Kholins attendants Perhaps a ward Bother she said to herself Hum It appears Ive inadvertently misled you Brother Kabsal Im not associated with Brightness Jasnah Not yet anyway Ive been trying to get her to take me on as a ward Ah he said finishing his lacquering Im sorry For what You did nothing wrong He blew on the picture then turned it for her to see It was perfectly lacquered without any smears If you would do me a favor child he said setting the page aside Anything He raised an eyebrow at that Anything reasonable she corrected By whose reason Mine I guess Pity he said standing Then I will limit myself If you would kindly let Brightness Jasnah know that I called upon her She knows you What business had a Herdazian ardent with Jasnah a confirmed atheist Oh I wouldnt say that he replied Id hope shes heard my name though since Ive requested an audience with her several times Shallan nodded rising You want to try to convert her I presume She presents a unique challenge I dont think I could live with myself if I didnt at least try to persuade her And we wouldnt want you to be unable to live with yourself Shallan noted as the alternative harks back to your nasty habit of almost killing ardents Exactly Anyway I think a personal message from you might help where written requests have been ignored Idoubt that Well if she refuses it only means that Ill be back He smiled That would meanhopefullythat we shall meet each other again So I look forward to it I as well And Im sorry again about the misunderstanding Brightness Please Dont take responsibility for my assumptions She smiled I should hesitate to take responsibility for you in any manner or regard Brother Kabsal But I still feel bad It will pass he noted blue eyes twinkling But Ill do my best to make you feel well again Is there anything youre fond of Other than respecting ardents and drawing amazing pictures that is Jam He cocked his head I like it she said shrugging You asked what I was fond of Jam So it shall be He withdrew into the dark corridor fishing in his robe pocket for his sphere to give him light In moments he was gone Why didnt he wait for Jasnah to return himself Shallan shook her head then lacquered her other two pictures She had just finished letting them drypacking them in her satchelwhen she heard footsteps in the hallway again and recognized Jasnahs voice speaking Shallan hurriedly gathered her things leaving the letter on the desk then stepped up to the side of the alcove to wait Jasnah Kholin entered a moment later accompanied by a small group of servants She did not look pleased Victory We stand atop the mount We scatter them before us Their homes become our dens their lands are now our farms And they shall burn as we once did in a place that is hollow and forlorn Collected on Ishashan 1172 18 seconds predeath Subject was a lighteyed spinster of the eighth dahn Shallans fears were confirmed as Jasnah looked straight at her then lowered her safehand to her side in a mark of frustration So you are here Shallan cringed The servants told you then You didnt think that they would leave someone in my alcove and not warn me Behind Jasnah a small group of parshmen hesitated in the hallway each carrying an armload of books Brightness Kholin Shallan said I just I have wasted enough time on you already Jasnah said eyes furious You will withdraw Miss Davar And I will not see you again during my time here Am I understood Shallans hopes crumbled She shrank back There was a gravity to Jasnah Kholin One did not disobey her One need only look into those eyes to understand Im sorry to have bothered you Shallan whispered clutching her satchel and leaving with as much dignity as she could manage She barely kept the tears of embarrassment and disappointment from her eyes as she hastened down the hallway feeling like a complete fool She reached the porters shaft though they had already returned below after bringing up Jasnah Shallan didnt pull the bell to summon them Instead she placed her back to the wall and sank down to the floor knees up against her chest satchel in her lap She wrapped her arms around her legs freehand clasping her safehand through the fabric of her cuff breathing quietly Angry people unsettled her She couldnt help but think of her father in one of his tirades couldnt help but hear screams bellows and whimpers Was she weak because confrontation unsettled her so She felt that she was Foolish idiot girl she thought a few painspren crawling out of the wall near her head What made you think you could do this Youve only set foot off your family grounds a halfdozen times during your life Idiot idiot idiot She had persuaded her brothers to trust her to put hope in her ridiculous plan And now what had she done Wasted six months during which their enemies circled closer Brightness Davar asked a hesitant voice Shallan looked up realizing shed been so wrapped in her misery that she hadnt seen the servant approach He was a younger man wearing an all black uniform no emblem on the breast Not a masterservant but perhaps one in training Brightness Kholin would like to speak with you The young man gestured back down the hallway To berate me further Shallan thought with a grimace But a highlady like Jasnah got what she wanted Shallan forced herself to stop shaking then stood At least shed been able to keep the tears away she hadnt ruined her makeup She followed the servant back to the lit alcove satchel clutched before her like a shield on the battlefield Jasnah Kholin sat in the chair Shallan had been using stacks of books on the table Jasnah was rubbing her forehead with her freehand The Soulcaster rested against the back of her skin the smokestone dark and cracked Though Jasnah looked fatigued she sat with perfect posture her fine silk dress covering her feet her safehand held across her lap Jasnah focused on Shallan lowering her freehand I should not have treated you with such anger Miss Davar she said in a tired voice You were simply showing persistence a trait I normally encourage Storms alight Ive oft been guilty of stubbornness myself Sometimes we find it hardest to accept in others that which we cling to in ourselves My only excuse can be that I have put myself under an unusual amount of strain lately Shallan nodded in gratitude though she felt terribly awkward Jasnah turned to look out of the balcony into the dark space of the Veil I know what people say of me I should hope that I am not as harsh as some say though a woman could have far worse than a reputation for sternness It can serve one well Shallan had to forcibly keep herself from fidgeting Should she withdraw Jasnah shook her head to herself though Shallan could not guess what thoughts had caused the unconscious gesture Finally she turned back to Shallan and waved toward the large gobletlike bowl on the desk It held a dozen of Shallans spheres Shallan raised her freehand to her lips in shock Shed completely forgotten the money She bowed to Jasnah in thanks then hurriedly collected the spheres Brightness lest I forget I should mention that an ardentBrother Kabsalcame to see you while I waited here He wished me to pass on his desire to speak with you Not surprising Jasnah said You seem surprised about the spheres Miss Davar I assumed that you were waiting outside to recover them Is that not why you were so close No Brightness I was just settling my nerves Ah Shallan bit her lip The princess appeared to have gotten past her initial tirade PerhapsBrightness Shallan said cringing at her brashness what did you think of my letter Letter I Shallan glanced at the desk Beneath that stack of books Brightness A servant quickly moved aside the stack of books the parshman must have set it on the paper without noticing Jasnah picked up the letter raising an eyebrow and Shallan hurriedly undid her satchel and placed the spheres in her money pouch Then she cursed herself for being so quick as now she had nothing to do but stand and wait for Jasnah to finish reading This is true Jasnah looking up from the paper You are selftrained Yes Brightness That is remarkable Thank you Brightness And this letter was a clever maneuver You correctly assumed that I would respond to a written plea This shows me your skill with words and the rhetoric of the letter gives proof that you can think logically and make a good argument Thank you Brightness Shallan said feeling another surge of hope mixed with fatigue Her emotions had been jerked back and forth like a rope being used for a tugging contest You should have left the note for me and withdrawn before I returned But then the note would have been lost beneath that stack of books Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her as if to show that she did not appreciate being corrected Very well The context of a persons life is important Your circumstances do not excuse your lack of education in history and philosophy but leniency is in order I will allow you to petition me again at a later date a privilege I have never given any aspiring ward Once you have a sufficient groundwork in those two subjects come to me again If you have improved suitably I will accept you Shallans emotions sank Jasnahs offer was kindly but it would take years of study to accomplish what she asked House Davar would have fallen by then her familys lands divided among its creditors her brothers and herself stripped of title and perhaps enslaved Thank you Brightness Shallan said bowing her head Jasnah nodded as if considering the matter closed Shallan withdrew walking quietly down the hallway and pulling the cord to ring for the porters Jasnah had all but promised to accept her at a later date For most that would be a great victory Being trained by Jasnah Kholinthought by some to be the finest living scholarwould have ensured a bright future Shallan would have married extremely well likely to the son of a highprince and would have found new social circles open to her Indeed if Shallan had possessed the time to train under Jasnah the sheer prestige of a Kholin affiliation might have been enough to save her house If only Eventually Shallan made her way out of the Conclave there were no gates on the front just pillars set before the open maw She was surprised to discover how dim it was outside She trailed down the large steps then took a smaller more cultivated side path where she would be out of the way Small shelves of ornamental shalebark had been grown along this walkway and several species had let out fanlike tendrils to wave in the evening breeze A few lazy lifesprenlike specks of glowing green dustflitted from one frond to the next Shallan leaned back against the stonelike plant the tendrils pulling in and hiding From this vantage she could look down at Kharbranth lights glowing beneath her like a cascade of fire streaming down the cliff face The only other option for her and her brothers was to run To abandon the family estates in Jah Keved and seek asylum But where Were there old allies her father hadnt alienated There was that matter of the strange collection of maps theyd found in his study What did they mean Hed rarely spoken of his plans to his children Even her fathers advisors knew very little Helaranher eldest brotherhad known more but he had vanished over a year ago and her father had proclaimed him dead As always thinking of her father made her feel ill and the pain started to constrict her chest She raised her freehand to her head suddenly overwhelmed by the weight of House Davars situation her part in it and the secret she now carried hidden ten heartbeats away Ho young miss a voice called She turned shocked to see Yalb standing up on a rocky shelf a short distance from the Conclave entrance A group of men in guard uniforms sat on the rock around him Yalb she said aghast He should have returned to his ship hours ago She hurried over to stand below the short stone outcropping Why are you still here Oh he said grinning I found myself a game of kabers here with these fine upstanding gentlemen of the city guard Figured officers of the law were right unlikely to cheat me so we entered into a friendlytype game while I waited But you didnt need to wait Didnt need to win eighty chips off these fellows neither Yalb said with a laugh But I did both The men sitting around him looked far less enthusiastic Their uniforms were orange tabards tied about the middle with white sashes Well I suppose I should be leading you back to the ship then Yalb said reluctantly gathering up the spheres in the pile at his feet They glowed with a variety of hues Their light was smalleach was only a chipbut it was impressive winnings Shallan stepped back as Yalb hopped off the rock shelf His companions protested his departure but he gestured to Shallan Youd have me leave a lighteyed woman of her stature to walk back to the ship on her own I figured you for men of honor That quieted their protests Yalb chuckled to himself bowing to Shallan and leading her away down the path He had a twinkle to his eyes Stormfather but its fun to win against lawmen Ill have free drinks at the docks once this gets around You shouldnt gamble Shallan said You shouldnt try to guess the future I didnt give you that sphere so you could waste it on such practices Yalb laughed It aint gambling if you know youre going to win young miss You cheated she hissed horrified She glanced back at the guardsmen who had settled down to continue their game lit by the spheres on the stones before them Not so loud Yalb said in a low voice However he seemed very pleased with himself Cheating four guardsmen now thats a trick Hardly believe I managed it Im disappointed in you This is not proper behavior It is if youre a sailor young miss He shrugged Its what they right expected from me Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels they did The game wasnt about the cardsit was about them trying to figure how I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling me off I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you hadnt arrived That didnt seem to worry him much The roadway down to the docks was not nearly as busy as it had been earlier but there were still a surprisingly large number of people about The street was lit by oil lanternsspheres would just have ended up in someones pouchbut many of the people about carried sphere lanterns casting a rainbow of colored light on the roadway The people were almost like spren each a different hue moving this way or that So young miss Yalb said leading her carefully through the traffic You really want to go back I just said what I did so I could extract myself from that game there Yes I do want to go back please And your princess Shallan grimaced The meeting wasunproductive She didnt take you Whats wrong with her Chronic competence I should guess Shes been so successful in life that she has unrealistic expectations of others Yalb frowned guiding Shallan around a group of revelers stumbling drunkenly up the roadway Wasnt it a little early for that sort of thing Yalb got a few steps ahead turning and walking backward looking at her That doesnt make sense young miss What more could she want than you Much more apparently But youre perfect Pardon my forwardness Youre walking backward Pardon my backwardness then You look good from any side young miss that you do She found herself smiling Tozbeks sailors had far too high an opinion of her Youd make an ideal ward he continued Genteel pretty refined and such Dont much like your opinion on gambling but thats to be expected Wouldnt be right for a proper woman not to scold a fellow for gambling Itd be like the sun refusing to rise or the sea turning white Or Jasnah Kholin smiling Exactly Anyway youre perfect Its kind of you to say so Well its true he said putting hands on hips stopping So thats it Youre going to give up She gave him a perplexed stare He stood there on the busy roadway lit from above by a lantern burning yelloworange hands on his hips white Thaylen eyebrows drooping along the sides of his face barechested under his open vest That was a posture no citizen no matter how high ranked had ever taken at her fathers mansion I did try to persuade her Shallan said blushing I went to her a second time and she rejected me again Two times eh In cards you always got to try a third hand It wins the most often Shallan frowned But thats not really true The laws of probability and statistics Dont know much blustering math Yalb said folding his arms But I do know the Passions You win when you need it most you see The Passions Pagan superstition Of course Jasnah had referred to glyphwards as superstition too so perhaps it all came down to perspective Try a third timeShallan shivered to consider Jasnahs wrath if Shallan bothered her yet again Shed surely withdraw the offer to come study with her in the future But Shallan would never get to take that offer It was like a glass sphere with no gemstone at the center Pretty but worthless Was it not better to take one last chance at getting the position she needed now It wouldnt work Jasnah had made it quite clear that Shallan was not yet educated enough Not yet educated enough An idea sparked in Shallans head She raised her safehand to her breast standing on that roadway considering the audacity of it Shed likely get herself thrown from the city at Jasnahs demand Yet if she returned home without trying every avenue could she face her brothers They depended on her For once in her life someone needed Shallan That responsibility excited her And terrified her I need a book merchant she found herself saying voice wavering slightly Yalb raised an eyebrow at her Third hand wins the most Do you think you can find me a book merchant who is open at this hour Kharbranth is a major port young miss he said with a laugh Stores stay open late Just wait here He dashed off into the evening crowd leaving her with an anxious protest on her lips She sighed then seated herself in a demure posture on the stone base of a lantern pole It should be safe She saw other lighteyed women passing on the street though they were often carried in palanquins or those small handpulled vehicles She even saw the occasional real carriage though only the very wealthy could afford to keep horses A few minutes later Yalb popped out of the crowd as if from nowhere and waved for her to follow She rose and hurried to him Should we get a porter she asked as he led her to a large side street that ran laterally across the citys hill She stepped carefully her skirt was long enough that she worried about tearing the hem on the stone The strip at the bottom was designed to be easily replaced but Shallan could hardly afford to waste spheres on such things Nah Yalb said Its right here He pointed along another cross street This one had a row of shops climbing up the steep slope each with a sign hanging out front bearing the glyphpair for book and those glyphs were often styled into the shape of a book Illiterate servants who might be sent to a shop had to be able to recognize them Merchants of the same type like to clump together Yalb said rubbing his chin Seems dumb to me but I guess merchants are like fish Where you find one youll find others The same could be said of ideas Shallan said counting Six different shops All were lit with Stormlight in the windows cool and even Third one on the left Yalb said pointing Merchants name is Artmyrn My sources say hes the best It was a Thaylen name Likely Yalb had asked others from his homeland and they had pointed him here She nodded to Yalb and they climbed up the steep stone street to the shop Yalb didnt enter with her shed noticed that many men were uncomfortable around books and reading even those who werent Vorin She pushed through the doorstout wood set with two crystal panelsand stepped into a warm room uncertain what to expect Shed never gone into a store to purchase anything shed either sent servants or the merchants had come to her The room inside looked very inviting with large comfortable easy chairs beside a hearth Flamespren danced on burning logs there and the floor was wood Seamless wood it had probably been Soulcast that way directly from the stone beneath Lavish indeed A woman stood behind a counter at the back of the room She wore an embroidered skirt and blouse rather than the sleek silk onepiece havah that Shallan wore She was darkeyed but she was obviously affluent In Vorin kingdoms shed likely be of the first or second nahn Thaylens had their own system of ranks At least they werent completely paganthey respected eye color and the woman wore a glove on her safehand There werent many books in the place A few on the counter one on a stand beside the chairs A clock ticked on the wall its underside hung with a dozen shimmering silver bells This looked more like a persons home than a shop The woman slid a marker into her book smiling at Shallan It was a smooth eager smile Almost predatory Please Brightness sit she said waving toward the chairs The woman had curled her long white Thaylen eyebrows so they hung down the sides of her face like locks from her bangs Shallan sat hesitantly as the woman rang a bell on the underside of the counter Soon a portly man waddled into the room wearing a vest that seemed ready to burst from the stress of holding in his girth His hair was greying and he kept his eyebrows combed back over his ears Ah he said clapping ample hands dear young woman Are you in the market for a nice novel Some leisure reading to pass the cruel hours while you are separated from a lost love Or perhaps a book on geography with details of exotic locations He had a slightly condescending tone and spoke in her native Veden INo thank you I need an extensive set of books on history and three on philosophy She thought back trying to recall the names Jasnah had used Something by Placini Gabrathin Yustara Manaline or ShaukadaughterHasweth Heavy reading for one so young the man said nodding to the woman who was probably his wife She ducked into the back room Hed use her for reading even if he could read himself he wouldnt want to off end customers by doing so in their presence He would handle the money commerce was a masculine art in most situations Now why is a young flower like yourself bothering herself with such topics the merchant said easing himself down into the chair across from her Cant I interest you in a nice romantic novel They are my specialty you see Young women from across the city come to me and I always carry the best His tone set her on edge It was galling enough to know she was a sheltered child Was it really necessary to remind her of it A romantic novel she said holding her satchel close to her chest Yes perhaps that would be nice Do you by chance have a copy of Nearer the Flame The merchant blinked Nearer the Flame was written from the viewpoint of a man who slowly descended into madness after watching his children starve Are you certain you want something so er ambitious the man asked Is ambition such an unseemly attribute in a young woman Well no I suppose not He smiled againthe thick toothy smile of a merchant trying to put someone at ease I can see you are a woman of discriminating taste I am Shallan said voice firm though her heart fluttered Was she destined to get into an argument with everyone she met I do like my meals prepared very carefully as my palate is quite delicate Pardon I meant that you have discriminating taste in books Ive never eaten one actually Brightness I believe you are having sport with me Not yet Im not I havent even really begun I Now she said you were right to compare the mind and the stomach But Too many of us she said take great pains with what we ingest through our mouths and far less with what we partake of through our ears and eyes Wouldnt you say He nodded perhaps not trusting her to let him speak without interrupting Shallan knew somewhere in the back of her mind that she was letting herself go too farthat she was tense and frustrated after her interactions with Jasnah She didnt care at the moment Discriminating she said testing the world Im not certain I agree with your choice of words To discriminate is to maintain prejudice against To be exclusive Can a person afford to be exclusive with what they ingest Whether we speak of food or of thoughts I think they must be the merchant said Isnt that what you just said I said we should take thought for what we read or eat Not that we should be exclusive Tell me what do you think would happen to a person who ate only sweets I know well the man said I have a sisterinlaw who periodically upsets her stomach by doing that See she was too discriminating The body needs many different foods to remain healthy And the mind needs many different ideas to remain sharp Wouldnt you agree And so if I were to read only these silly romances you presume that my ambition can handle my mind would grow sick as surely as your sisterinlaws stomach Yes I should think that the metaphor is a solid one You are quite clever Master Artmyrn His smile returned Of course she noted not smiling back being talked down to upsets both the mind and the stomach So nice of you to give a poignant object lesson to accompany your brilliant metaphor Do you treat all of your customers this way BrightnessI believe you stray into sarcasm Funny I thought Id run straight into it screaming at the top of my lungs He blushed and stood Ill go help my wife He hurriedly withdrew She sat back and realized she was annoyed at herself for letting her frustration boil out It was just what her nurses had warned her about A young woman had to mind her words Her fathers intemperate tongue had earned their house a regrettable reputation would she add to it She calmed herself enjoying the warmth and watching the dancing flamespren until the merchant and his wife returned bearing several stacks of books The merchant took his seat again and his wife pulled over a stool setting the tomes on the floor and then showing them one at a time as her husband spoke For history we have two choices the merchant said condescensionand friendlinessgone Times and Passage by Rencalt is a single volume survey of Rosharan history since the Hierocracy His wife held up a red clothbound volume I told my wife that you would likely be insulted by such a shallow option but she insisted Thank you Shallan said I am not insulted but I do require something more detailed Then perhaps Eternathis will serve you he said as his wife held up a bluegrey set of four volumes It is a philosophical work which examines the same time period by focusing only on the interactions of the five Vorin kingdoms As you can see the treatment is exhaustive The four volumes were thick The five Vorin kingdoms Shed thought there were four Jah Keved Alethkar Kharbranth and Natanatan United by religion they had been strong allies during the years following the Recreance What was the fifth kingdom The volumes intrigued her I will take them Excellent the merchant said a bit of the gleam returning to his eye Of the philosophical works you listed we didnt have anything by Yustara We have one each of works by Placini and Manaline both are collections of excerpts from their most famous writings Ive had the Placini book read to me its quite good Shallan nodded As for Gabrathin he said we have four different volumes My but he was a prolific one Oh and we have a single book by ShaukadaughterHasweth The wife held up a thin green volume I have to admit Ive never had any of her work read to me I didnt realize that there were any Shin philosophers of note Shallan looked at the four books by Gabrathin She had no idea which one she should take so she avoided the question pointing at the two collections he had mentioned first and the single volume by ShaukadaughterHasweth A philosopher from distant Shin where people lived in mud and worshipped rocks The man who had killed Jasnahs father nearly six years beforeprompting the war against the Parshendi in Natanatanhad been Shin The Assassin in White they called him I will take those three Shallan said along with the histories Excellent the merchant repeated For buying so many I will give you a fair discount Let us say ten emerald broams Shallan nearly choked An emerald broam was the largest denomination of sphere worth a thousand diamond chips Ten of them was more than her trip to Kharbranth had cost by several magnitudes She opened her satchel looking in at her money pouch She had around eight emerald broams left Shed have to take fewer of the books obviously but which ones Suddenly the door slammed open Shallan jumped and was surprised to see Yalb standing there holding his cap in his hands nervous He rushed to her chair going down on one knee She was too stunned to say anything Why was he so worried Brightness he said bowing his head My master bids you return Hes reconsidered his offer Truly we can take the price you offered Shallan opened her mouth but found herself stupefied Yalb glanced at the merchant Brightness dont buy from this man Hes a liar and a cheat My master will sell you much finer books at a better price Now whats this Artmyrn said standing How dare you Who is your master Barmest Yalb said defensively That rat He sends a boy into my shop trying to steal my customer Outrageous She came to our shop first Yalb said Shallan finally recovered her wits Stormfather Hes quite the actor You had your chance she said to Yalb Run along and tell your master that I refuse to be swindled I will visit every bookshop in the city if that is what it takes to find someone reasonable Artmyrn isnt reasonable Yalb said spitting to the side The merchants eyes opened wide with rage We shall see Shallan said Brightness Artmyrn said red faced Surely you dont believe these allegations And how much were you going to charge her Yalb asked Ten emerald broams Shallan said For those seven books Yalb laughed And you didnt stand up and walk right out You practically had my masters ears and he offered you a better deal than that Please Brightness return with me Were ready to Ten was just an opening figure Artmyrn said I didnt expect her to take them He looked at Shallan Of course eight Yalb laughed again Im sure we have those same books Brightness Ill bet my master gives them to you for two Artmyrn grew even more redfaced muttering Brightness surely you wouldnt patronize someone so crass as to send a servant into someone elses shop to steal his customers Perhaps I would Shallan said At least he didnt insult my intelligence Artmyrns wife glared at her husband and the man grew even more red in the face Two emerald three sapphire That is as low as I can go If you want cheaper than that then buy from that scoundrel Barmest The books will probably be missing pages though Shallan hesitated glancing at Yalb he was caught up in his role bowing and scraping She caught his eyes and he just kind of gave a shrug Ill do it she said to Artmyrn prompting a groan from Yalb He slunk away with a curse from Artmyrns wife Shallan rose and counted out the spheres the emerald broams she retrieved from her safepouch Soon she walked from the shop bearing a heavy canvas bag She walked down the steep street and found Yalb lounging beside a lamppost She smiled as he took the bag from her How did you know what a fair price for a book was she asked Fair price he said slinging the bag over his shoulder For a book Ive no idea I just figured hed be trying to take you for as much as he could Thats why I asked around for who his biggest rival was and came back to help get him to be more reasonable It was that obvious Id let myself be swindled she asked with a blush the two of them walking out of the side street Yalb chuckled Just a little Anyway conning men like him is almost as much fun as cheating guards You probably could have gotten him down further by actually leaving with me then coming back later to give him another chance That sounds complicated Merchants is like mercenaries my gammer always said Only difference is that merchants will take your head off then pretend to be your friend all the same This from a man who had just spent the evening cheating a group of guards at cards Well you have my thanks anyway Wasnt nothing It was fun though I cant believe you paid what you did Its just a bunch of wood I could find some driftwood and put some funny marks on it Would you pay me pure spheres for that too I cant offer that she said fishing in her satchel She took out the picture shed drawn of Yalb and the porter But please take this with my thanks Yalb took the picture and stepped up beneath a nearby lantern to get a look He laughed cocking his head smiling broadly Stormfather Aint that something Looks like Im seeing myself in a polished plate it does I cant take this Brightness Please I insist She did however blink her eyes taking a Memory of him standing there one hand on his chin as he studied the picture of himself Shed redraw him later After what hed done for her she dearly wanted him in her collection Yalb carefully tucked the picture between the pages of a book then hefted the bag and continued They stepped back onto the main roadway Nomonthe middle moonhad begun to rise bathing the city in pale blue light Staying up this late had been a rare privilege for her in her fathers house but these city people around them barely seemed to notice the late hour What a strange place this city was Back to the ship now Yalb asked No Shallan said taking a deep breath Back to the Conclave He raised an eyebrow but led her back Once there she bid Yalb farewell reminding him to take his picture He did so wishing her luck before hastening from the Conclave probably worried about meeting the guardsmen hed cheated earlier Shallan had a servant carry her books and made her way down the hallway back to the Veil Just inside the ornate iron doors she caught the attention of a masterservant Yes Brightness the man asked Most of the alcoves were now dim and patient servants were returning tomes to their safe place beyond the crystal walls Shaking off her fatigue Shallan counted up the rows There was still a light in Jasnahs alcove Id like to use the alcove there she said pointing to the next balcony over Do you have a chit of admittance Im afraid not Then youll have to rent the space if you wish to use it regularly Two skymarks Wincing at the price Shallan dug out the proper spheres and paid Her money pouches were looking depressingly flat She let the parshman porters haul her up to the appropriate level then she quietly walked to her alcove There she used all her remaining spheres to fill the oversized goblet lamp To get enough light she was forced to use spheres of all nine colors and all three sizes so the illumination was patchy and varied Shallan peeked over the side of her alcove out at the next balcony over Jasnah sat studying heedless of the hour her goblet filled to the brim with pure diamond broams They were best for light but less useful in Soulcasting so werent as valuable Shallan ducked back around There was a place at the very edge of the alcoves table where she could sit hidden by the wall from Jasnah so she sat there Perhaps she should have chosen an alcove on another level but she wanted to keep an eye on the woman Hopefully Jasnah would spend weeks here studying Enough time for Shallan to dedicate herself to some fierce cramming Her ability to memorize pictures and scenes didnt work as well on text but she could learn lists and facts at a rate that her tutors had found remarkable She settled herself in the chair pulling out the books and arranging them She rubbed her eyes It was really quite late but there wasnt time to waste Jasnah had said that Shallan could make another petition when the gaps in her knowledge were filled Well Shallan intended to fill those gaps in record time then present herself again Shed do it when Jasnah was ready to leave Kharbranth It was a last desperate hope so frail that a strong gust of circumstance seemed likely to topple it Taking a deep breath Shallan opened the first of the history books Im never going to be rid of you am I a soft feminine voice asked Shallan jumped up nearly knocking over her books as she spun toward the doorway Jasnah Kholin stood there deep blue dress embroidered in silver its silken sheen reflecting the light of Shallans spheres The Soulcaster was covered by a fingerless black glove to block the bright gemstones Brightness Shallan said rising and curtsying in an awkward rush I didnt mean to disturb you I Jasnah quieted her with a wave of the hand She stepped aside as a parshman entered Shallans alcove carrying a chair He placed it beside Shallans desk and Jasnah glided over and sat Shallan tried to judge Jasnahs mood but the older womans emotions were impossible to read I honestly didnt want to disturb you I bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil Jasnah said idly picking up one of Shallans tomes reading the title I didnt want to be interrupted again I Shallan looked down blushing furiously Dont bother apologizing Jasnah said She looked tired more tired than Shallan felt Jasnah picked through the books A fine selection You chose well It wasnt really much of a choice Shallan said It was just about all the merchant had You intended to study their contents quickly I assume Jasnah said musingly Try to impress me one last time before I left Kharbranth Shallan hesitated then nodded A clever ploy I should have put a time restriction on your reapplication She looked at Shallan glancing her over You are very determined That is good And I know why you wish so desperately to be my ward Shallan started She knew Your house has many enemies Jasnah continued and your father is reclusive It will be difficult for you to marry well without a tactically sound alliance Shallan relaxed though she tried to keep it from showing Let me see your satchel Jasnah said Shallan frowned resisting the urge to pull it close Brightness Jasnah held out her hand You recall what I said about repeating myself Reluctantly Shallan handed it over Jasnah carefully removed its contents neatly lining up the brushes pencils pens jar of lacquer ink and solvent She placed the stacks of paper the notebooks and the finished pictures in a line Then she got out Shallans money pouches noting their emptiness She glanced at the goblet lamp counting its contents She raised an eyebrow Next she began to look through Shallans pictures First the looseleaf ones where she lingered on Shallans picture of Jasnah herself Shallan watched the womans face Was she pleased Surprised Displeased at how much time Shallan spent sketching sailors and serving women Finally Jasnah moved on to the sketchbook filled with drawings of plants and animals Shallan had observed during her trip Jasnah spent the longest on this reading through each notation Why have you made these sketches Jasnah asked at the end Why Brightness Well because I wanted to She grimaced Should she have said something profound instead Jasnah nodded slowly Then she rose I have rooms in the Conclave granted to me by the king Gather your things and go there You look exhausted Brightness Shallan asked rising a thrill of excitement running through her Jasnah hesitated at the doorway At first meeting I took you for a rural opportunist seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth Youve changed your mind No Jasnah said there is undoubtedly some of that in you But we are each many different people and you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them If that notebook is any indication you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake That is encouraging It is perhaps the best argument you could make on your own behalf If I can not be rid of you then I might as well make use of you Go and sleep Tomorrow we will begin early and you will divide your time between your education and helping me with my studies With that Jasnah withdrew Shallan sat bemused blinking tired eyes She got out a sheet of paper and wrote a quick prayer of thanks which shed burn later Then she hurriedly gathered up her books and went looking for a servant to send to the Winds Pleasure for her trunk It had been a very very long day But shed won The first step had been completed Now her real task began Ten people with Shardblades alight standing before a wall of black and white and red Collected Jesachev 1173 12 seconds predeath Subject one of our own ardents overheard during his last moments Kaladin had not been assigned to Bridge Four by chance Out of all the bridge crews Bridge Four had the highest casualty rate That was particularly notable considering that average bridge crews often lost onethird to onehalf of their number on a single run Kaladin sat outside back to the barrack wall a sprinkle of rain falling on him It wasnt a highstorm Just an ordinary spring rain Soft A timid cousin to the great storms Syl sat on Kaladins shoulder Or hovered on it Whatever She didnt seem to have any weight Kaladin sat slumped chin against his chest staring at a dip in the stone which was slowly collecting rainwater He should have moved inside Bridge Fours barrack It was cold and unfurnished but it would keep off the rain But he justcouldnt care How long had he been with Bridge Four now Two weeks Three An eternity Of the twentyfive men who had survived his first bridge deployment twentythree were now dead Two had been moved to other bridge crews because theyd done something to please Gaz but theyd died there Only one other man and Kaladin remained Two out of nearly forty The bridge crews numbers had been replenished with more unfortunates and most of those had died too They had been replaced Many of those had died Bridgeleader after bridgeleader had been chosen It was supposed to be a favored position on a bridge crew always getting to run in the best places It didnt matter for Bridge Four Some bridge runs werent as bad If the Alethi arrived before the Parshendi no bridgemen died And if they arrived too late sometimes another highprince was already there Sadeas wouldnt help in that case hed take his army and go back to camp Even in a bad run the Parshendi would often choose to focus their arrows on certain crews trying to bring them down one at a time Sometimes dozens of bridgemen would fall but not a single one from Bridge Four That was rare For some reason Bridge Four always seemed to get targeted Kaladin didnt bother to learn the names of his companions None of the bridgemen did What was the point Learn a mans name and one of you would be dead before the week was out Odds were youd both be dead Maybe he should learn names Then hed have someone to talk to in Damnation They could reminisce about how terrible Bridge Four had been and agree that eternal fires were much more pleasant He smirked dully still staring at the rock in front of him Gaz would come for them soon send them to work Scrubbing latrines cleaning streets mucking stables gathering rocks Something to keep their minds off their fate He still didnt know why they fought on those blustering plateaus Something about those large chrysalises They had gemstones at their hearts apparently But what did that have to do with the Vengeance Pact Another bridgemana youthful Veden with reddishblond hairlay nearby staring up into the spitting sky Rainwater pooled in the corners of his brown eyes then ran down his face He didnt blink They couldnt run The warcamp might as well have been a prison The bridgemen could go to the merchants and spend their meager earnings on cheap wine or whores but they couldnt leave the warcamp The perimeter was secure Partially this was to keep out soldiers from the other campsthere was always rivalry where armies met But mostly it was so bridgemen and slaves could not flee Why Why did this all have to be so horrible None of it made sense Why not let a few bridgemen run out in front of the bridges with shields to block arrows Hed asked and had been told that would slow them down too much Hed asked again and had been told hed be strung up if he didnt shut his mouth The lighteyes acted as if this entire mess were some kind of grand game If it was the rules were hidden from bridgemen just as pieces on a board had no inkling what the players strategy might be Kaladin Syl asked floating down and landing on his leg holding the girlish form with the long dress flowing into mist Kaladin You havent spoken in days He kept staring slumped There was a way out Bridgemen could visit the chasm nearest the camp There were rules forbidding it but the sentries ignored them It was seen as the one mercy that could be given the bridgemen Bridgemen who took that path never returned Kaladin Syl said voice soft worried My father used to say that there are two kinds of people in the world Kaladin whispered voice raspy He said there are those who take lives And there are those who save lives Syl frowned cocking her head This kind of conversation confused her she wasnt good with abstractions I used to think he was wrong I thought there was a third group People who killed in order to save He shook his head I was a fool There is a third group a big one but it isnt what I thought What group she said sitting down on his knee brow scrunched up The people who exist to be saved or to be killed The group in the middle The ones who cant do anything but die or be protected The victims Thats all I am He looked up across the wet lumberyard The carpenters had retreated throwing tarps over untreated wood and bearing away tools that could rust The bridgeman barracks ran around the west and north sides of the yard Bridge Fours was set off a little from the others as if bad luck were a disease that could be caught Contagious by proximity as Kaladins father would say We exist to be killed Kaladin said He blinked glancing at the other few members of Bridge Four sitting apathetically in the rain If were not dead already I hate seeing you like this Syl said buzzing about Kaladins head as his team of bridgemen dragged a log down into the lumberyard The Parshendi often set fire to the outermost permanent bridges so Highprince Sadeass engineers and carpenters were always busy The old Kaladin might have wondered why the armies didnt work harder to defend the bridges Theres something wrong here a voice inside him said Youre missing part of the puzzle They waste resources and bridgeman lives They dont seem to care about pushing inward and assaulting the Parshendi They just fight pitched battles on plateaus then come back to the camps and celebrate Why WHY He ignored that voice It belonged to the man he had been You used to be vibrant Syl said So many looked up to you Kaladin Your squad of soldiers The enemies you fought The other slaves Even some lighteyes Lunch would come soon Then he could sleep until their bridgeleader kicked him awake for afternoon duty I used to watch you fight Syl said I can barely remember it My memories of then are fuzzy Like looking at you through a rainstorm Wait That was odd Syl hadnt started following him until after his fall from the army And shed acted just like a regular windspren back then He hesitated earning a curse and a lash on his back from a taskmasters whip He started pulling again Bridgemen who were laggard in work were whipped and bridgemen who were laggard on runs were executed The army was very serious about that Refuse to charge the Parshendi try to lag behind the other bridges and youd be beheaded They reserved that fate for that specific crime in fact There were lots of ways to get punished as a bridgeman You could earn extra work detail get whipped have your pay docked If you did something really bad theyd string you up for the Stormfathers judgment leaving you tied to a post or a wall to face a highstorm But the only thing you could do to be executed directly was refuse to run at the Parshendi The message was clear Charging with your bridge might get you killed but refusing to do so would get you killed Kaladin and his crew lifted their log into a pile with others then unhooked their dragging lines They walked back toward the edge of the lumberyard where more logs waited Gaz a voice called A tall yellowandblackhaired soldier stood at the edge of the bridge grounds a group of miserable men huddled behind him That was Laresh one of the soldiers who worked the duty tent He brought new bridgemen to replace those whod been killed The day was bright without a hint of clouds and the sun was hot on Kaladins back Gaz hustled up to meet the new recruits and Kaladin and the others happened to be walking in that direction to pick up a log What a sorry lot Gaz said looking over the recruits Of course if they werent they wouldnt be sent here Thats the truth Laresh said These ten at the front were caught smuggling You know what to do New bridgemen were constantly needed but there were always enough bodies Slaves were common but so were thieves or other lawbreakers from among the camp followers Never parshmen They were too valuable and besides the Parshendi were some kind of cousins to the parshmen Better not to give the parshman workers in camp the sight of their kind fighting Sometimes a soldier would be thrown into a bridge crew That only happened if hed done something extremely bad like striking an officer Acts that would earn a hanging in many armies meant being sent to the bridge crews here Supposedly if you survived a hundred bridge runs youd be released It had happened once or twice the stories said It was probably just a myth intended to give the bridgemen some tiny hope for survival Kaladin and the others walked past the newcomers gazes down and began hooking their ropes to the next log Bridge Four needs some men Gaz said rubbing his chin Four always needs men Laresh said Dont worry I brought a special batch for it He nodded toward a second group of recruits much more ragtag walking up behind Kaladin slowly stood upright One of the prisoners in that group was a boy of barely fourteen or fifteen Short spindly with a round face Tien he whispered taking a step forward He stopped shaking himself Tien was dead But this newcomer looked so familiar with those frightened black eyes It made Kaladin want to shelter the boy Protect him Buthed failed Everyone hed tried to protectfrom Tien to Cennhad ended up dead What was the point He turned back to dragging the log Kaladin Syl said landing on the log Im going to leave He blinked in shock Syl Leave Butshe was the last thing he had left No he whispered It came out as a croak Ill try to come back she said But I dont know what will happen when I leave you Things are strange I have odd memories No most of them arent even memories Instincts One of those tells me that if I leave you I might lose myself Then dont go he said growing terrified I have to she said cringing I cant watch this anymore Ill try to return She looked sorrowful Goodbye And with that she zipped away into the air adopting the form of a tiny group of tumbling translucent leaves Kaladin watched her go numb Then he turned back to hauling the log What else could he do The youth the one that reminded him of Tien died during the very next bridge run It was a bad one The Parshendi were in position waiting for Sadeas Kaladin charged the chasm not even flinching as men were slaughtered around him It wasnt bravery that drove him it wasnt even a wish that those arrows would take him and end it all He ran That was what he did Like a boulder rolled down a hill or like rain fell from the sky They didnt have a choice Neither did he He wasnt a man he was a thing and things just did what they did The bridgemen laid their bridges in a tight line Four crews had fallen Kaladins own team had lost nearly enough stop them Bridge placed Kaladin turned away the army charging across the wood to start the real battle He stumbled back across the plateau After a few moments he found what he was looking for The boys body Kaladin stood wind whipping at his hair looking down at the corpse It lay faceup in a small hollow in the stone Kaladin remembered lying in a similar hollow holding a similar corpse Another bridgeman had fallen nearby bristling with arrows It was the man whod lived through Kaladins first bridge run all those weeks back His body slumped to the side lying on a stone outcropping a foot or so above the corpse of the boy Blood dripped from the tip of an arrow sticking out his back It fell one ruby drop at a time splattering on the boys open lifeless eye A little trail of red ran from the eye down the side of his face Like crimson tears That night Kaladin huddled in the barrack listening to a highstorm buff et the wall He curled against the cold stone Thunder shattered the sky outside I cant keep going like this he thought Im dead inside as sure as if Id taken a spear through the neck The storm continued its tirade And for the first time in a year Kaladin found himself crying NINE YEARS AGO Kal stumbled into the surgery room the open door letting in bright white sunlight At ten years old he was already showing signs that he would be tall and lanky Hed always preferred Kal to his full name Kaladin The shorter name made him fit in better Kaladin sounded like a lighteyess name Im sorry Father he said Kals father Lirin carefully tightened the strap around the arm of the young woman who was tied onto the narrow operating table Her eyes were closed Kal had missed the administration of the drug We will discuss your tardiness later Lirin said securing the womans other hand Close the door Kal cringed and closed the door The windows were dark shutters firmly in place and so the only light was that of the Stormlight shining from a large globe filled with spheres Each of those spheres was a broam in total an incredible sum that was on permanent loan from Hearthstones landlord Lanterns flickered but Stormlight was always true That could save lives Kals father said Kal approached the table anxious The young woman Sani had sleek black hair not tinged with even a single strand of brown or blond She was fifteen and her freehand was wrapped with a bloody ragged bandage Kal grimaced at the clumsy bandaging jobit looked like the cloth had been ripped from someones shirt and tied in haste Sanis head rolled to the side and she mumbled drugged She wore only a white cotton shift her safehand exposed Older boys in the town sniggered about the chances theyd hador claimed to have hadat seeing girls in their shifts but Kal didnt understand what the excitement was all about He was worried about Sani though He always worried when someone was wounded Fortunately the wound didnt look terrible If it had been lifethreatening his father would have already begun working on it using Kals motherHesinaas an assistant Lirin walked to the side of the room and gathered up a few small clear bottles He was a short man balding despite his relative youth He wore his spectacles which he called the most precious gift hed ever been given He rarely got them out except for surgery as they were too valuable to risk just wearing about What if they were scratched or broken Hearthstone was a large town but its remote location in northern Alethkar would make replacing the spectacles difficult The room was kept neat the shelves and table washed clean each morning everything in its place Lirin said you could tell a lot about a man from how he kept his workspace Was it sloppy or orderly Did he respect his tools or did he leave them casually about The towns only fabrial clock sat here on the counter The small device bore a single dial at the center and a glowing Smokestone at its heart it had to be infused to keep the time Nobody else in the town cared about minutes and hours as Lirin did Kal pulled over a stool to get a better vantage Soon he wouldnt need the stool he was growing taller by the day He inspected Sanis hand Shell be all right he told himself as his father had trained him A surgeon needs to be calm Worry just wastes time It was hard advice to follow Hands Lirin said not turning away from gathering his tools Kal sighed hopping off his stool and hurrying over to the basin of warm soapy water by the door Why does it matter He wanted to be at work helping Sani Wisdom of the Heralds Lirin said absently repeating a lecture hed given many times before Deathspren and rotspren hate water It will keep them away Hammie says thats silly Kal said He says deathspren are mighty good at killing folk so why should they be afraid of a little water The Heralds were wise beyond our understanding Kal grimaced But theyre demons father I heard it off that ardent who came teaching last spring Thats the Radiants he spoke of Lirin said sharply Youre mixing them again Kal sighed The Heralds were sent to teach mankind Lirin said They led us against the Voidbringers after we were cast from heaven The Radiants were the orders of knights they founded Who were demons Who betrayed us Lirin said once the Heralds left Lirin raised a finger They were not demons they were just men who had too much power and not enough sense Either way you are always to wash your hands You can see the effect it has on rotspren with your own eyes even if deathspren can not be seen Kal sighed again but did as he was told Lirin walked over to the table again bearing a tray lined with knives and little glass bottles His ways were oddthough Lirin made certain that his son didnt mix up the Heralds and the Lost Radiants Kal had heard his father say that he thought the Voidbringers werent real Ridiculous Who else could be blamed when things went missing in the night or when a crop got infected with diggerworms The others in town thought Lirin spent too much time with books and sick people and that made him strange They were uncomfortable around him and with Kal by association Kal was only just beginning to realize how painful it could feel to be different Hands washed he hopped back up onto the stool He began to feel nervous again hoping that nothing would go wrong His father used a mirror to focus the spheres light onto Sanis hand Gingerly he cut off the makeshift bandage with a surgeons knife The wound wasnt lifethreatening but the hand was pretty badly mangled When his father had started training Kal two years before sights like this had sickened him Now he was used to torn flesh That was good Kal figured this would be useful when he went to war someday to fight for his highprince and the lighteyes Sani had three broken fingers and the skin on her hand was scraped and gouged the wound cluttered with sticks and dirt The third finger was the worst shattered and twisted nastily splinters of bone protruding through the skin Kal felt its length noting the fractured bones the blackness on the skin He carefully wiped away dried blood and dirt with a wet cloth picking out rocks and sticks as his father cut thread for sewing The third finger will have to go wont it Kal said tying a bandage around the base of the finger to keep it from bleeding His father nodded a hint of a smile on his face Hed hoped Kal would discern that Lirin often said that a wise surgeon must know what to remove and what to save If that third finger had been set properly at firstbut no it was beyond recovery Sewing it back together would mean leaving it to fester and die His father did the actual amputation He had such careful precise hands Training as a surgeon took over ten years and it would be some time yet before Lirin let Kal hold the knife Instead Kal wiped away blood handed his father knives and held the sinew to keep it from tangling as his father sewed They repaired the hand so far as they could working with deliberate speed Kals father finished the final suture obviously pleased at having been able to save four of the fingers That wasnt how Sanis parents would see it Theyd be disappointed that their beautiful daughter would now have a disfigured hand It almost always happened that wayterror at the initial wound then anger at Lirins inability to work wonders Lirin said it was because the townsfolk had grown accustomed to having a surgeon To them the healing had become an expectation rather than a privilege But Sanis parents were good people Theyd make a small donation and Kals familyhis parents him and his younger brother Tienwould continue to be able to eat Odd how they survived because of others misfortune Maybe that was part of what made the townsfolk resent them Lirin finished by using a small heated rod to cauterize where he felt the stitches wouldnt be enough Finally he spread pungent listers oil across the hand to prevent infectionthe oil frightened away rotspren even better than soap and water Kal wrapped on clean bandages careful not to disturb the splints Lirin disposed of the finger and Kal began to relax Shed be all right You still need to work on those nerves of yours son Lirin said softly washing blood from his hands Kal looked down It is good to care Lirin said But caringlike anything elsecan be a problem if it interferes with your ability to perform surgery Caring too much can be a problem Kal thought back at his father And what about being so selfless that you never charge for your work He didnt dare say the words Cleaning the room came next It seemed like half of Kals life was spent cleaning but Lirin wouldnt let him go until they were done with it At least he opened the shutters letting sunlight stream in Sani continued to doze the winterwort would keep her unconscious for hours yet So where were you Lirin asked bottles of oil and alcohol clinking as he returned them to their places With Jam Jam is two years your senior Lirin said I doubt he has much fondness for spending his time with those much younger than he His father started training him in the quarterstaff Kal said in a rush Tien and I went to see what hes learned Kal cringed waiting for the lecture His father just continued wiping down each of his surgeons knives with alcohol then oil as the old traditions dictated He didnt turn toward Kal Jams father was a soldier in Brightlord Amarams army Kal said tentatively Brightlord Amaram The noble lighteyed general who watched over northern Alethkar Kal wanted so much to see a real lighteyes not stuffy old Wistiow A soldier like everyone talked about like the stories were about I know about Jams father Lirin said Ive had to operate on that lame leg of his three times now A gift of his glorious time as a soldier We need soldiers father Youd have our borders violated by the Thaylens Thaylenah is an island kingdom Lirin said calmly They dont share a border with us Well then they could attack from sea Theyre mostly tradesmen and merchants Every one Ive met has tried to swindle me but thats hardly the same thing as invading All the boys liked to tell stories about faroff places It was hard to remember that Kals fatherthe only man of second nahn in the townhad traveled all the way to Kharbranth during his youth Well we fight with someone Kal continued moving to scrub the floor Yes his father said after a pause King Gavilar always finds people for us to fight That much is true So we need soldiers like I said We need surgeons more Lirin sighed audibly turning away from his cabinet Son you nearly cry each time someone is brought to us you grind your teeth anxiously during even simple procedures What makes you think you could actually hurt someone Ill get stronger Thats foolishness Whos put these ideas in your head Why would you want to learn to hit other boys with a stick For honor Father Kal said Who tells stories about surgeons for the Heraldss sake The children of the men and women whose lives we save Lirin said evenly meeting Kals gaze Thats who tell stories of surgeons Kal blushed and shrank back then finally returned to his scrubbing There are two kinds of people in this world son his father said sternly Those who save lives And those who take lives And what of those who protect and defend The ones who save lives by taking lives His father snorted Thats like trying to stop a storm by blowing harder Ridiculous You cant protect by killing Kal kept scrubbing Finally his father sighed walking over and kneeling down beside him helping with the scrubbing What are the properties of winterwort Bitter taste Kal said immediately which makes it safer to keep since people wont eat it by accident Crush it to powder mix it with oil use one spoonful per ten brickweight of the person youre drugging Induces a deep sleep for about five hours And how can you tell if someone has the fiddlepox Nervous energy Kal said thirst trouble sleeping and swelling on the undersides of the arms Youve got such a good mind son Lirin said softly It took me years to learn what youve done in months Ive been saving Id like to send you to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen to train with real surgeons Kal felt a spike of excitement Kharbranth That was in an entirely different kingdom Kals father had traveled there as a courier but he hadnt trained there as a surgeon Hed learned from old Vathe in Shorse broon the nearest town of any size You have a gift from the Heralds themselves Lirin said resting a hand on Kals shoulder You could be ten times the surgeon I am Dont dream the small dreams of other men Our grandfathers bought and worked us to the second nahn so that we could have full citizenship and the right of travel Dont waste that on killing Kal hesitated but soon found himself nodding Three of sixteen ruled but now the Broken One reigns Collected Chachanan 1173 84 seconds predeath Subject a cutpurse with the wasting sickness of partial Iriali descent The highstorm eventually subsided It was the dusk of the day the boy had died the day Syl had left him Kaladin slid on his sandalsthe same ones hed taken from the leatheryfaced man on that first dayand stood up He walked through the crowded barrack There were no beds just one thin blanket per bridgeman One had to choose whether to use it for cushioning or warmth You could freeze or you could ache Those were a bridgemans options though several of the bridgemen had found a third use for the blankets They wrapped them around their heads as if to block out sight sound and smell To hide from the world The world would find them anyway It was good at these kinds of games Rain fell in sheets outside the wind still stiff Flashes lit the western horizon where the center of the storm flew onward This was an hour or so before the riddens and was as early as one would want to go out in a highstorm Well one never wanted to go out in a highstorm But this was about as early as it was safe to go out The lightning had passed the winds were manageable He passed through the dim lumberyard hunched against the wind Branches lay scattered about like bones in a whitespines lair Leaves were plastered by rainwater to the rough sides of barracks Kaladin splashed through puddles that chilled and numbed his feet That felt good they were still sore from the bridge run earlier Waves of icy rain blew across him wetting his hair dripping down his face and into his scruffy beard He hated having a beard particularly the way the whiskers itched at the corners of his mouth Beards were like axehound pups Boys dreamed of the day theyd get one never realizing how annoying they could be Out for a stroll Your Lordship a voice said Kaladin looked up to find Gaz huddled in a nearby hollow between two of the barracks Why was he out in the rain Ah Gaz had fastened a small metal basket on the leeward wall of one of the barracks and a soft glowing light came from within He left his spheres out in the storm then had come out early to retrieve them It was a risk Even a sheltered basket could get torn free Some people believed that the shades of the Lost Radiants haunted the storms stealing spheres Perhaps that was true But during his time in the army Kaladin had known more than one man who had been wounded sneaking around during full storm looking for spheres No doubt the superstition was due to more worldly thieves There were safer ways to infuse spheres Moneychangers would exchange dun spheres for infused ones or you could pay them to infuse yours in one of their safely guarded nests What are you doing Gaz demanded The short oneeyed man clutched the basket to his chest Ill have you strung up if youve stolen anyones spheres Kaladin turned away from him Storm you Ill have you strung up anyway Dont think you can run away there are still sentries You Im going to the Honor Chasm Kaladin said quietly His voice would barely be audible over the storm Gaz shut up The Honor Chasm He lowered his metal basket and made no further objections There was a certain deference given to men who took that road Kaladin continued to cross the courtyard Lordling Gaz called Kaladin turned Leave the sandals and vest Gaz said I dont want to have to send someone down to fetch them Kaladin pulled the leather vest over his head and dropped it to the ground with a splash then left the sandals in a puddle That left him in a dirty shirt and stiff brown trousers both taken off a dead man Kaladin walked through the storm to the east side of the lumberyard A low thundering rumbled from the west The pathway down to the Shattered Plains was familiar to him now Hed run this way a dozen times with the bridge crews There wasnt a battle every dayperhaps one in every two or threeand not every bridge crew had to go on every run But many of the runs were so draining so horrific that they left the bridgemen stunned almost unresponsive for the days between Many bridgemen had trouble making decisions The same happened to men who were shocked by battle Kaladin felt those effects in himself Even deciding to come to the chasm had been difficult But the bleeding eyes of that unnamed boy haunted him He wouldnt make himself go through something like that again He couldnt He reached the base of the slope winddriven rain pelting his face as if trying to shove him back toward the camp He kept on walking up to the nearest chasm The Honor Chasm the bridgemen called it for it was the place where they could make the one decision left to them The honorable decision Death They werent natural these chasms This one started narrow but as it ran toward the east it grew widerand deeperincredibly quickly At only ten feet long the crack was already wide enough that it would be difficult to jump A group of six rope ladders with wooden rungs hung here affixed to spikes in the rock used by bridgemen sent down to salvage from corpses that had fallen into the chasms during bridge runs Kaladin looked out over the plains He couldnt see much through the darkness and rain No this place wasnt natural The land had been broken And now it broke the people who came to it Kaladin walked past the ladders a little farther along the edge of the chasm Then he sat down legs over the side looking down as the rain fell around him the droplets plunging into the dark depths To his sides the more adventurous cremlings had already left their lairs scuttling about feeding on plants that lapped up the rainwater Lirin had once explained that highstorm rains were rich with nutrients Stormwardens in Kholinar and Vedenar had proven that plants given storm water did better than those given lake or river water Why was it that scientists were so excited to discover facts that farmers had known for generations and generations Kaladin watched the drops of water streaking down toward oblivion in the crevasse Little suicidal jumpers Thousands upon thousands of them Millions upon millions Who knew what awaited them in that darkness You couldnt see it couldnt know it until you joined them Leaping off into the void and letting the wind bear you down You were right Father Kaladin whispered You cant stop a storm by blowing harder You cant save men by killing others We should all become surgeons Every last one of us He was rambling But oddly his mind felt clearer now than it had in weeks Perhaps it was the clarity of perspective Most men spent their entire lives wondering about the future Well his future was empty now So he turned backward thinking about his father about Tien about decisions Once his life had seemed simple That was before hed lost his brother before hed been betrayed in Amarams army Would Kaladin go back to those innocent days if he could Would he prefer to pretend everything was simple No Hed had no easy fall like those drops Hed earned his scars Hed bounced off walls bashed his face and hands Hed killed innocent men by accident Hed walked beside those with hearts like blackened coals adoring them Hed scrambled and climbed and fallen and stumbled And now here he was At the end of it all Understanding so much more but somehow feeling no wiser He climbed to his feet on the lip of that chasm and could feel his fathers disappointment looming over him like the thunderheads above He put one foot out over the void Kaladin He froze at the soft but piercing voice A translucent form bobbed in the air approaching through the weakening rain The figure lunged forward then sank then surged higher again like it was bearing something heavy Kaladin brought his foot back and held out his hand Syl unceremoniously alighted upon it shaped like a skyeel clutching something dark in its mouth She switched to the familiar form of a young woman dress fluttering around her legs She held in her hands a narrow dark green leaf with a point divided in three Blackbane What is this Kaladin asked She looked exhausted These things are heavy She lifted the leaf I brought it for you He took the leaf between two fingers Blackbane Poison Why did you bring this to me he said harshly I thought Syl said shying back Well you kept those other leaves so carefully Then you lost them when you tried to help that man in the slave cages I thought it would make you happy to have another one Kaladin almost laughed She had no concept of what shed done fetching him a leaf of one of Roshars most deadly natural poisons because shed wanted to make him happy It was ridiculous And sweet Everything seemed to go wrong when you lost that leaf Syl said in a soft voice Before that you fought I failed She cowered down kneeling on his palm misty skirt around her legs drops of rainwater passing through her and rippling her form You dont like it then I flew so farI almost forgot myself But I came back I came back Kaladin Why he pled Why do you care Because I do she said cocking her head I watched you you know Back in that army Youd always find the young untrained men and protect them even though it put you into danger I can remember Just barely but I do I failed them Theyre dead now They would have died more quickly without you You made it so they had a family in the army I remember their gratitude Its what drew me in the first place You helped them No he said clutching the blackbane in his fingers Everything I touch withers and dies He teetered on the ledge Thunder rumbled in the distance Those men in the bridge crew Syl whispered You could help them Too late He closed his eyes thinking of the dead boy earlier in the day Its too late Ive failed Theyre dead Theyre all going to die and theres no way out What is one more try then Her voice was soft yet somehow stronger than the storm What could it hurt He paused You cant fail this time Kaladin Youve said it Theyre all going to die anyway He thought of Tien and his dead eyes staring upward I dont know what you mean most of the time when you speak she said My mind is so cloudy But it seems that if youre worried about hurting people you shouldnt be afraid to help the bridgemen What more could you do to them I One more try Kaladin Syl whispered Please One more try The men huddled in the barrack with barely a blanket to call their own Frightened of the storm Frightened of each other Frightened of what the next day would bring One more try He thought of himself crying at the death of a boy he hadnt known A boy he hadnt even tried to help One more try Kaladin opened his eyes He was cold and wet but he felt a tiny warm candle flame of determination come alight inside him He clenched his hand crushing the blackbane leaf inside then dropped it over the side of the chasm He lowered the other hand which had been holding Syl She zipped up into the air anxious Kaladin He stalked away from the chasm bare feet splashing in puddles and stepping heedlessly on rockbud vines The incline hed come down was covered with flat slatelike plants that had opened like books to the rain ruffled lacy red and green leaves connecting the two halves Lifesprenlittle green blips of light brighter than Syl but small as sporesdanced among the plants dodging raindrops Kaladin strode up water streaming past him in tiny rivers At the top he returned to the bridge yard It was still empty save for Gaz who was tying a ripped tarp back into place Kaladin had crossed most of the distance to the man before Gaz noticed him The wiry sergeant scowled Too cowardly to go through with it Your Lordship Well if you think Im giving back He cut off with a gagging noise as Kaladin lunged forward grabbing Gaz by the neck Gaz lifted an arm in surprise but Kaladin batted it away and swept the mans legs out from under him slamming him down to the rocky ground throwing up a splash of water Gazs eyes opened wide with shock and pain and he began to strangle under the pressure of Kaladins grip on his throat The world just changed Gaz Kaladin said leaning in close I died down at that chasm Now youve got my vengeful spirit to deal with Squirming Gaz looked about frantically for help that wasnt there Kaladin didnt have trouble holding him down There was one thing about running bridges If you survived long enough it built up the muscles Kaladin let up slightly on Gazs neck allowing him a gasping breath Then Kaladin leaned down further Were going to start over new you and I Clean And I want you to understand something from the start Im already dead You cant hurt me Understand Gaz nodded slowly and Kaladin gave him another breath of frigid humid air Bridge Four is mine Kaladin said You can assign us tasks but Im bridgeleader The other one died today so you have to pick a new leader anyway Understand Gaz nodded again You learn quickly Kaladin said letting the man breathe freely He stepped back and Gaz hesitantly got to his feet There was hatred in his eyes but it was veiled He seemed worried about somethingsomething more than Kaladins threats I want to stop paying down my slave debt Kaladin said How much do bridgemen make Two clearmarks a day Gaz said scowling at him and rubbing his neck So a slave would make half that One diamond mark A pittance but Kaladin would need it Hed also need to keep Gaz in line Ill start taking my wages Kaladin said but you get to keep one mark in five Gaz started glancing at him in the dim overcast light For your efforts Kaladin said For what efforts Kaladin stepped up to him Your efforts in staying the Damnation out of my way Understood Gaz nodded again Kaladin walked away He hated to waste money on a bribe but Gaz needed a consistent repetitive reminder of why he should avoid getting Kaladin killed One mark every five days wasnt much of a reminderbut for a man who was willing to risk going out in the middle of a highstorm to protect his spheres it might be enough Kaladin walked back to Bridge Fours small barrack pulling open the thick wooden door The men huddled inside just as hed left them But something had changed Had they always looked that pathetic Yes They had Kaladin was the one who had changed not they He felt a strange dislocation as if hed allowed himself to forgetif only in partthe last nine months He reached back across time studying the man he had been The man whod still fought and fought well He couldnt be that man againhe couldnt erase the scarsbut he could learn from that man as a new squadleader learned from the victorious generals of the past Kaladin Stormblessed was dead but Kaladin Bridgeman was of the same blood A descendant with potential Kaladin walked to the first huddled figure The man wasnt sleepingwho could sleep through a highstorm The man cringed as Kaladin knelt beside him Whats your name Kaladin asked Syl flitting down and studying the mans face He wouldnt be able to see her The man was older with drooping cheeks brown eyes and closecropped whitesalted hair His beard was short and he didnt have a slave mark Your name Kaladin repeated firmly Storm off the man said rolling over Kaladin hesitated then leaned in speaking in a low voice Look friend You can either tell me your name or Ill keep pestering you Continue refusing and Ill tow you out into that storm and hang you over the chasm by one leg until you tell me The man glanced back over his shoulder Kaladin nodded slowly holding the mans gaze Teft the man finally said My names Teft That wasnt so hard Kaladin said holding out his hand Im Kaladin Your bridgeleader The man hesitated then took Kaladins hand wrinkling his brow in confusion Kaladin vaguely remembered the man Hed been in the crew for a while a few weeks at least Before that hed been on another bridge crew One of the punishments for bridgemen who committed camp infractions was a transfer to Bridge Four Get some rest Kaladin said releasing Tefts hand Were going to have a hard day tomorrow How do you know Teft asked rubbing his bearded chin Because were bridgemen Kaladin said standing Every day is hard Teft hesitated then smiled faintly Kelek knows thats true Kaladin left him moving down the line of huddled figures He visited each man prodding or threatening until the man gave his name They each resisted It was as if their names were the last things they owned and wouldnt be given up cheaply though they seemed surprisedperhaps even encouragedthat someone cared to ask He clutched to these names repeating each one in his head holding them like precious gemstones The names mattered The men mattered Perhaps Kaladin would die in the next bridge run or perhaps he would break under the strain and give Amaram one final victory But as he settled down on the ground to plan he felt that tiny warmth burning steadily within him It was the warmth of decisions made and purpose seized It was responsibility Syl alighted on his leg as he sat whispering the names of the men to himself She looked encouraged Bright Happy He didnt feel any of that He felt grim tired and wet But he wrapped himself in the responsibility he had taken the responsibility for these men He held to it like a climber clung to his last handhold as he dangled from a cliffside He would find a way to protect them THE END OF Part One Ishikk splashed toward the meeting with the strange foreigners whistling softly to himself his pole with buckets on each end resting on his shoulders He wore lake sandals on his submerged feet and a pair of kneelength breeches No shirt Nu Ralik forbid A good Purelaker never covered his shoulders when the sun was shining A man could get sick that way not getting enough sunlight He whistled but not because he was having a pleasant day In point of fact the day Nu Ralik had provided was close to horrible Only five fish swam in Ishikks buckets and four were of the dullest most common variety The tides had been irregular as if the Purelake itself was in a foul mood Bad days were coming sure as the sun and the tide they were The Purelake extended in all directions hundreds of miles wide its glassy surface perfectly transparent At its deepest it was never more than six feet from shimmering surface to the bottomand in most places the warm slowmoving water came up only to about mid calf It was filled with tiny fish colorful cremlings and eellike riverspren The Purelake was life itself Once this land had been claimed by a king Sela Tales the nation had been called one of the Epoch Kingdoms Well they could name it what they wanted but Nu Ralik knew that the boundaries of nature were far more important than the boundaries of nations Ishikk was a Purelaker First and foremost By tide and sun he was He walked confidently through the water though the footing could sometimes be precarious The pleasantly warm water lapped at his legs just below the knees and he made very few splashes He knew to move slowly careful not to put his weight down before he was sure he wasnt stepping on a spikemane or a sharp lip of rock Ahead the village of Fu Abra broke the glassy perfection a cluster of buildings perched on blocks beneath the water Their domed roofs made them look like the rockbuds that sprouted from the ground and they were the only things for miles around that broke the surface of the Purelake Other people walked about here moving with the same slow gait It was possible to run through the water but there was rarely a reason What could be so important that you had to go and make a splash and ruckus getting to it Ishikk shook his head at that Only foreigners were so hasty He nodded to Thaspic a darkskinned man who passed him pulling a small raft It was stacked with a few piles of cloth hed probably taken them out for washing Ho Ishikk the scrawny man said Hows fishing Terrible he called Vun Makak has blighted me right good today And you Lost a shirt while washing Thaspic replied his voice pleasant Ah thats the way of things Are my foreigners here Sure are Over at Maibs place Vun Makak send they dont eat her out of home Ishikk said continuing on his way Or infect her with their constant worries Sun and tides send it Thaspic said with a chuckle continuing on Maibs house was near the center of the village Ishikk wasnt sure what made her want to live inside the building Most nights he did just fine sleeping on his raft It never got cold in the Purelake except during highstorms and you could last through those right well Nu Ralik send the way The Purelake drained into pits and holes when the storms came and so you just shoved your raft into a crevice between two ridges of stone and huddled up next to it using it to break the fury of the tempest The storms werent so bad out here as they were in the East where they flung boulders and blew down buildings Oh hed heard stories about that sort of life Nu Ralik send he never had to go to such a terrible place Besides it was probably cold there Ishikk pitied those who had to live in the cold Why didnt they just come to the Purelake Nu Ralik send that they dont he thought walking up to Maibs place If everyone knew how nice the Purelake was surely theyd all want to live here and there wouldnt be a place to walk without stumbling over some foreigner He stepped up into the building exposing his calves to the air The floor was low enough that a few inches of water still covered it Purelakers liked it that way It was natural though if the tide dropped sometimes buildings would drain Minnows shot out around his toes Common types not worth anything Maib stood inside fixing a pot of fish soup and she nodded to him She was a stout woman and had been chasing Ishikk for years trying to bait him to wed her on account of her fine cooking He just might let her catch him someday His foreigners were in the corner at a table only they would choosethe one that was raised up an extra bit with footrests so that the outsiders wouldnt have to get their toes wet Nu Ralik what fools he thought with amusement Inside out of the sun wearing shirts against its warmth feet out of the tide No wonder their thoughts are so odd He set his buckets down nodding to Maib She eyed him Good fishing Terrible Ah well your soup is free today Ishikk To make up for Vun Makaks cursing Thanks much kindly he said taking a steaming bowl from her She smiled Now he owed her Enough bowls and hed be forced to wed her Theres a kolgril in the bucket for you he noted Caught it early this morning Her stout face grew uncertain A kolgril was a very lucky fish Cured aching joints for a good month after you ate it and sometimes let you see when friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the clouds Maib had quite a fondness for them on account of the finger aches Nu Ralik had sent her One kolgril would be two weeks of soup and would put her in debt to him Vun Makak eye you she muttered in annoyance walking over to check Thats one all right How am I ever going to catch you man Im a fisher Maib he said taking a slurp of his soupthe bowl was shaped for easy slurping Hard to catch a fisher You know that He chuckled to himself walking up to his foreigners as she plucked out the kolgril There were three of them Two were darkskinned Makabaki though they were the strangest Makabaki hed ever seen One was thick limbed where most of his kind were small and fineboned and he had a completely bald head The other was taller with short dark hair lean muscles and broad shoulders In his head Ishikk called them Grump and Blunt on account of their personalities The third man had light tan skin like an Alethi He didnt seem quite right either though The eyes were the wrong shape and his accent was certainly not Alethi He spoke the Selay language worse than the other two and usually stayed quiet He seemed thoughtful though Ishikk called him Thinker Wonder how he earned that scar across his scalp Ishikk thought Life outside the Purelake was very dangerous Lots of wars particularly to the east You are late traveler said tall stiff Blunt He had the build and air of a soldier though none of the three carried weapons Ishikk frowned sitting and reluctantly pulling his feet out of the water Isnt it warliday The day is right friend Grump said But we were to meet at noon Understand He generally did most of the talking Were close to that Ishikk said Honestly Who paid attention to what hour it was Foreigners Always so busy Grump just shook his head as Maib brought them some soup Her place was the closest thing the village had to an inn She left Ishikk a soft cloth napkin and nice cup of sweet wine trying to balance that fish as quickly as possible Very well Grump said Let us have your report friend Ive been by Fu Ralis Fu Namir Fu Albast and Fu Moorin this month Ishikk said taking a slurp of soup Nobody has seen this man you search for You asked right questions Blunt said You are certain Of course Im certain Ishikk said I have been doing this for ages now Five months Blunt corrected And no results Ishikk shrugged You wish me to make up stories Vun Makak would like me to do that No no stories friend Grump said We want only the truth Well Ive given it to you You swear it by Nu Ralik that god of yours Hush Ishikk said Dont say his name Are you idiots Grump frowned But he is your god Understand Is his name holy Not to be spoken Foreigners were so stupid Of course Nu Ralik was their god but you always pretended that he wasnt Vun Makakhis younger spiteful brotherhad to be tricked into thinking you worshipped him otherwise hed get jealous It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy grotto I swear it by Vun Makak Ishikk said pointedly May he watch over me and curse me as he pleases I have looked diligently No foreigner like this one you mentionwith his white hair clever tongue and arrowlike facehas been seen He dyes his hair sometimes Grump said And wears disguises Ive asked using the names you gave me Ishikk said Nobody has seen him Now perhaps I could find you a fish that could locate him Ishikk rubbed his stubbly chin Ill bet a stumpy cort could do it Might take me a while to find one though The three looked at him There may be something to these fish you know Blunt said Superstition Grump replied You always look for superstition Vao Vao wasnt the mans real name Ishikk was sure they used fake names That was why he used his own names for them If they were going to give him fake names hed give them fake names back And you Temoo Blunt snapped We cant pontificate our way to Gentlemen Thinker said He nodded to Ishikk who was still slurping his soup All three of them switched to another language and continued their argument Ishikk listened with half an ear trying to determine what language it was He never had been good with other kinds of languages Why did he need them Didnt help with fishing or selling fish He had searched for their man He got around a lot visited a lot of places around the Purelake It was one of the reasons why he didnt want to be caught by Maib Hed have to settle down and that wasnt good for catching fish Not the rare ones at least He didnt bother wondering why they were looking for this Hoid whoever he was Foreigners were always looking for things they couldnt have Ishikk sat back dangling his toes in the water That felt good Eventually they finished their argument They gave him some more instructions handed him a pouch of spheres and stepped down into the water Like most foreigners they wore thick boots that came all the way up to their knees They splashed in the water as they walked to the entrance Ishikk followed waving to Maib and picking up his buckets Hed be back later in the day for an evening meal Maybe I should let her catch me he thought stepping back out into the sunlight and sighing in relief Nu Ralik knows Im getting old Might be nice to relax His foreigners splashed down into the Purelake Grump was last He seemed very dissatisfied Where are you Roamer What a fools quest this is Then he added in his own tongue Alavanta kamaloo kayana He splashed after his companions Well youve got the fool part right Ishikk said with a chuckle turning his own direction and heading off to check on his traps Nan Balat liked killing things Not people Never people But animals those he could kill Particularly the little ones He wasnt sure why it made him feel better it simply did He sat on the porch of his mansion pulling the legs off a small crab one at a time There was a satisfying rip to each onehe pulled on it lightly at first and the animal grew stiff Then he pulled harder and it started to squirm The ligament resisted then started ripping followed by a quick pop The crab squirmed some more and Nan Balat held up the leg pinching the beast with two fingers on his other hand He sighed in satisfaction Ripping a leg free soothed him made the aches in his body retreat He tossed the leg over his shoulder and moved on to the next one He didnt like to talk about his habit He didnt even speak of it to Eylita It was just something he did You had to keep your sanity somehow He finished with the legs then stood up leaning on his cane looking out over the Davar gardens which were made up of stonework walls covered with different kinds of vines They were beautiful though Shallan had been the only one who truly appreciated them This area of Jah Kevedto the west and south of Alethkar of higher elevation and broken by mountains such as the Horneater Peakshad a profusion of vines They grew on everything covering the mansion growing over the steps Out in the wilds they hung from trees grew over rocky expanses as ubiquitous as grass was in other areas of Roshar Balat walked to the edge of the porch Some wild songlings began to sing in the distance scraping their ridged shells They each played a different beat and notes though they couldnt really be called melodies Melodies were things of humans not animals But each one was a song and at times they seemed to sing back and forth to one another Balat walked down the steps one at a time the vines shaking and pulling away before his feet fell It had been nearly six months since Shallans departure This morning theyd had word from her via spanreed that shed succeeded in the first part of her plan becoming Jasnah Kholins ward And so his baby sisterwho before this had never left their estateswas preparing to rob the most important woman in the world Walking down the steps was depressingly hard work for him Twentythree years old he thought and already a cripple He still felt a constant latent ache The break had been bad and the surgeon had nearly decided to cut off the entire leg Perhaps he could be thankful that hadnt proven necessary though he would always walk with a cane Scrak was playing with something in the sitting green a place where cultivated grass was grown and kept free of vines The large axehound rolled about gnawing at the object antennae pulled back flat against her skull Scrak Balat said hobbling forward what have you got there girl The axehound looked up at her master antennae cocking upward The hound trumped with two echoing voices overlapping one another then went back to playing Blasted creature Balat thought fondly never would obey properly Hed been breeding axehounds since his youth and had discoveredas had many before himthat the smarter an animal was the more likely it was to disobey Oh Scrak was loyal but shed ignore you on the little things Like a young child trying to prove her independence As he got closer he saw that Scrak had managed to catch a songling The fistsized creature was shaped like a peaked disc with four arms that reached out from the sides and scraped rhythms along the top Four squat legs underneath normally held it to a rock wall though Scrak had chewed those off She had two of the arms off too and had managed to crack the shell Balat almost took it away to pull the other two arms off but decided it was best to let Scrak have her fun Scrak set the songling down and looked up at Balat her antennae rising inquisitively She was sleek and lean six legs extending before her as she sat on her haunches Axehounds didnt have shells or skin instead their body was covered with some fusion of the two smooth to the touch and more pliable than true carapace but harder than skin and made of interlocking sections The axehounds angular face seemed curious her deep black eyes regarding Balat She trumped softly Balat smiled reaching down and scratching behind the axehounds ear holes The animal leaned against himshe probably weighed as much as he did The bigger axehounds came up to a mans waist though Scrak was of a smaller quicker breed The songling quivered and Scrak pounced on it eagerly crunching at its shell with her strong outer mandibles Am I a coward Scrak Balat asked sitting down on a bench He set his cane aside and snatched a small crab that had been hiding on the side of the bench its shell having turned white to match the stone He held up the squirming animal The greens grass had been bred to be less timid and it poked out of its holes only a few moments after he passed Other exotic plants bloomed poking out of shells or holes in the ground and soon patches of red orange and blue waved in the wind around him The area around the axehound remained bare of course Scrak was having far too much fun with her prey and she kept even the cultivated plants hidden in their burrows I couldnt have gone to chase Jasnah Balat said starting to pull the crabs legs off Only a woman could get close enough to her to steal the Soulcaster We decided that Besides someone needs to stay back and care for the needs of the house The excuses were hollow He did feel like a coward He pulled off a few more legs but it was unsatisfying The crab was too small and the legs came off too easily This plan probably wont even work he said taking off the last of the legs Odd looking at a creature like this when it had no legs The crab was still alive Yet how could you know it Without the legs to wiggle the creature seemed as dead as a stone The arms he thought we wave them about to make us seem alive Thats what theyre good for He put his fingers between the halves of the crabs shell and began to pry them apart This at least had a nice feeling of resistance to it They were a broken family Years of suffering their fathers brutal temper had driven Asha Jushu to vice and Tet Wikim to despair Only Balat had escaped unscathed Balat and Shallan Shed been left alone never touched At times Balat had hated her for that but how could you truly hate someone like Shallan Shy quiet delicate I should never have let her go he thought There should have been another way Shed never manage on her own she was probably terrified It was a wonder shed done as much as she had He tossed the pieces of crab over his shoulder If only Helaran had survived Their eldest brotherthen known as Nan Helaran as hed been the first sonhad stood up to their father repeatedly Well he was dead now and so was their father Theyd left behind a family of cripples Balat a voice cried Wikim appeared on the porch The younger man was past his recent bout of melancholy it appeared What Balat said standing Wikim rushed down the steps hurrying up to him vinesthen grasspulling back before him We have a problem How large a problem Pretty big Id say Come on SzethsonsonVallano Truthless of Shinovar sat on the wooden tavern floor lavis beer slowly soaking through his brown trousers Grimy worn and fraying his clothing was far different from the simpleyet elegantwhites he had worn over five years before when hed assassinated the king of Alethkar Head bowed hands in his lap he carried no weapons He hadnt summoned his Shardblade in years and it felt equally long since hed had a bath He did not complain If he looked like a wretch people treated him as a wretch One did not ask a wretch to assassinate people So hell do whatever you say asked one of the mine workers sitting at the table The mans clothing was little better than Szeths covered with so much dirt and dust that it was difficult to tell grimy skin from grimy cloth There were four of them holding ceramic cups The room smelled of mud and sweat The ceiling was low the windowson the leeward side onlymere slots The table was precariously held together with several leather straps as the wood was cracked down the middle TookSzeths current masterset his cup down on the tables tilted side It sagged under the weight of his arm Yeah he sure will Hey kurp look at me Szeth looked up Kurp meant child in the local Bav dialect Szeth was accustomed to such pejorative labels Though he was in his thirtyfifth yearand his seventh year since being named Truthlesshis peoples large round eyes shorter stature and tendency toward baldness led Easterners to claim they looked like children Stand up Took said Szeth did so Jump up and down Szeth complied Pour Tons beer on your head Szeth reached for it Hey Ton said pulling the cup away None of that now Oi aint done with this yet If you were said Took he couldnt right pour it on his head could he Get im to do something else Took Ton griped All right Took pulled out his boot knife and tossed it to Szeth Kurp cut your arm up Took said one of the other men a sniffly man named Amark That aint right you know it Took didnt rescind the order so Szeth complied taking the knife and cutting at the flesh of his arm Blood seeped out around the dirty blade Cut your throat Took said Now Took Amark said standing Oi wont Oh hush you Took said Several groups of men from other tables were watching now Youll see Kurp cut your throat I am forbidden to take my own life Szeth said softly in the Bav language As Truthless it is the nature of my suffering to be forbidden the taste of death by my own hand Amark settled back down looking sheepish Dustmother Ton said he always talks like that Like what Took asked taking a gulp from his mug Smooth words so soft and proper Like a lighteyes Yeah Took said Hes like a slave only better cuz hes a Shin He dont run or talk back or anything Dont have to pay him neither Hes like a parshman but smarter Worth a right many spheres Oid say He eyed the other men Could take him to the mines with you to work and collect his pay Hed do things you dont wan na Muck out the privy whitewash the home All kinds of useful stuff Well howd you come by him then one of the other men asked scratching his chin Took was a transient worker moving from town to town Displaying Szeth was one of the ways he made quick friends Oh now thats a story Took said Oi was traveling in the mountains down south you know and Oi heard this weird howling noise It wasnt joust the wind you know and The tale was a complete fabrication Szeths previous mastera farmer in a nearby villagehad traded Szeth to Took for a sack of seeds The farmer had gotten him from a traveling merchant who had gotten him from a cobbler whod won him in an illegal game of chance There had been dozens before him At first the darkeyed commoners enjoyed the novelty of owning him Slaves were far too expensive for most and parshmen were even more valuable So having someone like Szeth to order around was quite the novelty He cleaned floors sawed wood helped in the fields and carried burdens Some treated him well some did not But they always got rid of him Perhaps they could sense the truth that he was capable of so much more than they dared use him for It was one thing to have a slave of your own But when that slave talked like a lighteyes and knew more than you did It made them uncomfortable Szeth tried to play the part tried to make himself act less refined It was very difficult for him Perhaps impossible What would these men say if they knew that the man who emptied their chamber pot was a Shardbearer and a Surgebinder A Windrunner like the Radiants of old The moment he summoned his Blade his eyes would turn from dark green to palealmost glowingsapphire a unique effect of his particular weapon Best that they never discovered Szeth gloried in being wasted each day he was made to clean or dig instead of kill was a victory That evening five years ago still haunted him Before then he had been ordered to killbut always in secret silently Never before had he been given such deliberately terrible instructions Kill destroy and cut your way to the king Be seen doing it Leave witnesses Wounded but alive and that is when he swore to serve me my entire life Took finished Hes been with me ever since The listening men turned to Szeth It is true he said as hed been ordered earlier Every word of it Took smiled Szeth didnt make him uncomfortable he apparently considered it natural that Szeth obeyed him Perhaps as a result he would remain Szeths master longer than the others Well Took said Oi should be going Need to get an early start tomorrow More places to see more unseen roads to dare He liked to think of himself as a seasoned traveler though as far as Szeth could tell he just moved around in a wide circle There were many small minesand therefore small villagesin this part of Bavland Took had probably been to this same village years back but the mines made for a lot of transient workers It was unlikely hed be remembered unless someone had noted his terribly exaggerated stories Terrible or not the other miners seemed to thirst for more They urged him on offering him another drink and he modestly agreed Szeth sat quietly legs folded hands in his lap blood trickling down his arm Had the Parshendi known what they were consigning him to by tossing his Oathstone away as they fled Kholinar that night Szeth had been required to recover it then stand there beside the road wondering if he would be discovered and executedhoping hed be discovered and executeduntil a passing merchant had cared enough to inquire By then Szeth had stood only in a loincloth His honor had forced him to discard the white clothing as it would have made him easier to recognize He had to preserve himself so that he could suffer After a short explanation that left out incriminating details Szeth had found himself riding in the back of the merchants cart The merchanta man named Avadohad been clever enough to realize that in the wake of the kings death foreigners might be treated poorly Hed made his way to Jah Keved never knowing that he harbored Gavilars murderer as his serving man The Alethi didnt search for him They assumed that he the infamous Assassin in White had retreated with the Parshendi They probably expected to discover him in the middle of the Shattered Plains The miners eventually tired of Tooks increasingly slurred stories They bid him farewell ignoring his broad hints that another cup of beer would prompt him to tell his greatest tale that of the time when hed seen the Nightwatcher herself and stolen a sphere that glowed black at night That tale always discomforted Szeth as it reminded him of the strange black sphere Gavilar had given him Hed hidden that carefully in Jah Keved He didnt know what it was but he didnt want to risk a master taking it from him When nobody offered Took another drink he reluctantly stumbled from his chair and waved Szeth to follow him from the tavern The street was dark outside This town Ironsway had a proper town square several hundred homes and three different taverns That made it practically a metropolis for Bavlandthe small mostlyignored stretch of land just south of the Horneater Peaks The area was technically part of Jah Keved but even its highprince tended to stay away from it Szeth followed his master through the streets toward the poorer district Took was too cheap to pay for a room in the nice or even modest areas of a town Szeth looked over his shoulder wishing that the Second Sisterknown as Nomon to these Easternershad risen to give a little more light Took stumbled drunkenly then fell over in the street Szeth sighed It would not be the first night he carried his master home to his bed He knelt to lift Took He froze A warm liquid was pooling beneath his masters body Only then did he notice the knife in Tooks neck Szeth instantly came alert as a group of footpads slipped out of the alleyway One raised a hand the knife in it reflecting starlight preparing to throw at Szeth He tensed There were infused spheres he could draw upon in Tooks pouch Wait hissed one of the footpads The man with the knife paused Another man came closer inspecting Szeth Hes Shin Wont hurt a cremling Others pulled the corpse into the alleyway The one with the knife raised his weapon again He could still yell Then why hasnt he Oim telling you theyre harmless Almost like parshmen We can sell him Maybe the second said Hes terrified Look at im Come ere the first footpad said waving Szeth forward He obeyed walking into the alley which was suddenly illuminated as the other footpads pulled open Tooks pouch Kelek one of them said hardly worth the effort A handful of chips and two marks not a single broam in the lot Oim telling you the first man said We can sell this fellow as a slave People like Shin servants Hes just a kid Nah They all look like that Hey whacha got there The man plucked a twinkling spheresized chunk of rock from the hand of the man counting the spheres It was fairly ordinary a simple piece of rock with a few quartz crystals set into it and a rusty vein of iron on one side What is this Worthless one of the men said I am required to tell you Szeth said quietly that you are holding my Oathstone So long as you possess it you are my master Whats that one of the footpads said standing The first one closed his hand around the stone shooting a wary glance at the others He looked back at Szeth Your master What does that mean exactly in precise terms and all I must obey you Szeth said In all things though I will not follow an order to kill myself He also couldnt be ordered to give up his Blade but there was no need to mention that at the moment Youll obey me the footpad said You mean youll do what Oi say Yes Anything Oi say Szeth closed his eyes Yes Well aint that something interestin the man said musing Something interestin indeed PRIME MAP OF THE SHATTERED PLAINS In the east one can clearly note the Tower the largest plateau of the area Warcamps are visible in the west Glyphpairs and plateau numbers have been removed to preserve the clarity of this smaller reproduction of the original hanging in His Majesty Elhokars Gallery of Maps Old friend I hope this missive finds you well Though as you are now essentially immortal I would guess that wellness on your part is something of a given Today King Elhokar announced riding beneath the bright open sky is an excellent day to slay a god Wouldnt you say Undoubtedly Your Majesty Sadeass reply was smooth quick and said with a knowing smile One might say that gods as a rule should fear the Alethi nobility Most of us at least Adolin gripped his reins a little more tightly it put him on edge every time Highprince Sadeas spoke Do we have to ride up here at the front Renarin whispered I want to listen Adolin replied softly He and his brother rode near the front of the column near the king and his highprinces Behind them extended a grand procession a thousand soldiers in Kholin blue dozens of servants and even women in palanquins to scribe accounts of the hunt Adolin glanced at them all as he reached for his canteen He was wearing his Shardplate and so he had to be careful when grabbing it lest he crush it Ones muscles reacted with increased speed strength and dexterity when wearing the armor and it took practice to use it correctly Adolin was still occasionally caught by surprise though hed held this suitinherited from his mothers side of the familysince his sixteenth birthday That was now seven years past He turned and took a long drink of lukewarm water Sadeas rode to the kings left and DalinarAdolins fatherwas a solid figure riding at the kings right The final highprince on the hunt was Vamah who wasnt a Shardbearer The king was resplendent in his golden Shardplateof course Plate could make any man look regal Even Sadeas looked impressive when wearing his red Plate though his bulbous face and ruddy complexion weakened the effect Sadeas and the king flaunted their Plate Andwell perhaps Adolin did too Hed had his painted blue a few ornamentations welded onto the helm and pauldrons to give an extra look of danger How could you not show off when wearing something as grand as Shardplate Adolin took another drink listening to the king talk about his excitement for the hunt Only one Shardbearer in the processionindeed only one Shardbearer in the entirety of the ten armiesused no paint or ornamentations on his Plate Dalinar Kholin Adolins father preferred to leave his armor its natural slategrey color Dalinar rode beside the king his face somber He rode with his helm tied to his saddle exposing a square face topped by short black hair that had gone white at the temples Few women had ever called Dalinar Kholin handsome his nose was the wrong shape his features blocky rather than delicate It was the face of a warrior He rode astride a massive black Ryshadium stallion one of the largest horses that Adolin had ever seenand while the king and Sadeas looked regal in their armor somehow Dalinar managed to look like a soldier To him the Plate was not an ornament It was a tool He never seemed to be surprised by the strength or speed the armor lent him It was as if for Dalinar Kholin wearing his Plate was his natural stateit was the times without that were abnormal Perhaps that was one reason hed earned the reputation of being one of the greatest warriors and generals who ever lived Adolin found himself wishing passionately that his father would do a little more these days to live up to that reputation Hes thinking about the visions Adolin thought regarding his fathers distant expression and troubled eyes It happened again last night Adolin said softly to Renarin During the highstorm I know Renarin said His voice was measured controlled He always paused before he replied to a question as if testing the words in his mind Some women Adolin knew said Renarins ways made them feel as if he were dissecting them with his mind Theyd shiver when they spoke of him though Adolin had never found his younger brother the least bit discomforting What do you think they mean Adolin asked speaking quietly so only Renarin could hear Fathersepisodes I dont know Renarin we cant keep ignoring them The soldiers are talking Rumors are spreading through all ten armies Dalinar Kholin was going mad Whenever a highstorm came he fell to the floor and began to shake Then he began raving in gibberish Often hed stand blue eyes delusional and wild swinging and flailing Adolin had to restrain him lest he hurt himself or others He sees things Adolin said Or he thinks he does Adolins grandfather had suffered from delusions When hed grown old hed thought he was back at war Was that what happened to Dalinar Was he reliving youthful battles days when hed earned his renown Or was it that terrible night he saw over and over the night when his brother had been murdered by the Assassin in White And why did he so often mention the Knights Radiant soon after his episodes It all made Adolin feel sick Dalinar was the Blackthorn a genius of the battlefield and a living legend Together he and his brother had reunited Alethkars warring highprinces after centuries of strife He had defeated countless challengers in duels had won dozens of battles The entire kingdom looked up to him And now this What did you do as a son when the man you lovedthe greatest man alivestarted to lose his wits Sadeas was speaking about a recent victory Hed won another gemheart two days back and the kingit appearedhadnt heard of it Adolin tensed at the boasts We should move back Renarin said We are of rank enough to be here Adolin said I dont like how you get when youre around Sadeas We have to keep an eye on the man Renarin Adolin thought He knows Father is weakening Hell try to strike Adolin forced himself to smile however He tried to be relaxed and confident for Renarin Generally that wasnt difficult Hed happily spend his entire life dueling lounging and courting the occasional pretty girl Of late however life didnt seem content to let him enjoy its simple pleasures model of courage lately Sadeas the king was saying Youve done very well in capturing gemhearts You are to be commended Thank you Your Majesty Though the competition grows unexciting as some people dont seem interested in participating I guess even the best weapons eventually grow dull Dalinar who might once have responded to the veiled slur said nothing Adolin gritted his teeth It was flatout unconscionable for Sadeas to be taking shots at his father in his present state Perhaps Adolin should offer the pompous bastard a challenge You didnt duel highprincesit just wasnt done not unless you were ready to make a big storm of it But maybe he was Maybe Adolin Renarin said warningly Adolin looked to the side Hed held out his hand as if to summon his Blade He picked up his reins with the hand instead Storming man he thought Leave my father alone Why dont we talk about the hunt Renarin said As usual the younger Kholin rode with a straight back and perfect posture eyes hidden behind his spectacles a model of propriety and solemnity Arent you excited Bah Adolin said I never find hunts as interesting as everyone says theyre going to be I dont care how big the beast isin the end its really just butchery Now dueling that was exciting The feel of the Shardblade in your hand of facing someone crafty skilled and careful Man against man strength against strength mind against mind Hunting some dumb beast just couldnt compare to that Maybe you should have invited Janala along Renarin said She wouldnt have come Adolin said Not afterwell you know Rilla was very vocal yesterday It was best to just leave You really should have been wiser in your treatment of her Renarin said sounding disapproving Adolin mumbled a noncommittal reply It wasnt his fault that his relationships often burned out quickly Well technically this time it was his fault But it wasnt usually This was just an oddity The king began complaining about something Renarin and Adolin had lagged behind and Adolin couldnt hear what was being said Lets ride up closer Adolin said nudging his mount forward Renarin rolled his eyes but followed Unite them The words whispered in Dalinars mind He couldnt rid himself of them They consumed him as he trotted Gallant across a rocky boulderstrewn plateau on the Shattered Plains Shouldnt we be there by now the king asked Were still two or three plateaus away from the hunting site Your Majesty Dalinar said distracted It will be another hour perhaps observing proper protocols If we had vantage we could probably see the pavilion to Vantage Would that rock formation up ahead do I suppose Dalinar said inspecting the towerlike length of rock We could send scouts to check Scouts Bah I need a run Uncle Ill bet you five full broams that I can beat you to the top And with that the king galloped away in a thunder of hooves leaving behind a shocked group of lighteyes attendants and guards Storm it Dalinar cursed kicking his horse into motion Adolin you have command Secure the next plateau just in case His son who had been lagging behind nodded sharply Dalinar galloped after the king a figure in golden armor and a long blue cape Hoofbeats pounded the stone rock formations whipping past Ahead the steep spikelike spire of rock rose from the lip of the plateau Such formations were common out here on the Shattered Plains Curse that boy Dalinar still thought of Elhokar as a boy though the king was in his twentyseventh year But sometimes he acted like a boy Why couldnt he give more warning before leaping into one of these stunts Still as Dalinar rode he admitted to himself that it did feel good to charge freely helm off face to the wind His pulse picked up as he got into the race and he forgave its impetuous beginning For the moment Dalinar let himself forget his troubles and the words that had been echoing in his head The king wanted a race Well Dalinar would give him one He charged past the king Elhokars stallion was a good breed but it could never match Gallant who was a full Ryshadium two hands taller and much stronger than an ordinary horse The animals chose their own riders and only a dozen men in all of the warcamps were so fortunate Dalinar was one Adolin another In seconds Dalinar reached the formations base He threw himself from the saddle while Gallant was still moving He hit hard but the Shardplate absorbed the impact stone crunching beneath his metal boots as he skidded to a stop Men who hadnt ever worn Plateparticularly those who were accustomed to its inferior cousin simple plate and mailcould never understand Shardplate wasnt merely armor It was so much more He ran to the bottom of the rock formation as Elhokar galloped up behind Dalinar leapedPlateassisted legs propelling him up some eight feetand grabbed a handhold in the stone With a heave he pulled himself up the Plate lending him the strength of many men The Thrill of contest began to rise within him It wasnt nearly as keen as the Thrill of battle but it was a worthy substitute Rock scraped below Elhokar had begun to climb as well Dalinar didnt look down He kept his eyes fixed on the small natural platform at the top of the fortyfoothigh formation He groped with steelcovered fingers finding another handhold The gauntlets covered his hands but the ancient armor somehow transferred sensation to his fingers It was as if he were wearing thin leather gloves A scraping sound came from the right accompanied by a voice cursing softly Elhokar had taken a different path hoping to pass Dalinar but the king had found himself at a section without handholds above His progress was stalled The kings golden Shardplate glittered as he glanced at Dalinar Elhokar set his jaw and looked upward then launched himself in a powerful leap toward an outcropping Fool boy Dalinar thought watching the king seem to hang in the air for a moment before he snatched the projecting rock and dangled Then the king pulled himself up and continued to climb Dalinar moved furiously stone grinding beneath his metal fingertips chips falling free The wind ruffled his cape He heaved strained and pushed himself managing to get just ahead of the king The top was mere feet away The Thrill sang at him He reached for the goal determined to win He couldnt lose He had to Unite them He hesitated not quite certain why and let his nephew get ahead Elhokar hauled himself to his feet atop the rock formation then laughed in triumph He turned toward Dalinar holding out a hand Stormwinds Uncle but you made a fine race of it At the end there I thought for sure you had me The triumph and joy in Elhokars face brought a smile to Dalinars lips The younger man needed victories these days Even little ones would do him good Glorysprenlike tiny golden translucent globes of lightbegan to pop into existence around him attracted by his sense of accomplishment Blessing himself for hesitating Dalinar took the kings hand letting Elhokar pull him up There was just enough room on top of the natural tower for them both Breathing deeply Dalinar slapped the king on the back with a clank of metal on metal That was a fine contest Your Majesty And you played it very well The king beamed His golden Shardplate gleamed in the noonday sun he had his faceplate up revealing light yellow eyes a strong nose and a cleanshaven face that was almost too handsome with its full lips broad forehead and firm chin Gavilar had looked like that too before hed suffered a broken nose and that terrible scar on his chin Below them the Cobalt Guard and some of Elhokars attendants rode up including Sadeas His Plate gleamed red though he wasnt a full Shardbearerhe had only the Plate not the Blade Dalinar looked up From this height he could scan a large swath of the Shattered Plains and he had an odd moment of familiarity He felt as if hed been atop this vantage point before looking down at a broken landscape The moment was gone in a heartbeat There Elhokar said pointing with a golden gauntleted hand I can see our destination Dalinar shaded his eyes picking out a large cloth pavilion three plateaus away flying the kings flag Wide permanent bridges led there they were relatively close to the Alethi side of the Shattered Plains on plateaus Dalinar himself maintained A fully grown chasmfiend living here was his to hunt the wealth at its heart his privilege to claim You were correct again Uncle Elhokar said I try to make a habit of it I cant blame you for that I suppose Though I can beat you at a race now and then Dalinar smiled I felt like a youth again chasing after your father on some ridiculous challenge Elhokars lips tightened to a thin line and the gloryspren faded away Mentioning Gavilar soured him he felt others compared him unfavorably to the old king Unfortunately he was often right Dalinar moved on quickly We must have seemed of the ten fools charging away like that I do wish youd given me more notice to prepare your honor guard This is a war zone Bah You worry too much Uncle The Parshendi havent attacked this close to our side of the Plains in years Well you seemed worried about your safety two nights ago Elhokar sighed audibly How many times must I explain this to you Uncle I can face enemy soldiers with Blade in hand Its what they might send when were not looking when all is dark and quiet that you should be trying to protect me from Dalinar didnt reply Elhokars nervousnessparanoia evenregarding assassination was strong But who could blame him considering what had happened to his father Im sorry brother he thought as he did every time he thought of the night when Gavilar had died Alone without his brother to protect him I looked into the matter you asked me about Dalinar said forcing away bad memories You did What did you discover Not much Im afraid There were no traces of trespassers on your balcony and none of the servants reported any strangers in the area There was someone watching me in the darkness that night If so they havent returned Your Majesty And they left no clues behind Elhokar seemed dissatisfied and the silence between them grew stark Below Adolin met with scouts and prepared for the troop crossing Elhokar had protested at how many men Dalinar had brought Most of them wouldnt be needed on the huntthe Shardbearers not the soldiers would slay the beast But Dalinar would see his nephew protected Parshendi raids had grown less bold during the years of fightingAlethi scribes guessed their numbers were a quarter their prior strength though it was difficult to judgebut the kings presence might be enough to entice them into a reckless attack The winds blew across Dalinar returning with them that faint familiarity hed felt a few minutes before Standing atop a peak looking out at desolation A sense of an awful and amazing perspective Thats it he thought I did stand atop a formation like this It happened during During one of his visions The very first one You must unite them the strange booming words had told him You must prepare Build of your people a fortress of strength and peace a wall to resist the winds Cease squabbling and unite The Everstorm comes Your Majesty Dalinar found himself saying I He trailed off as quickly as he began What could he say That hed been seeing visions Thatin defiance of all doctrine and common sensehe thought those visions might be from the Almighty That he thought they should withdraw from the battlefield and go back to Alethkar Pure foolishness Uncle the king asked What do you want Nothing Come lets get back to the others Adolin twisted one of his hogshide reins around his finger while he sat astride his horse awaiting the next batch of scout reports Hed managed to get his mind off his father and Sadeas and was instead contemplating just how he was going to explain his falling out with Rilla in a way that would earn him some sympathy with Janala Janala loved ancient epic poems could he phrase the falling out in dramatic terms He smiled thinking of her luxurious black hair and sly smile Shed been daring teasing at him while he was known to be courting someone else He could use that too Maybe Renarin was right perhaps he should have invited her on the hunt The prospect of fighting a greatshell would have been far more interesting to him if someone beautiful and longhaired were watching New scout reports are in Brightlord Adolin Tarilar said jogging up Adolin turned his mind back to business Hed taken up position with some members of the Cobalt Guard beside the base of the high rock formation where his father and the king were still conversing Tarilar scoutlord was a gauntfaced man with a thick chest and arms From some angles his head looked so relatively small on his body that it appeared to have been smashed Proceed Adolin said Advance runners have met with the lead huntmaster and have returned There are no sightings of Parshendi on any nearby plateaus Companies Eighteen and Twentyone are in position though there are still eight companies to go Adolin nodded Have Company Twentyone send some outriders to watch from plateaus fourteen and sixteen And two each on plateaus six and eight Six and eight Behind us If I were going to ambush the party Adolin said Id round back this way and cut us off from fleeing Do it Tarilar saluted Yes Brightlord He hurried away to pass the orders You really think thats necessary Renarin asked riding up beside Adolin No But Father will want it done anyway You know he will There was motion up above Adolin looked up just in time to see the king leap off the rock formation cape streaming behind him as he fell some forty feet to the rock floor Adolins father stood at the lip above and Adolin could imagine him cursing to himself at what he saw as a foolhardy move Shardplate could withstand a fall that far but it was high enough to be dangerous Elhokar landed with an audible crack throwing up chips of stone and a large puff of Stormlight He managed to stay upright Adolins father took a safer way down descending to a lower ledge before jumping He seems to take the safer pathway more and more often lately Adolin thought idly And he often seems to find reasons to give me command as well Thoughtful Adolin trotted his horse out of the shadow of the rock formation He needed to get a report from the rear guardhis father would want to hear it His path took him past a group of lighteyes from Sadeass party The king Sadeas and Vamah each had a collection of attendants aides and sycophants accompanying them Looking at them riding in their comfortable silks openfronted jackets and shadecovered palanquins made Adolin aware of his sweaty bulky armor Shardplate was wonderful and empowering but beneath a hot sun it could still leave a man wishing for something less confining But of course he couldnt have worn casual clothing like the others Adolin was to be in uniform even on a hunt The Alethi War Codes commanded it Never mind that nobody had followed those Codes in centuries Or at least nobody but Dalinar Kholinand by extension his sons Adolin passed a pair of lounging lighteyes Vartian and Lomard two of Sadeass recent hangerson They were talking loudly enough that Adolin could hear Probably on purpose Chasing after the king again Vartian said shaking his head Like pet axehounds nipping at their masters heels Shameful Lomard said How long has it been since Dalinar won a gemheart The only time he can get one is when the king lets them hunt it without competition Adolin set his jaw and rode on His fathers interpretation of the Codes wouldnt let Adolin challenge a man to a duel while he was on duty or in command He chafed at the needless restrictions but Dalinar had spoken as Adolins commanding officer That meant there was no room for argument Hed have to find a way to duel the two idiot sycophants in another setting put them in their places Unfortunately he couldnt duel everyone who spoke out against his father The biggest problem was the things they said had some real truth to them The Alethi princedoms were like kingdoms unto themselves still mostly autonomous despite having accepted Gavilar as king Elhokar had inherited the throne and Dalinar by right had taken the Kholin Princedom as his own However most of the highprinces gave only token nods to the paramount rule of the king That left Elhokar without land that was specifically his own He tended to act like a highprince of the Kholin Princedom taking great interest in its daytoday management So while Dalinar should have been a ruler unto himself he instead bent to Elhokars whims and dedicated his resources to protecting his nephew That made him weak in the eyes of the othersnothing more than a glorified bodyguard Once when Dalinar had been feared men had not dared whisper about these things But now Dalinar went on fewer and fewer plateau assaults and his forces lagged behind in capturing precious gemhearts While the others fought and won Dalinar and his sons spent their time in bureaucratic administration Adolin wanted to be out there fighting killing Parshendi What was the good of following the Codes of War when he rarely got to go to war Its the fault of those delusions Dalinar wasnt weak and he certainly wasnt a coward no matter what people said He was just troubled The rearguard captains werent formed up yet so Adolin decided to give the king a report instead He trotted up toward the kingjoining Sadeas who was doing the same Not unexpectedly Sadeas frowned at him The highprince hated that Adolin had a Blade while Sadeas had none he had coveted one for years now Adolin met the highprinces eyes smiling Anytime you want to duel me for my Blade Sadeas go ahead and try What Adolin wouldnt do to get that eel of a man in the dueling ring When Dalinar and the king rode up and Adolin spoke quickly before Sadeas could speak Your Majesty I have scout reports The king sighed More of nothing I expect Honestly Uncle must we have a report on every little detail of the army We are at war Your Majesty Dalinar said Elhokar sighed sufferingly Youre a strange man cousin Adolin thought Elhokar saw murderers in every shadow yet often dismissed the Parshendi threat Hed go charging off like he had today with no honor guard and would leap off a fortyfoottall rock formation Yet hed stay up nights terrified of assassination Give your report son Dalinar said Adolin hesitated now feeling foolish at the lack of substance to what he had to say The scouts have seen no sign of the Parshendi Theyve met with the huntmaster Two companies have secured the next plateau and the other eight will need some time to cross Were close though Yes we saw from above Elhokar said Perhaps a few of us could ride ahead Your Majesty Dalinar said The point of bringing my troops along would be somewhat undermined if you left them behind Elhokar rolled his eyes Dalinar did not yield his expression as immobile as the rocks around them Seeing him like thatfirm unyielding before a challengemade Adolin smile with pride Why couldnt he be like this all of the time Why did he back down so often before insults or challenges Very well the king said Well take a break and wait while the army crosses The kings attendants responded immediately men climbing off horses women having their palanquin bearers set them down Adolin moved off to get that rearguard report By the time he returned Elhokar was practically holding court His servants had set up a small awning to give him shade and others served wine Chilled using one of the new fabrials that could make things cold Adolin removed his helm and wiped his brow with his saddle rag again wishing he could join the others and enjoy a little wine Instead he climbed down from his horse and went looking for his father Dalinar stood outside the awning gauntleted hands clasped behind his back looking eastward toward the Originthe distant the unseen place where highstorms began Renarin stood at his side looking out as well as if trying to see what it was that his father found so interesting Adolin rested a hand on his brothers shoulder and Renarin smiled at him Adolin knew that his brothernow nineteen years oldfelt out of place Though he wore a side sword he barely knew how to use it His blood weakness made it difficult for him to spend any reasonable amount of time practicing Father Adolin said Maybe the king was right Perhaps we should have moved on quickly Id rather have this entire hunt over with Dalinar looked at him When I was your age I looked forward to a hunt like this Taking down a greatshell was the highlight of a young mans year Not this again Adolin thought Why was everyone so offended that he didnt find hunts exciting Its just an oversized chull Father These oversized chulls grow to fifty feet tall and are capable of crushing even a man in Shardplate Yes Adolin said and so well bait it for hours while baking in the hot sun If it decides to show up well pelt it with arrows only closing in once its so weak it can barely resist as we hack it to death with Shardblades Very honorable Its not a duel Dalinar said its a hunt A grand tradition Adolin raised an eyebrow at him And yes Dalinar added It can be tedious But the king was insistent Youre just still smarting over the problems with Rilla Adolin Renarin said You were eager a week ago You really should have invited Janala Janala hates hunts Thinks theyre barbarous Dalinar frowned Janala Whos Janala Daughter of Brightlord Lustow Adolin said And youre courting her Not yet but Ive sure been trying What happened to that other girl The short one with the fondness for silver hair ribbons Deeli Adolin said Father I stopped courting her over two months back You did Yes Dalinar rubbed his chin There have been two between her and Janala Father Adolin noted You really need to pay more attention Almighty help any man who tries to keep track of your tangled courtships son The most recent was Rilla Renarin said Dalinar frowned And you two Had some problems yesterday Adolin said He coughed determined to change the subject Anyway dont you find it odd that the king would insist on coming to hunt the chasmfiend himself Not particularly It isnt often that a fullsized one makes its way out here and the king rarely gets to go on plateau runs This is a way for him to fight But hes so paranoid Why does he now want to go and hunt exposing himself on the Plains Dalinar looked toward the kings awning I know he seems odd son But the king is more complex a man than many give him credit for being He worries that his subjects see him as a coward because of how much he fears assassins and so he finds ways to prove his courage Foolish ways sometimesbut hes not the first man Ive known who will face battle without fear yet cower in terror about knives in the shadows The hallmark of insecurity is bravado The king is learning to lead He needs this hunt He needs to prove to himself and to others that hes still strong and worthy to command a kingdom at war Thats why I encouraged him A successful hunt under controlled circumstances could bolster his reputation and his confidence Adolin slowly closed his mouth his fathers words cutting down his complaints Strange how much the kings actions made sense when explained that way Adolin looked up at his father How can the others whisper that hes a coward Cant they see his wisdom Yes Dalinar said eyes growing distant Your nephew is a better man than many think him and a stronger king At least he could be I just have to figure out how to persuade him to leave the Shattered Plains Adolin started What I didnt understand at first Dalinar continued Unite them Im supposed to unite them But arent they already united We fight together here on the Shattered Plains We have a common enemy in the Parshendi Im beginning to see that were united only in name The highprinces give lip service to Elhokar but this warthis siegeis a game to them A competition against one another We cant unite them here We need to return to Alethkar and stabilize our homeland learn how to work together as one nation The Shattered Plains divide us The others worry too much about winning wealth and prestige Wealth and prestige are what being Alethi is about Father Adolin said Was he really hearing this What of the Vengeance Pact The highprinces vowed to seek retribution upon the Parshendi And we have sought it Dalinar looked to Adolin I realize that it sounds terrible son but some things are more important than vengeance I loved Gavilar I miss him fiercely and I hate the Parshendi for what they did But Gavilars life work was to unite Alethkar and Ill go to Damnation before I let it break apart Father Adolin said feeling pained if theres something wrong here its that were not trying hard enough You think the highprinces are playing games Well show them the way it should be done Instead of talking of retreat we should be talking of advancing striking at the Parshendi instead of besieging them Perhaps Either way we can not speak of withdrawing Adolin said The men already talked of Dalinar losing his spine What would they say if they got hold of this You havent brought this up with the king have you Not yet I havent found the right way Please Dont talk to him about it We shall see Dalinar turned back toward the Shattered Plains his eyes growing distant again Father Youve made your point son and Ive replied to it Do not press the issue Have you gotten the report from the rear guard Yes What of the vanguard I just checked with them and He trailed off Blast It had been long enough that it was probably time to move the kings party onward The last of the army couldnt leave this plateau until the king was safely on the other side Adolin sighed and went off to collect the report Before long they were all across the chasm and riding over the next plateau Renarin trotted up to Adolin and tried to engage him in conversation but Adolin gave only halfhearted replies He was beginning to feel an odd longing Most of the older men in the armyeven those only a few years older than Adolinhad fought alongside his father during the glory days Adolin found himself jealous of all of those men who had known his father and had seen him fight when he hadnt been so wrapped up in the Codes The changes in Dalinar had begun with the death of his brother That terrible day was when everything had started to go wrong The loss of Gavilar had nearly crushed Dalinar and Adolin would never forgive the Parshendi for bringing his father such pain Never Men fought on the Plains for different reasons but this was why Adolin had come Perhaps if they beat the Parshendi his father would go back to the man he had been Perhaps those ghostly delusions that haunted him would vanish Ahead Dalinar was speaking quietly with Sadeas Both men wore frowns They barely tolerated one another though they had once been friends That had also changed the night of Gavilars death What had happened between them The day wore on and they eventually arrived at the hunt sitea pair of plateaus one where the creature would be lured up to attack and another one a safe distance away for those who would watch Like most others these plateaus had an uneven surface inhabited by hardy plants adapted to regular storm exposure Rocky shelves depressions and uneven footing made fighting on them treacherous Adolin joined his father who waited beside the final bridge as the king moved over onto the viewing plateau followed by a company of soldiers The attendants would be next Youre doing well with your command son Dalinar said nodding to a group of soldiers at they passed and saluted Theyre good men Father They hardly need someone to command them during a march from plateau to plateau Yes Dalinar said But you need experience leading and they need to learn to see you as a commander Renarin trotted up to them on his horse it was probably time to cross to the viewing plateau Dalinar nodded for his sons to go first Adolin turned to go but hesitated as he noticed something on the plateau behind them A rider moving quickly to catch up with the hunting party coming from the direction of the warcamps Father Adolin said pointing Dalinar turned immediately following the gesture However Adolin soon recognized the newcomer Not a messenger as hed expected Wit Adolin called waving The newcomer trotted up to them Tall and thin the Kings Wit rode easily on a black gelding He wore a stiff black coat and black trousers a color matched by his deep onyx hair Though he wore a long thin sword tied to his waist as far as Adolin knew the man had never drawn it A dueling foil rather than a military blade it was mostly symbolic Wit nodded to them as he approached wearing one of those keen smiles of his He had blue eyes but he wasnt really a lighteyes Nor was he a darkeyes He waswell he was the Kings Wit That was a category all its own Ah young Prince Adolin Wit exclaimed You actually managed to pry yourself away from the camps young women long enough to join this hunt Im impressed Adolin chuckled uncomfortably Well thats been a topic of some discussion lately Wit raised an eyebrow Adolin sighed Wit would find out eventually anywayit was virtually impossible to keep anything from the man I made a lunch appointment with one woman yesterday but I waswell I was courting another And shes the jealous type So now neither will speak with me Its a constant source of amazement that you get yourself into such messes Adolin Each one is more exciting than the previous Er yes Exciting Thats exactly how it feels Wit laughed again though he maintained a sense of dignity in his posture The Kings Wit was not a silly court fool such as one might find in other kingdoms He was a sword a tool maintained by the king Insulting others was beneath the dignity of the king so just as one used gloves when forced to handle something vile the king retained a Wit so he didnt have to debase himself to the level of rudeness or offensiveness This new Wit had been with them for some months and there was somethingdifferent about him He seemed to know things that he shouldnt important things Useful things Wit nodded to Dalinar Your Lordship Wit Dalinar said stiffly And young Prince Renarin Renarin kept his eyes down No greeting for me Renarin Wit said amused Renarin said nothing He thinks youll mock him if he speaks to you Wit Adolin said Earlier this morning he told me hed determined not to say anything around you Wonderful Wit exclaimed Then I can say whatever I wish and hell not object Renarin hesitated Wit leaned in to Adolin Have I told you about the night Prince Renarin and I had two days back walking the streets of the warcamp We came across these two sisters you see blue eyed and Thats a lie Renarin said blushing Very well Wit said without missing a beat Ill confess there were actually three sisters but Prince Renarin quite unfairly ended up with two of them and I didnt wish to diminish my reputation by Wit Dalinar was stern as he cut in The blackclad man looked to him Perhaps you should restrict your mockery to those who deserve it Brightlord Dalinar I believe that was what I was doing Dalinars frown deepened He never had liked Wit and picking on Renarin was a sure way to raise his ire Adolin could understand that but Wit was almost always goodnatured with Renarin Wit moved to leave passing Dalinar as he did Adolin could barely overhear what was said as Wit leaned over to whisper something Those who deserve my mockery are those who can benefit from it Brightlord Dalinar That one is less fragile than you think him He winked then turned his horse to move on over the bridge Stormwinds but I like that man Adolin said Best Wit weve had in ages I find him unnerving Renarin said softly Thats half the fun Dalinar said nothing The three of them crossed the bridge passing Wit who had stopped to torment a group of officerslighteyes of low enough rank that they needed to serve in the army and earn a wage Several of them laughed while Wit poked fun at another The three of them joined the king and were immediately approached by the days huntmaster Bashin was a short man with a sizable paunch he wore rugged clothing with a leather overcoat and a widebrimmed hat He was a darkeyes of the first nahn the highest and most prestigious rank a darkeyes could have worthy even of marrying into a lighteyed family Bashin bowed to the king Your Majesty Wonderful timing Weve just tossed down the bait Excellent Elhokar said climbing from the saddle Adolin and Dalinar did likewise Shardplate clinking softly Dalinar untying his helm from the saddle How long will it take Two or three hours is likely Bashin said taking the reins of the kings horse Grooms took the two Ryshadium Weve set up over there Bashin pointed toward the hunting plateau the smaller plateau where the actual fighting would take place away from the attendants and the bulk of the soldiers A group of hunters led a lumbering chull around its perimeter towing a rope draped over the side of the cliff That rope would be dragging the bait Were using hog carcasses Bashin explained And we poured hogs blood over the sides The chasmfiend has been spotted by patrols here a good dozen times Hes got his nest nearby for certainhes not here to pupate Hes too big for that and hes remained in the area too long So it should be a fine hunt Once he arrives well loose a group of wild hogs as distractions and you can begin weakening him with arrows They had brought grandbows large steel bows with thick strings and such a high draw weight that only a Shardbearer could use them to fire shafts as thick as three fingers They were recent creations devised by Alethi engineers through the use of fabrial science and each required a small infused gemstone to maintain the strength of its pull without warping the metal Adolins aunt Navanithe widow of King Gavilar mother of Elhokar and his sister Jasnahhad led the research to develop the bows It would be nice if she hadnt left Adolin thought idly Navani was an interesting woman Things were never boring around her Some had started calling the bows Shardbows but Adolin didnt like the term Shardblades and Shardplate were something special Relics from another time a time when the Radiants had walked Roshar No amount of fabrial science had even approached recreating them Bashin led the king and his highprinces toward a pavilion at the center of the viewing plateau Adolin joined his father intending to give a report on the crossing About half of the soldiers were in place but many of the attendants were still making their way across the large permanent bridge onto the viewing plateau The kings banner flapped above the pavilion and a small refreshment station had been erected A soldier at the back was setting up the rack of four grandbows They were sleek and dangerouslooking with thick black shafts in four quivers beside them I think youll have a fine day for the hunt Bashin said to Dalinar Judging by reports the beast is a big one Larger than youve ever slain before Brightlord Gavilar always wanted to slay one of these Dalinar said wistfully He loved greatshell hunts though he never got a chasmfiend Odd that Ive now killed so many The chull pulling the bait bleated in the distance You need to go for the legs on this one Brightlords Bashin said Prehunt advice was one of Bashins responsibilities and he took those seriously Chasmfiends well youre used to attacking them in their chrysalises Dont forget how mean they are when theyre not pupating With one this big use a distraction and come in from He trailed off then groaned cursing softly Storms take that animal I swear the man who trained it must have been daft He was looking across at the next plateau Adolin followed his glance The crablike chull that had been towing the bait was lumbering away from the chasm with a slow yet determined gait Its handlers were yelling running after it Im sorry Brightlord Bashin said Its been doing this all day The chull bleated in a gravelly voice Something seemed wrong to Adolin We can send for another one Elhokar said It shouldnt take too long to Bashin Dalinar said his voice suddenly alarmed Shouldnt there be bait on the end of that beasts rope The huntmaster froze The rope the chull was towing was frayed at the end Something darksomething mindnumbingly enormousrose out of the chasm on thick chitinous legs It climbed onto the plateaunot the small plateau where the hunt was supposed to take place but the viewing plateau where Dalinar and Adolin stood The plateau filled with attendants unarmed guests female scribes and unprepared soldiers Aw Damnation Bashin said I realize that you are probably still angry That is pleasant to know Much as your perpetual health I have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me It is one of the cosmeres great constants I should think Ten heartbeats One That was how long it took to summon a Shardblade If Dalinars heart was racing the time was shorter If he was relaxed it took longer Two On the battlefield the passing of those beats could stretch like an eternity He pulled his helm on as he ran Three The chasmfiend slammed an arm down smashing the bridge filled with attendants and soldiers People screamed plunging into the chasm Dalinar dashed forward on Plateenhanced legs following the king Four The chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the color of dark violet ink Dalinar could see why the Parshendi called these things gods It had a twisted arrowheadlike face with a mouth full of barbed mandibles While it was vaguely crustacean this was no bulky placid chull It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders each claw the size of a horse and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of the plateau Five Chitin made a grinding noise against stone as the creature finished pulling itself onto the plateau snatching a cartpulling chull with a swift claw Six To arms to arms Elhokar bellowed ahead of Dalinar Archers fire Seven Distract it from the unarmed Dalinar bellowed at his soldiers The creature cracked the chulls shellplattersize fragments clattering to the plateauthen stuffed the beast into its maw and began looking down at the fleeing scribes and attendants The chull stopped bleating as the monster crunched down Eight Dalinar leaped a rocky shelf and sailed five yards before slamming into the ground throwing up chips of rock Nine The chasmfiend bellowed with an awful screeching sound It trumpeted with four voices overlapping one another Archers drew Elhokar yelled orders just in front of Dalinar his blue cape flapping Dalinars hand tingled with anticipation Ten His ShardbladeOathbringerformed in his hand coalescing from mist appearing as the tenth beat of his heart thudded in his chest Six feet long from tip to hilt the Blade would have been unwieldy in the hands of any man not wearing Shardplate To Dalinar it felt perfect Hed carried Oathbringer since his youth Bonding to it when he was twenty Weepings old It was long and slightly curved a handspan wide with wavelike serrations near the hilt It curved at the tip like a fishermans hook and was wet with cold dew This sword was a part of him He could sense energy racing along its blade as if it were eager A man never really knew life itself until he charged into battle with Plate and Blade Make it angry Elhokar bellowed his ShardbladeSunraiserspringing from mist into his hand It was long and thin with a large crossguard and was etched up the sides with the ten fundamental glyphs He didnt want the monster to escape Dalinar could hear it in his voice Dalinar was more worried about the soldiers and attendants this hunt had already turned terribly wrong Perhaps they should distract the monster long enough for everyone to escape then pull back and let it dine on chulls and hogs The creature screamed its multivoiced wail again slamming a claw down among the soldiers Men screamed bones splintered and bodies crumpled Archers loosed aiming for the head A hundred shafts zipped into the air but only a few hit the soft muscle between plates of chitin Behind them Sadeas was calling for his grandbow Dalinar couldnt wait for thatthe creature was here dangerous killing his men The bow would be too slow This was a job for the Blade Adolin charged past riding Sureblood The lad had gone racing for his horse rather than charging like Elhokar had Dalinar himself had been forced to stay with the king The other horseseven the warhorsespanicked but Adolins white Ryshadium stallion held steady In a moment Gallant was there trotting beside Dalinar Dalinar grabbed the reins and heaved himself into the air with Plateenhanced legs jumping up into the saddle The force of his landing might have strained the back of a regular horse but Gallant was made of stronger stone than that Elhokar closed his helm the sides misting Hold back Your Majesty Dalinar called riding past Wait until Adolin and I weaken it Dalinar reached up slamming down his own visor The sides misted locking it into place and the sides of the helm became translucent to him You still needed the eye slitlooking through the sides was like looking through dirty glassbut the translucence was one of the most wonderful parts of Shardplate Dalinar rode into the monsters shadow Soldiers scrambled about clutching spears They hadnt been trained to fight thirtyfoottall beasts and it was a testament to their valor that they formed up anyway trying to draw attention away from the archers and the fleeing attendants Arrows rained down bouncing off the carapace and becoming more deadly to the troops below than they were to the chasmfiend Dalinar raised his free arm to shade his eye slit as an arrow clanged off his helm Adolin fell back as the beast swung at a batch of archers crushing them with one of its claws Ill take left Adolin yelled voice muffled by his helm Dalinar nodded cutting to the right galloping past a group of dazed soldiers and into sunlight again as the chasmfiend raised a foreclaw for another sweep Dalinar raced under the limb transferring Oathbringer to his left hand and holding the sword out to the side slashing it through one of the chasmfiends trunklike legs The Blade sheared the thick chitin with barely a tug of resistance As always it didnt cut living flesh though it killed the leg as surely as if it had been cut free The large limb slipped falling numb and useless The monster roared with its deep overlapping trumpeting voices On the other side Dalinar could make out Adolin slicing at a leg The creature shook turning toward Dalinar The two legs that had been cut dragged lifelessly The monster was long and narrow like a crayfish and had a flattened tail It walked on fourteen legs How many could it lose before collapsing Dalinar rounded Gallant meeting up with Adolin whose blue Shardplate was gleaming cape streaming behind him They switched sides as they turned in wide arcs each heading for another leg Meet your enemy monster Elhokar bellowed Dalinar turned The king had found his mount and had managed to get it under control Vengeance wasnt a Ryshadium but the animal was of the best Shin stock Astride the animal Elhokar charged Blade held above his head Well there was no forbidding him the fight He should be all right in his Plate so long as he kept moving The legs Elhokar Dalinar shouted Elhokar ignored him charging directly for the beasts chest Dalinar cursed heeling Gallant as the monster swung Elhokar turned at the last moment leaning low ducking under the blow The chasmfiends claw hit stone with a cracking sound It roared in anger at missing Elhokar the sound echoing through the chasms The king veered toward Dalinar riding past him in a rush Im distracting it you fool Keep attacking I have the Ryshadium Dalinar yelled back at him Ill distractIm faster Elhokar ignored him again Dalinar sighed Elhokar characteristically could not be contained Arguing would only cost more time and more lives so Dalinar did as hed been told He rounded to the side for another approach Gallants hooves beating against the stone ground The king drew the monsters direct attention and Dalinar was able to ride in and slam his Blade through another leg The beast emitted four overlapping screams and turned toward Dalinar But as it did Adolin rode past on the other side cutting at another leg with a deft strike The leg slumped and arrows rained down as archers continued to fire The creature shook confused by the attacks coming from every side It was getting weak and Dalinar raised his arm gesturing The command ordered the rest of the foot soldiers to retreat toward the pavilion Orders given he slipped in and killed another leg That meant five down Perhaps it was time to let the beast limp away killing it now wasnt worth risking lives He called to the king who rodeBlade held out to the sidea short distance away The king glanced at him but obviously didnt hear As the chasmfiend loomed in the background Elhokar wheeled Vengeance in a sharp right turn toward Dalinar There was a soft snap and suddenly the kingand his saddlewent tumbling through the air The horses quick turn had caused the saddle girth to break A man in Shardplate was heavy and put a great strain on both his mount and saddle Dalinar felt a spike of fear and he reined in Gallant Elhokar slammed to the ground dropping his Shardblade The weapon reverted to mist vanishing It was a protection from keeping a Blade from being taken by your enemies they vanished unless you willed them to stay when releasing them Elhokar Dalinar bellowed The king rolled cape wrapping around his body then came to rest He lay dazed for a moment the armor was cracked on one shoulder leaking Stormlight The Plate would have cushioned the fall Hed be all right Unless A claw loomed above the king Dalinar felt a moment of panic turning Gallant to charge toward the king He was going to be too slow The beast would An enormous arrow slammed into the chasmfiends head cracking chitin Purple gore spurted free causing the beast to trump in agony Dalinar twisted in the saddle Sadeas stood in his red Plate taking another massive arrow from an attendant He drew launching the thick bolt into the chasmfiends shoulder with a sharp crack Dalinar raised Oathbringer in salute Sadeas acknowledged raising his bow They were not friends and they did not like one another But they would protect the king That was the bond that united them Get to safety Dalinar yelled to the king as he charged past Elhokar stumbled to his feet and nodded Dalinar moved in He had to distract the beast long enough for Elhokar to get away More of Sadeass arrows flew true but the monster started to ignore them Its sluggishness vanished and its bleats became angry wild crazed It was growing truly enraged This was the most dangerous part there would be no retreating now It would follow them until it either killed them or was slain A claw smashed to the ground just beside Gallant throwing chips of stone into the air Dalinar hunkered low careful to keep his Shardblade out and he cut free another leg Adolin had done the same on the other side Seven legs down half of them How long before the beast dropped Normally at this stage they had launched several dozen arrows into the animal It was difficult to guess what one would do without that prior softeningbeside that hed never fought one this large before He turned Gallant trying to draw the creatures attention Hopefully Elhokar had Are you a god Elhokar bellowed Dalinar groaned looking over his shoulder The king had not fled He strode toward the beast hand to the side I defy you creature Elhokar screamed I claim your life They will see their gods crushed just as they will see their king dead at my feet I defy you Damnations own fool Dalinar thought rounding Gallant Elhokars Shardblade reformed in his hands and he charged toward the monsters chest his cracked shoulder leaking Stormlight He got close and swung at the beasts torso cutting free a piece of chitinlike a persons hair or nails it could be cut by a Blade Then Elhokar slammed his weapon into the monsters breast seeking its heart The beast roared and shook knocking Elhokar free The king barely kept hold of his Blade The beast spun That movement unfortunately brought its tail at Dalinar He cursed yanking Gallant in a tight turn but the tail came too quickly It slammed into Gallant and in a heartbeat Dalinar found himself rolling Oathbringer tumbling from his fingers and slicing a gash in the stone ground before puffing to mist Father a distant voice yelled Dalinar came to rest on the stones dizzy He raised his head to see Gallant stumbling to his feet Blessedly the horse hadnt broken a leg though the animal bled from scrapes and was favoring one leg Away Dalinar said The command word would send the horse to safety Unlike Elhokar it would obey Dalinar climbed to his feet unsteady A scraping sound came from his left and Dalinar spun just in time for the chasmfiends tail to take him in the chest tossing him backward Again the world lurched and metal hit stone in a cacophony as he slid No he thought getting a gauntleted hand beneath himself and heaving using the momentum of his slide to throw himself upright As the sky spun something seemed to right as if the Plate itself knew which way was up He landedstill moving feet grinding on stone He got his balance then charged toward the king beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade again Ten heartbeats An eternity The archers continued to fire and more than a few of their shafts bristled form the chasmfiends face It ignored them though Sadeass larger arrows still seemed to distract it Adolin had sheared through another leg and the creature lumbered uncertainly eight of its fourteen legs dragging uselessly Father Dalinar turned to see Renarindressed in a stiff blue Kholin uniform with a long coat buttoning to the neckriding across the rocky ground Father are you well Can I help Fool boy Dalinar said pointing Go But Youre unarmored and unarmed Dalinar bellowed Get back before you get yourself killed Renarin pulled his roan horse to a halt GO Renarin galloped away Dalinar turned and ran toward Elhokar Oathbringer misting into existence in his waiting hand Elhokar continued to hack at the beasts lower torso and sections of flesh blackened and died when the Shardblade struck If he rammed the Shardblade in just right he could stop the heart or lungs but that would be difficult while the beast was upright Adolinstalwart as alwayshad dismounted beside the king He tried to stop the claws striking at them as they fell Unfortunately there were four claws and only one of Adolin Two swung at him at once and though Adolin sliced a chunk out of one he didnt see the other sweeping at his back Dalinar called out too late Shardplate snapped as the claw tossed Adolin into the air He arced and hit in a tumble His Plate didnt shatter thank the Heralds but the breastplate and side cracked widely leaking trails of white smoke Adolin rolled lethargically hands moving He was alive No time to think about him now Elhokar was alone The beast struck pounding the ground beside the king knocking him off his feet His blade vanished and Elhokar fell facefirst on the stones Something changed inside of Dalinar Reservations vanished Other concerns became meaningless His brothers son was in danger He had failed Gavilar had lain drunk in his wine while his brother fought for his life Dalinar should have been there to defend him Only two things remained of his beloved brother two things that Dalinar could protect in a hope to earn some form of redemption Gavilars kingdom and Gavilars son Elhokar was alone and in danger Nothing else mattered Adolin shook his head dazed He slammed his visor up taking a gasp of fresh air to clear his mind Fighting They were fighting He could hear men screaming rocks shaking an enormous bleating sound He smelled something moldy Greatshell blood The chasmfiend he thought Before his mind was even clear Adolin began summoning his Blade again and forced himself to his hands and knees The monster loomed a short distance away a dark shadow upon the sky Adolin had fallen near its right side As his vision lost its fuzziness he saw that the king was down and his armor was cracked from the blow hed taken earlier The chasmfiend raised a massive claw preparing to slam it down Adolin knewsuddenlythat disaster was upon them The king would be killed on a simple hunt The kingdom would shatter the highprinces divided the one tenuous link that kept them together cut away No Adolin thought stunned still dazed trying to stumble forward And then he saw his father Dalinar charged toward the king moving with a speed and grace no mannot even one wearing Shardplateshould be able to manage He leaped over a rock shelf then ducked and skidded beneath a claw swinging for him Other men thought they understood Shardblades and Shardplate but Dalinar Kholinat times he proved them all children Dalinar straightened and leapedstill moving forwardcresting by inches a second claw that smashed apart the rocky shelf behind him It was all just a moment A breath The third claw was falling toward the king and Dalinar roared leaping forward He dropped his Bladeit hit the ground and puffed awayas he skidded beneath the falling claw He raised his hands and And he caught it He bent beneath the blow going down on one knee and the air rang with a resounding clang of carapace against armor But he caught it Stormfather Adolin thought watching his father stand over the king bowed beneath the enormous weight of a monster many times his size Shocked archers hesitated Sadeas lowered his grandbow Adolins breath caught in his chest Dalinar held back the claw and matched its strength a figure in dark silvery metal that almost seemed to glow The beast trumpeted above and Dalinar bellowed back a powerful defiant yell In that moment Adolin knew he was seeing him The Blackthorn the very man hed been wishing he could fight alongside The Plate of Dalinars gauntlets and shoulders began to crack webs of light moving down the ancient metal Adolin finally shook himself into motion I have to help His Shardblade formed in his hand and he scrambled to the side and sheared through the leg nearest to him There was a crack in the air With so many legs down the beasts other legs couldnt hold its weight particularly when it was trying so hard to crush Dalinar The remaining legs on its right side snapped with a sickening crunch spraying out violet ichor and the beast toppled to the side The ground shook nearly knocking Adolin to his knees Dalinar tossed aside the nowlimp claw Stormlight from the many cracks steaming above him Nearby the king picked himself up off the groundit had been mere seconds since hed fallen Elhokar stumbled to his feet looking at the fallen beast Then he turned to his uncle the Blackthorn Dalinar nodded thankfully to Adolin then gestured sharply toward what passed for the beasts neck Elhokar nodded then summoned his Blade and rammed it deeply into the monsters flesh The creatures uniform green eyes blackened and shriveled smoke twisting into the air Adolin walked up to join his father watching as Elhokar plunged his Blade into the chasmfiends chest Now that the beast was dead the Blade could cut its flesh Violet ichor spurted out and Elhokar dropped his blade and reached into the wound questing with Plateenhanced arms grabbing something He ripped free the beasts gemheartthe enormous gemstone that grew within all chasmfiends It was lumpy and uncut but it was a pure emerald and as big as a mans head It was the largest gemheart Adolin had ever seen and even the small ones were worth a fortune Elhokar held aloft the grisly prize golden gloryspren appearing around him and the soldiers yelled in triumph Let me first assure you that the element is quite safe I have found a good home for it I protect its safety like I protect my own skin you might say The morning after his decision in the highstorm Kaladin made certain to arise before the others He threw off his blanket and strode through the room full of blanketed lumps He didnt feel excited but he did feel resolute Determined to fight again He began that fight by throwing the door open to the sunlight Groans and curses sounded behind him as the groggy bridgemen awoke Kaladin turned toward them hands on hips Bridge Four currently had thirtyfour members That number fluctuated but at least twentyfive were needed to carry the bridge Anything below that and the bridge would topple for certain Sometimes it did even with more members Up and organize Kaladin shouted in his best squadleaders voice He shocked himself with the authority in it The men blinked bleary eyes That means Kaladin bellowed out of the barrack and form ranks Youll do it now storm you or Ill haul you out one by one myself Syl fluttered down and landed on his shoulder watching curiously Some of the bridgemen sat up staring at him baffled Others turned over in their blankets putting their backs to him Kaladin took a deep breath So be it He strode into the room and chose a lean Alethi named Moash He was a strong man Kaladin needed an example and one of the skinnier men like Dunny or Narm wouldnt do Plus Moash was one of those whod turned over to go back to sleep Kaladin grabbed Moash by one arm and heaved pulling with all his strength Moash stumbled to his feet He was a younger man perhaps near Kaladins age and had a hawkish face Storm off Moash snapped pulling his arm back Kaladin punched Moash right in the gut where he knew it would wind him Moash gasped in shock doubling over and Kaladin stepped forward to grab him by the legs slinging Moash over his shoulder Kaladin almost toppled from the weight Luckily carrying bridges was harsh but effective strength training Of course few bridgemen survived long enough to benefit from it It didnt help that there were unpredictable lulls between runs That was part of the problem the bridge crews spent most of their time staring at their feet or doing menial chores then were expected to run for miles carrying a bridge He carted the shocked Moash outside and set him down on the stone The rest of the camp was awake woodworkers arriving at the lumberyard soldiers jogging to their breakfast or training The other bridge crews of course were still asleep They were often allowed to sleep late unless they were on morning bridge duty Kaladin left Moash and walked back into the lowceilinged barrack Ill do the same to each of you if I have to He didnt have to The shocked bridgemen filed out into the light blinking Most stood barebacked to the sunlight wearing only kneelength trousers Moash climbed to his feet rubbing his stomach and glaring at Kaladin Things are going to change in Bridge Four Kaladin said For one thing there will be no more sleeping in And what are we going to do instead Sigzil demanded He had dark brown skin and black hairthat meant he was Makabaki from southwestern Roshar He was the only bridgeman without a beard and judging by his smooth accent he was probably Azish or Emuli Foreigners were common in bridge crewsthose who didnt fit in often made their way to the crem of an army Excellent question Kaladin said We are going to train Each morning before our daily chores we will run the bridge in practice to build up our endurance More than one of the mens expressions grew dark at this I know what you are thinking Kaladin said Arent our lives hard enough Shouldnt we be able to relax during the brief times we have for it Yeah said Leyten a tall stout man with curly hair Thats right No Kaladin snapped Bridge runs exhaust us because we spend most of our days lounging Oh I know we have choresforaging in the chasms cleaning latrines scrubbing floors But the soldiers dont expect us to work hard they just want us busy The work helps them ignore us As your bridgeleader my primary duty is to keep you alive Theres not much I can do about the Parshendi arrows so I have to do something about you I have to make you stronger so that when you charge that last leg of a bridge runarrows flyingyou can run quickly He met the eyes of the men in the line one at a time I intend to see that Bridge Four never loses another man The men stared at him incredulously Finally a hefty thicklimbed man at the back bellowed out a laugh He had tan skin deep red hair and was nearly seven feet tall with large arms and a powerful torso The Unkalakisimply called Horneaters by mostwere a group of people from the middle of Roshar near Jah Keved Hed given his name as Rock the previous night Crazy said the Horneater Is crazy man who now thinks to lead us He laughed in a deepbellied way The others joined him shaking their heads at Kaladins speech A few laughtersprenminnowlike silver spirits that darted through the air in circular patternsbegan to zip about them Hey Gaz Moash called cupping his hand around his mouth The short oneeyed sergeant was chatting with some soldiers nearby What Gaz yelled back with a scowl This one wants us to carry bridges about as practice Moash called back Do we have to do what he says Bah Gaz said waving a hand Bridgeleaders only have authority in the field Moash glanced back at Kaladin Looks like you can storm off friend Unless youre going to beat us all into submission They broke apart some men wandering back into the barrack some walking toward the mess halls Kaladin was left standing alone on the stones That didnt go so well Syl said from his shoulder No It didnt You look surprised No just frustrated He glared at Gaz The bridge sergeant turned away from him pointedly In Amarams army I was given men who were inexperienced but never ones who were blatantly insubordinate Whats the difference Syl asked Such an innocent question The answer should have been obvious but she cocked her head in confusion The men in Amarams army knew they had worse places they could go You could punish them These bridgemen know theyve reached the bottom With a sigh he let some of his tension bleed away Im lucky I got them out of the barrack So what do you do now I dont know Kaladin glanced to the side where Gaz still stood chatting with the soldiers Actually yes I do Gaz caught sight of Kaladin approaching and displayed a look of urgent wideeyed horror He broke off his conversation and hastily rushed around the side of a stack of logs Syl Kaladin said could you follow him for me She smiled then became a faint line of white shooting through the air and leaving a trail that vanished slowly Kaladin stopped where Gaz had been standing Syl zipped back a short time later and reassumed her girlish form Hes hiding between those two barracks She pointed Hes crouched there watching to see if you follow With a smile Kaladin took the long way around the barracks In the alleyway he found a figure crouching in the shadows watching in the other direction Kaladin crept forward then grabbed Gazs shoulder Gaz let out a yelp spinning swinging Kaladin caught the fist easily Gaz looked up at Kaladin with horror I wasnt going to lie Storm you you dont have authority anywhere other than on the field If you hurt me again Ill have you Calm yourself Gaz Kaladin said releasing the man Im not going to hurt you Not yet at least The shorter man backed away rubbing his shoulder and glaring at Kaladin Todays third pass Kaladin said Payday You get your pay in an hour like everyone else No You have it now I saw you talking to the courier there He held out his hand Gaz grumbled but pulled out a pouch and counted spheres Tiny tentative white lights shone at their centers Diamond marks each worth five diamond chips A single chip would buy a loaf of bread Gaz counted out four marks though there were five days to a week He handed them to Kaladin but Kaladin left his hand open palm forward The other one Gaz You said Now Gaz jumped then pulled out a sphere You have a strange way of keeping your word lordling You promised me He trailed off as Kaladin took the sphere hed just been given and handed it back Gaz frowned Dont forget where this comes from Gaz Ill keep to my word but you arent keeping part of my pay Im giving it to you Understand Gaz looked confused though he did snatch the sphere from Kaladins hand The money stops coming if something happens to me Kaladin said tucking the other four spheres into his pocket Then he stepped forward Kaladin was a tall man and he loomed over the much shorter Gaz Remember our bargain Stay out of my way Gaz refused to be intimidated He spat to the side the dark spittle clinging to the rock wall oozing slowly I aint going to lie for you If you think one cremstained mark a week will I expect only what I said What is Bridge Fours camp duty today Evening meal Scrubbing and cleaning And bridge duty Afternoon shift That meant the morning would be open The crew would like that they could spend payday losing their spheres on gambling or whores perhaps forgetting for a short time the miserable lives they lived Theyd have to be back for afternoon duty waiting in the lumberyard in case there was a bridge run After evening meal theyd go scrub pots Another wasted day Kaladin turned to walk back to the lumberyard You arent going to change anything Gaz called after him Those men are bridgemen for a reason Kaladin kept walking Syl zipping down from the roof to land on his shoulder You dont have authority Gaz called Youre not some squadleader on the field Youre a storming bridgeman You hear me You cant have authority without a rank Kaladin left the alleyway behind Hes wrong Syl walked around to hang in front of his face hovering there while he moved She cocked her head at him Authority doesnt come from a rank Kaladin said fingering the spheres in his pocket Where does it come from From the men who give it to you Thats the only way to get it He looked back the way hed come Gaz hadnt left the alleyway yet Syl you dont sleep do you Sleep A spren She seemed amused by the concept Would you watch over me at night he said Make sure Gaz doesnt sneak in and try something while Im sleeping He may try to have me killed You think hed actually do that Kaladin thought for a moment No No probably not Ive known a dozen men like himpetty bullies with just enough power to be annoying Gaz is a thug but I dont think hes a murderer Besides in his opinion he doesnt have to hurt me he just has to wait until I get killed on a bridge run Still best to be safe Watch over me if you would Wake me if he tries something Sure But what if he just goes to more important men Tells them to execute you Kaladin grimaced Then theres nothing I can do But I dont think hed do that It would make him look weak before his superiors Besides beheading was reserved for bridgemen who wouldnt run at the Parshendi So long as he ran he wouldnt be executed In fact the army leaders seemed hesitant to do much to punish bridgemen at all One man had committed murder while Kaladin had been a bridgeman and theyd strung the fool up in a highstorm But other than that all Kaladin had seen was a few men get their wages garnished for brawling and a couple get whipped for being too slow during the early part of a bridge run Minimal punishments The leaders of this army understood The lives of bridgemen were as close to hopeless as possible shove them down too much further and the bridgemen might just stop caring and let themselves be killed Unfortunately that also meant that there wouldnt be much Kaladin could do to punish his own crew even if hed had that authority He had to motivate them in another way He crossed the lumberyard to where the carpenters were constructing new bridges After some searching Kaladin found what he wanteda thick plank waiting to be fitted into a new portable bridge A handhold for a bridgeman had been affixed to one side Can I borrow this Kaladin asked a passing carpenter The man raised a hand to scratch a sawdustpowdered head Borrow it Ill stay right here in the lumberyard Kaladin explained lifting the board and putting it on his shoulder It was heavier than hed expected and he was thankful for the padded leather vest Well need it eventually the carpenter said but didnt offer enough of an objection to stop Kaladin from walking away with the plank He chose a level stretch of stone directly in front of the barracks Then he began to trot from one end of the lumberyard to the other carrying the board on his shoulder feeling the heat of the rising sun on his skin He went back and forth back and forth He practiced running walking and jogging He practiced carrying the plank on his shoulder then carrying it up high arms stretched out He worked himself ragged In fact he felt close to collapsing several times but every time he did he found a reserve of strength from somewhere So he kept moving teeth gritted against the pain and fatigue counting his steps to focus The apprentice carpenter hed spoken to brought a supervisor over That supervisor scratched his head beneath his cap watching Kaladin Finally he shrugged and the two of them withdrew Before long he drew a small crowd Workers in the lumberyard some soldiers and a large number of bridgemen Some from the other bridge crews called gibes but the members of Bridge Four were more withdrawn Many ignored him Othersgrizzled Teft youthfulfaced Dunny several morestood watching in a line as if they couldnt believe what he was doing Those staresstunned and hostile though they werewere part of what kept Kaladin going He also ran to work out his frustration that boiling churning pot of anger within Anger at himself for failing Tien Anger at the Almighty for creating a world where some dined in luxury while others died carrying bridges It felt surprisingly good to wear himself down in a way he chose He felt as he had those first few months after Tiens death training himself on the spear to forget When the noon bells rangcalling the soldiers to lunchKaladin finally stopped and set the large plank down on the ground He rolled his shoulder Hed been running for hours Where had he found the strength He jogged over to the carpenters station dripping sweat to the stones and took a long drink from the water barrel The carpenters usually chased off bridgemen who tried that but none said a word as Kaladin slurped down two full ladles of metallic rainwater He shook the ladle free and nodded to a pair of apprentices then jogged back to where hed left the plank Rockthe large tanskinned Horneaterwas hefting it frowning Teft noticed Kaladin then nodded to Rock He bet a few of us a chip each that youd used a lightweight board to impress us If they could have felt his exhaustion they wouldnt have been so skeptical He forced himself to take the plank from Rock The large man let it go with a bewildered look watching as Kaladin ran the plank back to where hed found it He waved his thanks to the apprentice then trotted back to the small cluster of bridgemen Rock was reluctantly paying out chips on his bet Youre dismissed for lunch Kaladin told them We have afternoon bridge duty so be back here in an hour Assemble at the mess hall at last bell before sundown Our camp chore today is cleaning up after supper Last one to arrive has to do the pots They gave him bemused expressions as he trotted away from the lumberyard Two streets away he ducked into an alleyway and leaned against the wall Then wheezing he sank to the ground and stretched out He felt as if hed strained every muscle in his body His legs burned and when he tried to make his hand into a fist the fingers were too weak to fully comply He breathed in and out in deep gasps coughing A passing soldier peeked in but when he saw the bridgemans outfit he left without a word Eventually Kaladin felt a light touch on his chest He opened his eyes and found Syl lying prone in the air face toward his Her feet were toward the wall but her postureindeed the way her dress hungmade it seem as if she were standing upright not face toward the ground Kaladin she said I have something to tell you He closed his eyes again Kaladin this is important He felt a slight jolt of energy on his eyelid It was a very strange sensation He grumbled opening his eyes and forcing himself to sit She walked in the air as if circumnavigating an invisible sphere until she was standing up in the right direction I have decided Syl declared that Im glad you kept your word to Gaz even if he is a disgusting person It took Kaladin a moment to realize what she was talking about The spheres She nodded I thought you might break your word but Im glad you didnt All right Well thank you for telling me I guess Kaladin she said petulantly making fists at her side This is important I He trailed off then rested his head back against the wall Syl I can barely breathe let alone think Please Just tell me whats bothering you I know what a lie is she said moving over and sitting on his knee A few weeks ago I didnt even understand the concept of lying But now Im happy that you didnt lie Dont you see No Im changing She shiveredit must have been an intentional action for her entire figure fuzzed for a moment I know things I didnt just a few days ago It feels so strange Well I guess thats a good thing I mean the more you understand the better Right She looked down When I found you near the chasm after the highstorm yesterday she whispered you were going to kill yourself werent you Kaladin didnt respond Yesterday That was an eternity ago I gave you a leaf she said A poisonous leaf You could have used it to kill yourself or someone else Thats what you were probably planning to use it for in the first place back in the wagons She looked back up into his eyes and her tiny voice seemed terrified Today I know what death is Why do I know what death is Kaladin Kaladin frowned Youve always been odd for a spren Even from the start From the very start He hesitated thinking back No the first few times shed come shed acted like any other windspren Playing pranks on him sticking his shoe to the floor then hiding Even when shed persisted with him during the months of his slavery shed acted mostly like any other spren Losing interest in things quickly flitting around Yesterday I didnt know what death was she said Today I do Months ago I didnt know I was acting oddly for a spren but I grew to realize that I was How do I even know how a spren is supposed to act She shrank down looking smaller Whats happening to me What am I I dont know Does it matter Shouldnt it I dont know what I am either A bridgeman A surgeon A soldier A slave Those are all just labels Inside Im me A very different me than I was a year ago but I cant worry about that so I just keep moving and hope my feet take me where I need to go You arent angry at me for bringing you that leaf Syl if you hadnt interrupted me Id have stepped off into the chasm That leaf was what I needed It was the right thing somehow She smiled and watched as Kaladin began to stretch Once he finished he stood and stepped out onto the street again mostly recovered from his exhaustion She zipped into the air and rested on his shoulder sitting with her arms back and her feet hanging down in front like a girl on the side of a cliff Im glad youre not angry Though I do think that youre to blame for whats happening to me Before I met you I never had to think about death or lying Thats how I am he said dryly Bringing death and lies wherever I go Me and the Nightwatcher She frowned That was he began Yes she said That was sarcasm She cocked her head I know what sarcasm is Then she smiled deviously I know what sarcasm is Stormfather Kaladin thought looking into those gleeful little eyes That strikes me as ominous So wait he said This sort of thing has never happened to you before I dont know I cant remember anything farther back than about a year ago when I first saw you Really Thats not odd Syl said shrugging translucent shoulders Most spren dont have long memories She hesitated I dont know why I know that Well maybe this is normal You could have gone through this cycle before but youve just forgotten it Thats not very comforting I dont like the idea of forgetting But dont death and lying make you uncomfortable They do But if I were to lose these memories She glanced into the air and Kaladin traced her movements noting a pair of windspren darting through the sky on a gusting breeze uncaring and free Scared to go onward Kaladin said but terrified to go back to what you were She nodded I know how you feel he said Come on I need to eat and there are some things I want to pick up after lunch You do not agree with my quest I understand that so much as it is possible to understand someone with whom I disagree so completely Four hours after the chasmfiend attack Adolin was still overseeing the cleanup In the struggle the monster had destroyed the bridge leading back to the warcamps Fortunately some soldiers had been left on the other side and theyd gone to fetch a bridge crew Adolin walked amid the soldiers gathering reports as the late afternoon sun inched toward the horizon The air had a musty moldy scent The smell of greatshell blood The beast itself lay where it had fallen chest cut open Some soldiers were harvesting its carapace amid cremlings that had come out to feast on the carcass To Adolins left long lines of men lay in rows using cloaks or shirts as pillows on the ragged plateau surface Surgeons from Dalinars army tended them Adolin blessed his father for always bringing the surgeons even on a routine expedition like this one He continued on his way still wearing his Shardplate The troops could have made their way back to the warcamps by another routethere was still a bridge on the other side leading farther out onto the Plains They could have moved eastward then wrapped back around Dalinar however had made the callmuch to Sadeass dismaythat they would wait and tend the wounded resting the few hours it would take to get a bridge crew Adolin glanced toward the pavilion which tinkled with laughter Several large rubies glowed brightly set atop poles with worked golden tines holding them in place They were fabrials that gave off heat though there was no fire involved He didnt understand how fabrials worked though the more spectacular ones needed large gemstones to function Once again the other lighteyes enjoyed their leisure while he worked This time he didnt mind He would have found it difficult to enjoy himself after such a disaster And it had been a disaster A minor lighteyed officer approached carrying a final list of casualties The mans wife read it then they left him with the sheet and retreated There were nearly fifty men dead twice as many wounded Many were men Adolin had known When the king had been given the initial estimate he had brushed aside the deaths indicating that theyd be rewarded for their valor with positions in the Heraldic Forces above He seemed to have conveniently forgotten that hed have been one of the casualties himself if not for Dalinar Adolin sought out his father with his eyes Dalinar stood at the edge of the plateau looking eastward again What did he search for out there This wasnt the first time Adolin had seen such extraordinary actions from his father but they had seemed particularly dramatic Standing beneath the massive chasmfiend holding it back from killing his nephew Plate glowing That image was fixed in Adolins memory The other lighteyes stepped more lightly around Dalinar now and during the last few hours Adolin hadnt heard a single mention of his weakness not even from Sadeass men He feared it wouldnt last Dalinar was heroic but only infrequently In the weeks that followed the others would begin to talk again of how he rarely went on plateau assaults about how hed lost his edge Adolin found himself thirsting for more Today when Dalinar had leaped to protect Elhokar hed acted like the stories said he had during his youth Adolin wanted that man back The kingdom needed him Adolin sighed turning away He needed to give the final casualty report to the king Likely hed be mocked for it but perhapsin waiting to deliver ithe might be able to listen in on Sadeas Adolin still felt he was missing something about that man Something his father saw but he did not So steeling himself for the barbs he made his way toward the pavilion Dalinar faced eastward with gauntleted hands clasped behind his back Somewhere out there at the center of the Plains the Parshendi made their base camp Alethkar had been at war for nearly six years engaging in an extended siege The siege strategy had been suggested by Dalinar himselfstriking at the Parshendi base would have required camping on the Plains weathering highstorms and relying on a large number of fragile bridges One failed battle and the Alethi could have found themselves trapped and surrounded without any way back to fortified positions But the Shattered Plains could also be a trap for the Parshendi The eastern and southern edges were impassablethe plateaus there were weathered to the point that many were little more than spires and the Parshendi could not jump the distance between them The Plains were edged by mountains and packs of chasmfiends prowled the land between enormous and dangerous With the Alethi army boxing them in on the west and northand with scouts placed south and east just in casethe Parshendi could not escape Dalinar had argued that the Parshendi would run out of supplies Theyd either have to expose themselves and try to escape the Plains or would have to attack the Alethi in their fortified warcamps It had been an excellent plan Except Dalinar hadnt anticipated the gemhearts He turned from the chasm walking across the plateau He itched to go see to his men but he needed to show trust in Adolin He was in command and he would do well by it In fact it seemed he was already taking some final reports over to Elhokar Dalinar smiled looking at his son Adolin was shorter than Dalinar and his hair was blond mixed with black The blond was an inheritance from his mother or so Dalinar had been told Dalinar himself remembered nothing of the woman She had been excised from his memory leaving strange gaps and foggy areas Sometimes he could remember an exact scene with everyone else crisp and clear but she was a blur He couldnt even remember her name When others spoke it it slipped from his mind like a pat of butter sliding off a toohot knife He left Adolin to make his report and walked up to the chasmfiends carcass It lay slumped over on its side eyes burned out mouth lying open There was no tongue just the curious teeth of a greatshell with a strange complex network of jaws Some flat platelike teeth for crushing and destroying shells and other smaller mandibles for ripping off flesh or shoving it deeper into the throat Rockbuds had opened nearby their vines reaching out to lap up the beasts blood There was a connection between a man and the beast he hunted and Dalinar always felt a strange melancholy after killing a creature as majestic as a chasmfiend Most gemhearts were harvested quite differently than the one had been today Sometime during the strange life cycle of the chasmfiends they sought the western side of the Plains where the plateaus were wider They climbed up onto the tops and made a rocky chrysalis waiting for the coming of a highstorm During that time they were vulnerable You just had to get to the plateau where it rested break into its chrysalis with some mallets or a Shardblade then cut out the gemheart Easy work for a fortune And the beasts came frequently often several times a week so long as the weather didnt get too cold Dalinar looked up at the hulking carcass Tiny nearinvisible spren were floating out of the beasts body vanishing into the air They looked like the tongues of smoke that might come off a candle after being snuff ed Nobody knew what kind of spren they were you only saw them around the freshly killed bodies of greatshells He shook his head The gemhearts had changed everything for the war The Parshendi wanted them too wanted them badly enough to extend themselves Fighting the Parshendi for the greatshells made sense for the Parshendi could not replenish their troops from home as the Alethi could So contests over the greatshells were both profitable and a tactically sound way of advancing the siege With the evening coming on Dalinar could see lights twinkling across the Plains Towers where men watched for chasmfiends coming up to pupate Theyd watch through the night though chasmfiends rarely came in the evening or night The scouts crossed chasms with jumping poles moving very lightly from plateau to plateau without the need of bridges Once a chasmfiend was spotted the scouts would sound warning and it became a raceAlethi against Parshendi Seize the plateau and hold it long enough to get out the gemheart attack the enemy if they got there first Each highprince wanted those gemhearts Paying and feeding thousands of troops was not cheap but a single gemheart could cover a highprinces expenses for months Beyond that the larger a gemstone was when used by a Soulcaster the less likely it was to shatter Enormous gemheart stones offered nearlimitless potential And so the highprinces raced The first one to a chrysalis got to fight the Parshendi for the gemheart They could have taken turns but that was not the Alethi way Competition was doctrine to them Vorinism taught that the finest warriors would have the holy privilege of joining the Heralds after death fighting to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls from the Voidbringers The highprinces were allies but they were also rivals To give up a gemheart to anotherwell it felt wrong Better to have a contest And so what had been a war had become sport instead Deadly sportbut that was the best kind Dalinar left the fallen chasmfiend behind He understood each step in the process of what had happened during these six years Hed even hastened some of them Only now did he worry They were making headway in cutting down the Parshendi numbers but the original goal of vengeance for Gavilars murder had nearly been forgotten The Alethi lounged they played and they idled Even though theyd killed plenty of Parshendias many as a quarter of their originally estimated forces were deadthis was just taking so long The siege had lasted six years and could easily take another six That troubled him Obviously the Parshendi had expected to be besieged here Theyd prepared supply dumps and had been ready to move their entire population to the Shattered Plains where they could use these Heraldsforsaken chasms and plateaus like hundreds of moats and fortifications Elhokar had sent messengers demanding to know why the Parshendi had killed his father They had never given an answer Theyd taken credit for his murder but had offered no explanation Of late it seemed that Dalinar was the only one who still wondered about that Dalinar turned to the side Elhokars attendants had retired to the pavilion enjoying wine and refreshments The large opensided tent was dyed violet and yellow and a light breeze ruffled the canvas There was a small chance that another highstorm might arrive tonight the stormwardens said Almighty send that the army was back to the camp if one did come Highstorms Visions Unite them Did he really believe in what hed seen Did he really think that the Almighty himself had spoken to him Dalinar Kholin the Blackthorn a fearsome warlord Unite them At the pavilion Sadeas walked out into the night He had removed his helm revealing a head of thick black hair that curled and tumbled around his shoulders He cut an imposing figure in his Plate he certainly looked much better in armor than he did wearing one of those ridiculous costumes of lace and silk that were popular these days Sadeas caught Dalinars eyes nodding slightly My part is done that nod said Sadeas strolled for a moment then reentered the pavilion So Sadeas had remembered the reason for inviting Vamah on the hunt Dalinar would have to seek out Vamah He made his way toward the pavilion Adolin and Renarin lurked near the king Had the lad given his report yet It seemed likely that Adolin was tryingyet againto listen in on Sadeass conversations with the king Dalinar would have to do something about that the boys personal rivalry with Sadeas was understandable perhaps but counterproductive Sadeas was chatting with the king Dalinar made to go find Vamahthe other highprince was near the back of the pavilionbut the king interrupted him Dalinar the king said Come here Sadeas tells me he has won three gemhearts in the last few weeks alone He has indeed Dalinar said approaching How many have you won Including the one today No the king said Before this None Your Majesty Dalinar admitted Its Sadeass bridges Elhokar said Theyre more efficient than yours I may not have won anything the last few weeks Dalinar said stiffly but my army has won its share of skirmishes in the past And the gemhearts can go to Damnation for all I care Perhaps Elhokar said but what have you done lately I have been busy with other important things Sadeas raised an eyebrow More important than the war More important than vengeance Is that possible Or are you just making excuses Dalinar gave the other highprince a pointed look Sadeas just shrugged They were allies but they were not friends Not any longer You should switch to bridges like his Elhokar said Your Majesty Dalinar said Sadeass bridges waste many lives But they are also fast Sadeas said smoothly Relying on wheeled bridges is foolish Dalinar Getting them over this plateau terrain is slow and plodding The Codes state that a general may not ask a man to do anything he would not do himself Tell me Sadeas Would you run at the front of those bridges you use I wouldnt eat gruel either Sadeas said dryly or cut ditches But you might if you had to Dalinar said The bridges are different Stormfather you dont even let them use armor or shields Would you enter combat without your Plate The bridgemen serve a very important function Sadeas snapped They distract the Parshendi from firing at my soldiers I tried giving them shields at first And you know what The Parshendi ignored the bridgemen and fired volleys onto my soldiers and horses I found that by doubling the number of bridges on a run then making them extremely lightno armor no shields to slow themthe bridgemen work far better You see Dalinar The Parshendi are too tempted by the exposed bridgemen to fire at anyone else Yes we lose a few bridge crews in each assault but rarely so many that it hinders us The Parshendi just keep firing at themI assume that for whatever reason they think killing the bridgemen hurts us As if an unarmored man carrying a bridge was worth the same to the army as a mounted knight in Plate Sadeas shook his head in amusement at the thought Dalinar frowned Brother Gavilar had written You must find the most important words a man can say A quote from the ancient text The Way of Kings It would disagree strongly with the things Sadeas was implying Regardless Sadeas continued Surely you cant argue with how effective my method has been Sometimes Dalinar said the prize is not worth the costs The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself Sadeas looked at Dalinar incredulously Even Adolin and Renarinwho had come closerseemed shocked by the statement It was a very unAlethi way of thinking With the visions and the words of that book spinning in his mind lately Dalinar wasnt feeling particularly Alethi The prize is worth any cost Brightlord Dalinar Sadeas said Winning the competition is worth any effort any expense It is a war Dalinar said Not a contest Everything is a contest Sadeas said with a wave of his hand All dealings among men are a contest in which some will succeed and others fail And some are failing quite spectacularly My father is one of the most renowned warriors in Alethkar Adolin snapped butting into the group The king raised an eyebrow at him but otherwise stayed out of the conversation You saw what he did earlier Sadeas while you were hiding back by the pavilion with your bow My father held off the beast Youre a cowa Adolin Dalinar said That was going too far Restrain yourself Adolin clenched his jaw hand to his side as if itching to summon his Shardblade Renarin stepped forward and gently placed a hand on Adolins arm Reluctantly Adolin backed down Sadeas turned to Dalinar smirking One son can barely control himself and the other is incompetent This is your legacy old friend I am proud of them both Sadeas whatever you think The firebrand I can understand Sadeas said You were once impetuous just like him But the other one You saw how he ran out onto the field today He even forgot to draw his sword or bow Hes useless Renarin flushed looking down Adolin snapped his head up He thrust his hand to the side again stepping forward toward Sadeas Adolin Dalinar said I will handle this Adolin looked at him blue eyes alight with rage but he did not summon his Blade Dalinar turned his attention to Sadeas speaking very softly very pointedly Sadeas Surely I did not just hear you openlybefore the kingcall my son useless Surely you would not say that as such an insult would demand that I summon my Blade and seek your blood Shatter the Vengeance Pact Cause the kings two greatest allies to kill one another Surely you would not have been that foolish Surely I misheard Everything grew still Sadeas hesitated He didnt back down he met Dalinars gaze But he did hesitate Perhaps Sadeas said slowly you did hear the wrong words I would not insult your son That would not have beenwise of me An understanding passed between them stares locked and Dalinar nodded Sadeas did as wellone curt nod of the head They would not let their hatred of one another become a danger to the king Barbs were one thing but dueling offenses were another They couldnt risk that Well Elhokar said He allowed his highprinces to jostle and contend for status and influence He believed they were all stronger for it and few faulted him it was an established method of rule More and more Dalinar found himself disagreeing Unite them I guess we can be done with that Elhokar said To the side Adolin looked unsatisfied as if hed really been hoping that Dalinar would summon his Blade and confront Sadeas Dalinars own blood felt hot the Thrill tempting him but he shoved it down No Not here Not now Not while Elhokar needed them Perhaps we can be done Your Majesty Sadeas said Though I doubt this particular discussion between Dalinar and me will ever be done At least until he relearns how to act as a man should I said that is quite enough Sadeas Elhokar said Quite enough you say a new voice added I believe that a single word from Sadeas is quite enough for anyone Wit picked his way through the groups of attendants holding a cup of wine in one hand silver sword belted at his side Wit Elhokar exclaimed When did you get here I caught up to your party just before the battle Your Majesty Wit said bowing I was going to speak with you but the chasmfiend beat me to you I hear your conversation with it was rather energizing But you arrived hours ago then What have you been doing How could I have missed seeing you here I hadthings to be about Wit said But I couldnt stay away from the hunt I wouldnt want you to lack for me Ive done well so far And yet you were still Witless Wit noted Dalinar studied the blackclad man What to make of Wit He was clever And yet he was too free with his thoughts as hed shown with Renarin earlier This Wit had a strange air about him that Dalinar couldnt quite place Brightlord Sadeas Wit said taking a sip of wine Im terribly sorry to see you here I should think Sadeas said dryly that you would be happy to see me I seem always to provide you with such entertainment That is unfortunately true Wit said Unfortunately Yes You see Sadeas you make it too easy An uneducated halfbrained serving boy with a hangover could make mock of you I am left with no need to exert myself and your very nature makes mockery of my mockery And so it is that through sheer stupidity you make me look incompetent Really Elhokar Sadeas said Must we put up with thiscreature I like him Elhokar said smiling He makes me laugh At the expense of those who are loyal to you Expense Wit cut in Sadeas I dont believe youve ever paid me a sphere Though no please dont offer I cant take your money as I know how many others you must pay to get what you wish of them Sadeas flushed but kept his temper A whore joke Wit Is that the best you can manage Wit shrugged I point out truths when I see them Brightlord Sadeas Each man has his place Mine is to make insults Yours is to be insluts Sadeas froze then grew redfaced You are a fool If the Wit is a fool then it is a sorry state for men I shall offer you this Sadeas If you can speak yet say nothing ridiculous I will leave you alone for the rest of the week Well I think that shouldnt be too difficult And yet you failed Wit said sighing For you said I think and I can imagine nothing so ridiculous as the concept of you thinking What of you young Prince Renarin Your father wishes me to leave you alone Can you speak yet say nothing ridiculous Eyes turned toward Renarin who stood just behind his brother Renarin hesitated eyes opening wide at the attention Dalinar grew tense Nothing ridiculous Renarin said slowly Wit laughed Yes I suppose that will satisfy me Very clever If Brightlord Sadeas should lose control of himself and finally kill me perhaps you can be Kings Wit in my stead You seem to have the mind for it Renarin perked up which darkened Sadeass mood further Dalinar eyed the highprince Sadeass hand had gone to his sword Not a Shardblade for Sadeas didnt have one But he did carry a lighteyess side sword Plenty deadly Dalinar had fought beside Sadeas on many occasions and the man was an expert swordsman Wit stepped forward So what of it Sadeas he asked softly You going to do Alethkar a favor and rid it of us both Killing the Kings Wit was legal But by so doing Sadeas would forfeit his title and lands Most men found it a poor enough trade not to do it in the open Of course if you could assassinate a Wit without anyone knowing it was you that was something different Sadeas slowly removed his hand from the hilt of his sword then nodded curtly to the king and strode away Wit Elhokar said Sadeas has my favor Theres no need to torment him so I disagree Wit said The kings favor may be torment enough for most men but not him The king sighed and looked toward Dalinar I should go placate Sadeas Ive been meaning to ask you though Have you looked into the issue I asked you about earlier Dalinar shook his head I have been busy with the needs of the army But I will look into it now Your Majesty The king nodded then hastened off after Sadeas What was that Father Adolin asked Is it about the people he thinks were spying on him No Dalinar said This is something new Ill show you shortly Dalinar looked toward Wit The blackclad man was popping his knuckles one at a time looking at Sadeas seeming contemplative He noticed Dalinar watching and winked then walked away I like him Adolin repeated I might be persuaded to agree Dalinar said rubbing his chin Renarin Dalinar said go and get a report on the wounded Adolin come with me We need to check into the matter the king spoke of Both young men looked confused but they did as requested Dalinar started across the plateau toward where the carcass of the chasmfiend lay Let us see what your worries have brought us this time nephew he thought Adolin turned the long leather strap over in his hands Almost a handspan wide and a fingers width thick the strap ended in a ragged tear It was the girth to the kings saddle the strap that wrapped under the horses barrel It had broken suddenly during the fight throwing the saddleand the kingfrom horseback What do you think Dalinar asked I dont know Adolin said It doesnt look that worn but I guess it was otherwise it wouldnt have snapped right Dalinar took the strap back looking contemplative The soldiers still hadnt returned with the bridge crew though the sky was darkening Father Adolin said Why would Elhokar ask us to look into this Does he expect us to discipline the grooms for not properly caring for his saddle Is it Adolin trailed off and he suddenly understood his fathers hesitation The king thinks the strap was cut doesnt he Dalinar nodded He turned it over in his gauntleted fingers and Adolin could see him thinking about it A girth could get so worn that it would snap particularly when strained by the weight of a man in Shardplate This strap had broken off at the point where it had been affixed to the saddle so it would have been easy for the grooms to miss it That was the most rational explanation But when looked at with slightly more irrational eyes it could seem that something nefarious had happened Father Adolin said hes getting increasingly paranoid You know he is Dalinar didnt reply He sees assassins in every shadow Adolin continued Straps break That doesnt mean someone tried to kill him If the king is worried Dalinar said we should look into it The break is smoother on one side as if it were sliced so that it would rip when it was stressed Adolin frowned Maybe He hadnt noticed that But think about it Father Why would someone cut his strap A fall from horseback wouldnt harm a Shardbearer If it was an assassination attempt then it was an incompetent one If it was an assassination attempt Dalinar said even an incompetent one then we have something to worry about It happened on our watch and his horse was cared for by our grooms We will look into this Adolin groaned some of his frustration slipping out The others already whisper that weve become bodyguards and pets of the king What will they say if they hear that were chasing down his every paranoid worry no matter how irrational I have never cared what they say We spend all our time on bureaucracy while others win wealth and glory We rarely go on plateau assaults because were busy doing things like this We need to be out there fighting if were ever going to catch up to Sadeas Dalinar looked at him frown deepening and Adolin bit off his next outburst I see that were no longer talking about this broken girth Dalinar said IIm sorry I spoke in haste Perhaps you did But then again perhaps I needed to hear it I noticed that you didnt particularly like how I held you back from Sadeas earlier I know you hate him too Father You do not know as much as you presume you do Dalinar said Well do something about that in a moment For now I swearthis strap does look like it was cut Perhaps there is something were not seeing This could have been part of something larger that didnt work the way it had been anticipated Adolin hesitated It seemed overcomplicated but if there was a group who liked their plots overly complicated it was the Alethi lighteyes Do you think one of the highprinces may have tried something Maybe Dalinar said But I doubt any of them want him dead So long as Elhokar rules the highprinces get to fight in this war their way and fatten their purses He doesnt make many demands of them They like having him as their king Men can covet the throne for the distinction alone True When we return see if anyone has been bragging too much of late Check to see if Roion is still bitter about Wits insult at the feast last week and have Talata go over the contracts Highprince Bethab offered to the king for the use of his chulls In previous contracts hes tried to slip in language that would favor his claim in a succession Hes been bold ever since your aunt Navani left Adolin nodded See if you can backtrack the girths history Dalinar said Have a leatherworker look at it and tell you what he thinks of the rip Ask the grooms if they noticed anything and watch to see if any have received any suspicious windfalls of spheres lately He hesitated And double the kings guard Adolin turned glancing at the pavilion Sadeas was strolling out of it Adolin narrowed his eyes Do you think No Dalinar interrupted Sadeas is an eel Son you have to stop fixating on him He likes Elhokar which cant be said of most of the others Hes one of the few Id trust the kings safety to I wouldnt do the same Father I can tell you that Dalinar fell silent for a moment Come with me He handed Adolin the saddle strap then began to cross the plateau toward the pavilion I want to show you something about Sadeas Resigned Adolin followed They passed the lit pavilion Inside darkeyed men served food and drink while women sat and scribed messages or wrote accounts of the battle The lighteyes spoke with one another in verbose excited tones complimenting the kings bravery The men wore dark masculine colors maroon navy forest green deep burnt orange Dalinar approached Highprince Vamah who stood outside the pavilion with a group of his own lighteyed attendants He was dressed in a fashionable long brown coat that had slashes cut through it to expose the bright yellow silk lining It was a subdued fashion not as ostentatious as wearing silks on the outside Adolin thought it looked nice Vamah himself was a roundfaced balding man The short hair that remained stuck straight up and he had light grey eyes He had a habit of squintingwhich he did as Dalinar and Adolin approached What is this about Adolin wondered Brightlord Dalinar said to Vamah I have come to make certain your comfort has been seen to My comfort would be best seen to if we could be on our way back Vamah glared over at the setting sun as if blaming it for some misdeed He wasnt normally so foulmooded Im certain that my men are moving as quickly as they can Dalinar said It wouldnt be nearly as late if you hadnt slowed us so much on the way here Vamah said I like to be careful Dalinar said And speaking of care there is something Ive been meaning to talk to you about Might my son and I speak to you alone for a moment Vamah scowled but let Dalinar lead him away from his attendants Adolin followed more and more baffled The beast was a large one Dalinar said to Vamah nodding toward the fallen chasmfiend The biggest Ive seen I suppose I hear youve had success on your recent plateau assaults killing a few cocooned chasmfiends of your own You are to be congratulated Vamah shrugged The ones we won were small Nothing like that gemheart that Elhokar took today A small gemheart is better than none Dalinar said politely I hear that you have plans to augment the walls of your warcamp Hum Yes Fill in a few of the gaps improve the fortification Ill be certain to tell His Majesty that youll be wanting to purchase extra access to the Soulcasters Vamah turned to him frowning Soulcasters For lumber Dalinar said evenly Surely you dont intend to fill in the walls without using scaffolding Out here on these remote plains its fortunate that we have Soulcasters to provide things like wood wouldnt you say Er yes Vamah said expression darkening further Adolin looked from him to his father There was a subtext to the conversation Dalinar wasnt speaking only of wood for the wallsthe Soulcasters were the means by which all of the highprinces fed their armies The king is quite generous in allowing access to the Soulcasters Dalinar said Wouldnt you agree Vamah I take your point Dalinar Vamah said dryly No need to keep bashing the rock into my face Ive never been known as a subtle man Brightlord Dalinar said Just an effective one He walked away waving for Adolin to follow Adolin did so looking over his shoulder at the other highprince Hes been complaining vocally about the fees that Elhokar charges to use his Soulcasters Dalinar said softly It was the primary form of taxation the king levied on the highprinces Elhokar himself didnt fight for or win gemhearts except on the occasional hunt He stood aloof from fighting personally in the war as was appropriate And so Adolin said So I reminded Vamah of how much he relies on the king I suppose thats important But what does it have to do with Sadeas Dalinar didnt answer He kept walking across the plateau stepping up to the lip of the chasm Adolin joined him waiting A few seconds later someone approached from behind in clinking Shardplate then Sadeas stepped up beside Dalinar at the lip of the chasm Adolin narrowed his eyes at the man and Sadeas raised an eyebrow but said nothing about his presence Dalinar Sadeas said turning his eyes forward looking out across the Plains Sadeas Dalinars voice was controlled and curt You spoke with Vamah Yes He saw through what I was doing Of course he did There was a hint of amusement in Sadeass voice I wouldnt have expected anything else You told him you were increasing what you charge him for wood Sadeas controlled the only large forest in the region Doubling it Sadeas said Adolin looked over his shoulder Vamah was watching them stand there and his expression was as thunderous as a highstorm angerspren boiling up from the ground around him like small pools of bubbling blood Dalinar and Sadeas together sent him a very sound message Whythis is probably why they invited him on the hunt Adolin realized So they could maneuver him Will it work Dalinar asked Im certain it will Sadeas said Vamahs an agreeable enough fellow when proddedhell see that its better to use the Soulcasters than spend a fortune running a supply line back to Alethkar Perhaps we should tell the king about these sorts of things Dalinar said glancing at the king who stood in the pavilion oblivious of what had been done Sadeas sighed Ive tried he hasnt a mind for this sort of work Leave the boy to his preoccupations Dalinar His are the grand ideals of justice holding the sword high as he rides against his fathers enemies Lately he seems less preoccupied with the Parshendi and more worried about assassins in the night Dalinar said The boys paranoia worries me I dont know where he gets it Sadeas laughed Dalinar are you serious Im always serious I know I know But surely you can see where the boy comes by the paranoia From the way his father was killed From the way his uncle treats him A thousand guards Halts on each and every plateau to let soldiers secure the next one over Really Dalinar I like to be careful Others call that being paranoid The Codes The Codes are a bunch of idealized nonsense Sadeas said devised by poets to describe the way they think things should have been Gavilar believed in them And look where it got him And where were you Sadeas when he was fighting for his life Sadeass eyes narrowed So were going to rehash that now Like old lovers crossing paths unexpectedly at a feast Adolins father didnt reply Once again Adolin found himself baffled by Dalinars relationship with Sadeas Their barbs were genuine one needed only look in their eyes to see that the men could barely stand one another And yet here they were apparently planning and executing a joint manipulation of another highprince Ill protect the boy my way Sadeas said You do it your way But dont complain to me about his paranoia when you insist on wearing your uniform to bed just in case the Parshendi suddenly decideagainst all reason and precedentto attack the warcamps I dont know where he gets it indeed Lets go Adolin Dalinar said turning to stride away Adolin followed Dalinar Sadeas called from behind Dalinar hesitated looking back Have you found it yet Sadeas asked Why he wrote what he did Dalinar shook his head Youre not going to find the answer Sadeas said Its a foolish quest old friend One thats tearing you apart I know what happens to you during storms Your mind is unraveling because of all this stress you put upon yourself Dalinar returned to walking away Adolin hurried after him What had that last part been about Why he wrote Men didnt write Adolin opened his mouth to ask but he could sense his fathers mood This was not a time to prod him He walked with Dalinar up to a small rock hill on the plateau They picked their way up it to the top and from there looked out at the fallen chasmfiend Dalinars men continued harvesting its meat and carapace He and his father stood there for a time Adolin brimming with questions yet unable to find a way to phrase them Eventually Dalinar spoke Have I ever told you what Gavilars final words to me were You havent Ive always wondered about that night Brother follow the Codes tonight There is something strange upon the winds Thats what he said to me the last thing he told me just before we began the treatysigning celebration I didnt realize that Uncle Gavilar followed the Codes Hes the one who first showed them to me He found them as a relic of old Alethkar back when wed first been united He began following them shortly before he died Dalinar grew hesitant Those were odd days son Jasnah and I werent sure what to think of the changes in Gavilar At the time I thought the Codes foolishness even the one that commanded an officer to avoid strong drink during times of war Especially that one His voice grew even softer I was unconscious on the ground when Gavilar was murdered I can remember voices trying to wake me up but I was too addled by my wine I should have been there for him He looked to Adolin I can not live in the past It is foolishness to do so I blame myself for Gavilars death but there is nothing to be done for him now Adolin nodded Son I keep hoping that if I make you follow the Codes long enough you will seeas I havetheir importance Hopefully you will not need as dramatic an example of it as I did Regardless you need to understand You speak of Sadeas of beating him of competing with him Do you know of Sadeass part in my brothers death He was the decoy Adolin said Sadeas Gavilar and Dalinar had been good friends up until the kings death Everyone knew it They had conquered Alethkar together Yes Dalinar said He was with the king and heard the soldiers crying that a Shardbearer was attacking The decoy idea was Sadeass planhe put on one of Gavilars robes and fled in Gavilars place It was suicide what he did Wearing no Plate making a Shardbearer assassin chase him I honestly think it was one of the bravest things Ive ever known a man to do But it failed Yes And theres a part of me that can never forgive Sadeas for that failure I know its irrational but he should have been there with Gavilar Just like I should have been We both failed our king and we can not forgive one another But the two of us are still united in one thing We made a vow on that day Wed protect Gavilars son No matter what the cost no matter what other things came between us we would protect Elhokar And so thats why Im here on these Plains It isnt wealth or glory I care nothing for those things not any longer I came for the brother I loved and for the nephew I love in his own right And in a way this is what divides Sadeas and me even as it unites us Sadeas thinks that the best way to protect Elhokar is to kill the Parshendi He drives himself and his men brutally to get to those plateaus and fight I believe a part of him thinks Im breaking my vow by not doing the same But thats not the way to protect Elhokar He needs a stable throne allies that support him not highprinces that bicker Making a strong Alethkar will protect him better than killing our enemies will This was Gavilars lifes work uniting the highprinces He trailed off Adolin waited for more but it did not come Sadeas Adolin finally said Imsurprised to hear you call him brave He is brave And cunning Sometimes I make the mistake of letting his extravagant dress and mannerisms lead me to underestimate him But theres a good man inside of him son He is not our enemy We can be petty sometimes the two of us But he works to protect Elhokar so I ask you to respect that How did one respond to that You hate him but you ask me not to All right Adolin said Ill watch myself around him But Father I still dont trust him Please At least consider the possibility that hes not as committed as you are that hes playing you Very well Dalinar said Ill consider it Adolin nodded It was something What of what he said at the end Something about writing Dalinar hesitated It is a secret he and I share Other than us only Jasnah and Elhokar know of it Ive contemplated for a time whether I should tell you as you will take my place should I fall I spoke to you of the last words my brother said to me Asking you to follow the Codes Yes But there is more Something else he said to me but not with spoken words Instead these are words thathe wrote Gavilar could write When Sadeas discovered the kings body he found words written on the fragment of a board using Gavilars own blood Brother they said You must find the most important words a man can say Sadeas hid the fragment away and we later had Jasnah read the words If it is true that he could writeand other possibilities seem implausibleit was a shameful secret he hide As I said his actions grew very odd near the end of his life And what does it mean Those words Its a quote Dalinar said From an ancient book called The Way of Kings Gavilar favored readings from the volume near the end of his lifehe spoke to me of it often I didnt realize the quote was from it until recently Jasnah discovered it for me Ive now had the text of the book read to me a few times but so far I find nothing to explain why he wrote what he did He paused The book was used by the Radiants as a kind of guidebook a book of counsel on how to live their lives The Radiants Stormfather Adolin thought The delusions his father hadthey often seemed to have something to do with the Radiants This was further proof that the delusions were related to Dalinars guilt over his brothers death But what could Adolin do to help Metal footsteps ground on the rock behind Adolin turned then nodded in respect as the king approached still wearing his golden Shardplate though hed removed the helm He was several years Adolins senior and had a bold face with a prominent nose Some said they saw in him a kingly air and a regal bearing and women Adolin trusted had confided that they found the king quite handsome Not as handsome as Adolin of course But still handsome The king was married however his wife the queen managed his affairs back in Alethkar Uncle Elhokar said Can we not be on our way Im certain that we Shardbearers could leap the chasm You and I could be back at the warcamps shortly I will not leave my men Your Majesty Dalinar said And I doubt you want to be running across the plateaus for several hours alone exposed without proper guards I suppose the king said Either way I did want to thank you for your bravery today It appears that I owe you my life yet again Keeping you alive is something else I try very hard to make a habit Your Majesty I am glad for it Have you looked into the item I asked you about He nodded to the girth which Adolin realized he was still carrying in a gauntleted hand I did Dalinar said Well We couldnt decide Your Majesty Dalinar said taking the strap and handing it to the king It may have been cut The tear is smoother along one side Like it was weakened so that it would rip I knew it Elhokar held the strap up and inspected it We are not leatherworkers Your Majesty Dalinar said We need to give both sides of the strap to experts and get their opinions I have instructed Adolin to look into the matter further It was cut Elhokar said I can see it clearly right here I keep telling you Uncle Someone is trying to kill me They want me just like they wanted my father Surely you dont think the Parshendi did this Dalinar said sounding shocked I dont know who did it Perhaps someone on this very hunt Adolin frowned What was Elhokar implying The majority of the people on this hunt were Dalinars men Your Majesty Dalinar said frankly we will look into the matter But you have to be prepared to accept that this might have just been an accident You dont believe me Elhokar said flatly You never believe me Dalinar took a deep breath and Adolin could see that his father had to struggle to keep his temper Im not saying that Even a potential threat to your life worries me very much But I do suggest that you avoid leaping to conclusions Adolin has pointed out that this would be a terribly clumsy way to try to kill you A fall from horseback isnt a serious threat to a man wearing Plate Yes but during a hunt Elhokar said Perhaps they wanted the chasmfiend to kill me We werent supposed to be in danger from the hunt Dalinar said We were supposed to pelt the greatshell from a distance then ride up and butcher it Elhokar narrowed his eyes looking at Dalinar then at Adolin It was almost as if the king were suspicious of them The look was gone in a second Had Adolin imagined it Stormfather he thought From behind Vamah began calling to the king Elhokar glanced at him and nodded This isnt over Uncle he said to Dalinar Look into that strap I will The king handed the strap back then left armor clinking Father Adolin said immediately did you see Ill speak to him about it Dalinar said Sometime when he isnt so worked up But I will speak to him Adolin You look into that strap And go gather your men He nodded toward something in the distant west I think I see that bridge crew coming Finally Adolin thought following his gaze A small group of figures was crossing the plateau in the distance bearing Dalinars banner and leading a bridge crew carrying one of Sadeass mobile bridges Theyd sent for one of those as they were faster than Dalinars larger chullpulled bridges Adolin hurried off to give the orders though he found himself distracted by his fathers words Gavilars final message and now the kings look of distrust It seemed he would have plenty to preoccupy his mind on the long ride back to the camps Dalinar watched Adolin rush away to do as ordered The lads breastplate still bore a web of cracks though it had stopped leaking Stormlight With time the armor would repair itself It could reform even if it was completely shattered The lad liked to complain but he was as good a son as a man could ask for Fiercely loyal with initiative and a strong sense of command The soldiers liked him Perhaps he was a little too friendly with them but that could be forgiven Even his hotheadedness could be forgiven assuming he learned to channel it Dalinar left the young man to his work and went to check on Gallant He found the Ryshadium with the grooms who had set up a horse picket on the southern side of the plateau They had bandaged the horses scrapes and he was no longer favoring his leg Dalinar patted the large stallion on the neck looking into those deep black eyes The horse seemed ashamed It wasnt your fault you threw me Gallant Dalinar said in a soothing voice Im just glad you werent harmed too badly He turned to a nearby groom Give him extra feed this evening and two crispmelons Yes sir Brightlord But he wont eat extra food He never does if we try to give it to him Hell eat it tonight Dalinar said patting the Ryshadiums neck again He only eats it when he feels he deserves it son The lad seemed confused Like most of them he thought of Ryshadium as just another breed of horse A man couldnt really understand until hed had one accept him as rider It was like wearing Shardplate an experience that was completely indescribable Youll eat both of those crispmelons Dalinar said pointing at the horse You deserve them Gallant blustered You do Dalinar said The horse nickered seeming content Dalinar checked the leg then nodded to the groom Take good care of him son Ill ride another horseback Yes Brightlord They got him a mounta sturdy dustcolored mare He was extra careful when he swung into the saddle Ordinary horses always seemed so fragile to him The king rode out after the first squad of troops Wit at his side Sadeas Dalinar noted rode behind where Wit couldnt get at him The bridge crew waited silently resting as the king and his procession crossed Like most of Sadeass bridge crews this one was constructed from a jumble of human refuse Foreigners deserters thieves murderers and slaves Many probably deserved their punishment but the frightful way Sadeas chewed through them put Dalinar on edge How long would it be before he could no longer fill the bridge crews with the suitably expendable Did any man even a murderer deserve such a fate A passage from The Way of Kings came to Dalinars head unbidden Hed been listening to readings from the book more often than hed represented to Adolin I once saw a spindly man carrying a stone larger than his head upon his back the passage went He stumbled beneath the weight shirtless under the sun wearing only a loincloth He tottered down a busy thoroughfare People made way for him Not because they sympathized with him but because they feared the momentum of his steps You dare not impede one such as this The monarch is like this man stumbling along the weight of a kingdom on his shoulders Many give way before him but so few are willing to step in and help carry the stone They do not wish to attach themselves to the work lest they condemn themselves to a life full of extra burdens I left my carriage that day and took up the stone lifting it for the man I believe my guards were embarrassed One can ignore a poor shirtless wretch doing such labor but none ignore a king sharing the load Perhaps we should switch places more often If a king is seen to assume the burden of the poorest of men perhaps there will be those who will help him with his own load so invisible yet so daunting Dalinar was shocked that he could remember the story word for word though he probably shouldnt have been In searching for the meaning behind Gavilars last message hed listened to readings from the book almost every day of the last few months Hed been disappointed to find that there was no clear meaning behind the quote Gavilar had left Hed continued to listen anyway though he tried to keep his interest quiet The book did not have a good reputation and not just because it was associated with the Lost Radiants Stories of a king doing the work of a menial laborer were the least of its discomforting passages In other places it outright said that lighteyes were beneath darkeyes That contradicted Vorin teachings Yes best to keep this quiet Dalinar had spoken truly when hed told Adolin he didnt care what people said about him But when the rumors impeded his ability to protect Elhokar they could become dangerous He had to be careful He turned his mount and clopped up onto the bridge then nodded his thanks to the bridgemen They were the lowest in the army and yet they bore the weight of kings SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO He wants to send me to Kharbranth Kal said perched atop his rock To train to become a surgeon What really Laral asked as she walked across the edge of the rock just in front of him She had golden streaks in her otherwise black hair She wore it long and it streamed out behind her in a gust of wind as she balanced hands out to the sides The hair was distinctive But of course her eyes were more so Bright pale green So different from the browns and blacks of the townspeople There really was something different about being a lighteyes Yes really Kal said with a grunt Hes been talking about it for a couple of years now And you didnt tell me Kal shrugged He and Laral were atop a low ridge of boulders to the east of Hearthstone Tien his younger brother was picking through rocks at the base To Kals right a grouping of shallow hillsides rolled to the west They were sprinkled with lavis polyps a planting halfway to being harvested He felt oddly sad as he looked over those hillsides filled with working men The dark brown polyps would grow like melons filled with grain After being dried that grain would feed the entire town and their highprinces armies The ardents who passed through town were careful to explain that the Calling of a farmer was a noble one one of the highest save for the Calling of a soldier Kals father whispered under his breath that he saw far more honor in feeding the kingdom than he did in fighting and dying in useless wars Kal Laral said voice insistent Why didnt you tell me Sorry he said I wasnt sure if Father was serious or not So I didnt say anything That was a lie Hed known his father was serious Kal just hadnt wanted to mention leaving to become a surgeon particularly not to Laral She placed her hands on her hips I thought you were going to go become a soldier Kal shrugged She rolled her eyes hopping down off her ridge onto a stone beside him Dont you want to become a lighteyes Win a Shardblade Father says that doesnt happen very often She knelt down before him Im sure you could do it Those eyes so bright and alive shimmering green the color of life itself More and more Kal found that he liked looking at Laral Kal knew logically what was happening to him His father had explained the process of growing with the precision of a surgeon But there was so much feeling involved emotions that his fathers sterile descriptions hadnt explained Some of those emotions were about Laral and the other girls of the town Other emotions had to do with the strange blanket of melancholy that smothered him at times when he wasnt expecting I Kal said Look Laral said standing up again and climbing atop her rock Her fine yellow dress ruffled in the wind One more year and shed start wearing a glove on her left hand the mark that a girl had entered adolescence Up come on Look Kal hauled himself to his feet looking eastward There snarlbrush grew in dense thickets around the bases of stout markel trees What do you see Laral demanded Brown snarlbrush Looks like its probably dead The Origin is out there she said pointing This is the stormlands Father says were here to be a windbreak for more timid lands to the west She turned to him Weve got a noble heritage Kal darkeyes and lighteyes alike Thats why the best warriors have always been from Alethkar Highprince Sadeas General AmaramKing Gavilar himself I suppose She sighed exaggeratedly I hate talking to you when youre like this you know Like what Like you are now You know Moping around sighing Youre the one who just sighed Laral You know what I mean She stepped down from the rock walking over to go pout She did that sometimes Kal stayed where he was looking eastward He wasnt sure how he felt His father really wanted him to be a surgeon but he wavered It wasnt just because of the stories the excitement and wonder of them He felt that by being a soldier he could change things Really change them A part of him dreamed of going to war of protecting Alethkar of fighting alongside heroic lighteyes Of doing good someplace other than a little town that nobody important ever visited He sat down Sometimes he dreamed like that Other times he found it hard to care about anything His dreary feelings were like a black eel coiled inside of him The snarlbrush out there survived the storms by growing together densely about the bases of the mighty markel trees Their bark was coated with stone their branches thick as a mans leg But now the snarlbrush was dead It hadnt survived Pulling together hadnt been enough for it Kaladin a voice asked from behind him He turned to find Tien Tien was ten years old two years Kals junior though he looked much younger While other kids called him a runt Lirin said that Tien just hadnt hit his height yet But well with those round flushed cheeks and that slight build Tien did look like a boy half his age Kaladin he said eyes wide hands cupped together What are you looking at Dead weeds Kal said Oh Well you need to see this What is it Tien opened his hands to reveal a small stone weathered on all sides but with a jagged break on the bottom Kal picked it up looking it over He couldnt see anything distinctive about it at all In fact it was dull Its just a rock Kal said Not just a rock Tien said taking out his canteen He wetted his thumb then rubbed it on the flat side of the stone The wetness darkened the stone and made visible an array of white patterns in the rock See Tien asked handing it back The strata of the rock alternated white brown black The pattern was remarkable Of course it was still just a rock But for some reason Kal found himself smiling Thats nice Tien He moved to hand the rock back Tien shook his head I found it for you To make you feel better I It was just a stupid rock Yet inexplicably Kal did feel better Thanks Hey you know what Ill bet theres a lurg or two hiding in these rocks somewhere Want to see if we can find one Yes yes yes Tien said He laughed and began moving down the rocks Kal moved to follow but paused remembering something his father had said He poured some water on his hand from his own canteen and flung it at the brown snarlbrush Wherever sprayed droplets fell the brush grew instantly green as if he were throwing paint The brush wasnt dead it just dried out waiting for the storms to come Kal watched the patches of green slowly fade back to tan as the water was absorbed Kaladin Tien yelled He often used Kals full name even though Kal had asked him not to Is this one Kal moved down across the boulders pocketing the rock hed been given As he did so he passed Laral She was looking westward toward her familys mansion Her father was the citylord of Hearthstone Kal found his eyes lingering on her again That hair of hers was beautiful with the two stark colors She turned to Kal and frowned Were going to hunt some lurgs he explained smiling and gesturing toward Tien Come on Youre cheerful suddenly I dont know I feel better How does he do that I wonder Who does what Your brother Laral said looking toward Tien He changes you Tiens head popped up behind some stones and he waved eagerly bouncing up and down with excitement Its just hard to be gloomy when hes around Kal said Come on Do you want to watch the lurg or not I suppose Laral said with a sigh She held out a hand toward him Whats that for Kal asked looking at her hand To help me down Laral youre a better climber than me or Tien You dont need help Its polite stupid she said proffering her hand more insistently Kal sighed and took it then she proceeded to hop down without even leaning on it or needing his help She he thought has been acting very strange lately The two of them joined Tien who jumped down into a hollow between some boulders The younger boy pointed eagerly A silky patch of white grew in a crevice on the rock It was made of tiny threads spun together into a ball about the size of a boys fist Im right arent I Tien asked That is one Kal lifted the flask and poured water down the side of the stone onto the patch of white The threads dissolved in the simulated rainwater the cocoon melting to reveal a small creature with slick brown and green skin The lurg had six legs that it used to grip the stone and its eyes were in the center of its back It hopped off the stone searching for insects Tien laughed watching it bounce from rock to rock sticking to the stones It left behind patches of mucus wherever it landed Kal leaned back against the stone watching his brother remembering daysnot so long agowhen chasing lurgs had been more exciting So Laral said folding her arms What are you going to do If your father tries to send you to Kharbranth I dont know Kal said The surgeons wont take anyone before their sixteenth Weeping so Ive got time to think The best surgeons and healers trained in Kharbranth Everyone knew that The city was said to have more hospitals than taverns It sounds like your father is forcing you to do what he wants not what you want Laral said Thats the way everyone does it Kal said scratching his head The other boys dont mind becoming farmers because their fathers were farmers and Ral just became the new town carpenter He didnt mind that it was what his father did Why should I mind being a surgeon I just Laral looked angry Kal if you go to war and find a Shardblade then youd be a lighteyes I meanOh this is useless She settled back folding her arms even more tightly Kal scratched his head She really was acting oddly I wouldnt mind going to war winning honor and all that Mostly Id like to travel See what other lands are like Hed heard tales of exotic animals like enormous crustaceans or eels that sang Of Rall Elorim City of Shadows or Kurth City of Lightning Hed spent a lot of time studying these last few years Kals mother said he should be allowed to have a childhood rather than focusing so much on his future Lirin argued that the tests to be admitted by the Kharbranthian surgeons were very rigorous If Kal wanted a chance with them hed have to begin learning early And yet to become a soldierThe other boys dreamed of joining the army of fighting with King Gavilar There was talk of going to war with Jah Keved once and for all What would it be like to finally see some of the heroes from stories To fight with Highprince Sadeas or Dalinar the Blackthorn Eventually the lurg realized that it had been tricked It settled down on a rock to spin its cocoon again Kal grabbed a small weathered stone off the ground then laid a hand on Tiens shoulder stopping the boy from prodding the tired amphibian Kal moved forward and nudged the lurg with two fingers making it hop off the boulder and onto his stone He handed this to Tien who watched with wide eyes as the lurg spun its cocoon spitting out the wet silk and using tiny hands to shape it That cocoon would be watertight from the inside sealed by dried mucus but rainwater outside would dissolve the sack Kal smiled then lifted the flask and drank This was cool clean water which had already had the crem settled out Cremthe sludgy brown material that fell with rainwatercould make a man sick Everybody knew that not just surgeons You always let water sit for a day then poured off the fresh water on top and used the crem to make pottery The lurg eventually finished its cocoon Tien immediately reached for the flask Kal held the flask high Itll be tired Tien It wont jump around anymore Oh Kal lowered the flask patting his brothers shoulder I put it on that stone so you could carry it around You can get it out later He smiled Or you could drop it in Fathers bathwater through the window Tien grinned at that prospect Kal ruffled the boys dark hair Go see if you can find another cocoon If we catch two youll have one to play with and one to slip into the bathwater Tien carefully set the rock aside then scampered up over the boulders The hillside here had broken during a highstorm several months back Shattered as if it had been hit by the fist of some enormous creature People said that it could have been a home that got destroyed They burned prayers of thanks to the Almighty while at the same time whispering of dangerous things that moved in the darkness at full storm Were the Voidbringers behind the destruction or had it been the shades of the Lost Radiants Laral was looking toward the mansion again She smoothed her dress nervouslylately she took far more care not getting her clothes dirty as she once had You still thinking about war Kal asked Um Yes I am Make sense he said An army had come through recruiting just a few weeks back and had picked up a few of the older boys though only after Citylord Wistiow had given permission What do you think broke the rocks here during the highstorm I couldnt say Kal looked eastward What sent the storms His father said no ship had ever sailed for the Origin of Storms and returned safely Few ships ever even left the coast Being caught on the open seas during a storm meant death so the stories said He took another sip from his flask then capped it saving the rest in case Tien found another lurg Distant men worked the fields wearing overalls laced brown shirts and sturdy boots It was worming season A single worm could ruin an entire polyps worth of grain It would incubate inside slowly eating as the grain grew When you finally opened up the polyp in the fall all youd find was a big fat slug the size of two mens hands And so they searched in the spring going over each polyp Where they found a burrow theyd stick in a reed tipped with sugar which the worm would latch on to You pulled it out and squished it under your heel then patched the hole with crem It could take weeks to properly worm a field and farmers usually went over their hills three or four times fertilizing as they went Kal had heard the process described a hundred times over You didnt live in a town like Hearthstone without listening to men gripe about worms Oddly he noticed a group older boys gathering at the foot of one of the hills He recognized all of them of course Jost and Jest brothers Mord Tift Naget Khav and others They each had solid Alethi darkeyes names Not like Kaladins own name It was different Why arent they worming he asked I dont know Laral said shifting her attention to the boys She got an odd look in her eyes Lets go see She started down the hillside before Kal had a chance to object He scratched his head looking toward Tien Were going down to the hillside there A youthful head popped up behind a boulder Tien nodded energetically then turned back to his searching Kal slipped off the boulder and walked down the slope after Laral She reached the boys and they regarded her with uncomfortable expressions Shed never spent much time with them not like she had with Kal and Tien Her father and his were pretty good friends for all that one was lighteyed and the other dark Laral took a perch on a nearby rock waiting and saying nothing Kal walked up Why had she wanted to come down here if she wasnt going to talk to the other boys Ho Jost Kal said Senior among the boys at fourteen Jost was nearly a manand he looked it too His chest was broad beyond his years his legs thick and stocky like those of his father He was holding a length of wood from a sapling that had been shaved into a rough approximation of a quarterstaff Why arent you worming It was the wrong thing to say and Kal knew it immediately Several of the boys expressions darkened It was a sore point to them that Kal never had to work the hills His proteststhat he spent hours upon hours memorizing muscles bones and curesfell on uncaring ears All they saw was a boy who got to spend his days in the shade while they toiled in the burning sun Old Tarn found a patch of polyps that aint growing right Jost finally said shooting a glance at Laral Let us go for the day while they talked over whether to try another planting there or just let them grow and see what comes of it Kal nodded feeling awkward as he stood before the nine boys They were sweaty the knees of their trousers stained with crem and patched from rubbing stone But Kal was clean wearing a fine pair of trousers his mother had purchased just a few weeks before His father had sent him and Tien out for the day while he tended to something at the citylords manor Kal would pay for the break with latenight studying by Stormlight but no use explaining that to the other boys So er Kal said what were you all talking about Rather than answering Naget said Kal you know things Light haired and spindly he was the tallest of the bunch Dont you About the world and the like Yeah Kal said scratching his head Sometimes You ever heard of a darkeyes becoming a lighteyes Naget asked Sure Kal said It can happen Father says Wealthy darkeyed merchants marry lowborn lighteyes and join their family Then maybe have lighteyed children That sort of thing No not like that Khav said He had low eyebrows and always seemed to have a perpetual scowl on his face You know Real darkeyes Like us Not like you the tone seemed to imply Kals family were the only one of second nahn in the town Everyone else was fourth or fifth and Kals rank made them uncomfortable around him His fathers strange profession didnt help either It all left Kal feeling distinctly outofplace You know how it can happen Kal said Ask Laral She was just talking about it If a man wins a Shardblade on the battlefield his eyes become light Thats right Laral said Everybody knows it Even a slave could become a lighteyes if he won a Shardblade The boys nodded they all had brown black or other darkcolored eyes Winning a Shardblade was one of the main reasons common men went to war In Vorin kingdoms everyone had a chance to rise It was as Kals father would say a fundamental tenet of their society Yeah Naget said impatiently But have you ever heard of it happening Not just in stories I mean Does it happen for real Sure Kal said It must Otherwise why would so many men go to war Because Jest said weve got ta prepare men to fight for the Tranquiline Halls Weve got ta send soldiers to the Heralds The ardents are always talking of it In the same breaths that they tell us its all right to be a farmer too Khav said Like farmings some lonely second place or something Hey Tift said My fahs a farmer and hes right good at it Its a noble Calling All your fahs are farmers All right fine Jost said But we aint talking of that Were talking of Shardbearers You go to war you can win a Shardblade and become a lighteyes My fah see he should have been given that Shardblade But the man who was with him he took it while my fah was knocked out Told the officer that hed been the one to kill the Shardbearer so he got the Blade and my fah He was cut off by Larals tinkling laughter Kal frowned That was a different kind of laughter than he normally heard from her much more subdued and kind of annoying Jost youre claiming your father won a Shardblade she said No It was taken from him the larger boy said Didnt your father fight in the wastescum skirmishes up north Laral said Tell him Kaladin Shes right Jost There werent any Shardbearers therejust Reshi raiders who thought theyd take advantage of the new king Theyve never had any Shardblades If your father saw one he must be remembering incorrectly Remembering incorrectly Jost said Er sure Kal said quickly Im not saying hes lying Jost He just might have some traumainduced hallucinations or something like that The boys grew silent looking at Kal One scratched his head Jost spat to the side He seemed to be watching Laral from the corner of his eye She pointedly looked at Kal and smiled at him You always got to make a man feel like an idiot dont you Kal Jost said What No I You want to make my fah sound like a fool Jost said face red And you want to make me sound stupid Well some of us aint lucky enough to spend our days eating fruit and laying about Weve got to work I dont Jost tossed the quarterstaff to Kal He caught it awkwardly Then Jost took the other staff from his brother You insult my fah you get a fight Thats honor You have honor lordling Im no lordling Kal spat Stormfather Jost Im only a few nahn higher than you are Josts eyes grew angrier at the mention of nahn He held up his quarterstaff You going to fight me or not Angerspren began to appear in small pools at his feet bright red Kal knew what Jost was doing It wasnt uncommon for the boys to look for a way to make themselves look better than him Kals father said it had to do with their insecurity Hed have told Kal to just drop the quarterstaff and walk away But Laral was sitting right there smiling at him And men didnt become heroes by walking away All right Sure Kal held up his quarterstaff Jost swung immediately more quickly than Kal had anticipated The other boys watched with a mixture of glee shock and amazement Kal barely managed to get his staff up The lengths of wood cracked together sending a jolt up Kals arms Kal was knocked off balance Jost moved quickly stepping to the side and swinging his staff down and hitting Kal in the foot Kal cried out as a flash of agony lanced up his leg and he released the staff with one hand and reached down Jost swung his staff around and hit Kals side Kal gasped letting the staff clatter to the stones and grabbing his side as he fell to his knees He breathed out in huffing breaths straining against the pain Small spindly painsprenglowing pale orange hand shapes like stretching sinew or musclescrawled from the stone around him Kal dropped one hand to the stones leaning forward as he held his side Youd better not have broken any of my ribs you cremling he thought To the side Laral pursed her lips Kal felt a sudden overpowering shame Jost lowered his staff looking abashed Well he said You can see that my fah trained me right good Maybe that will show you The things he says are true and Kal growled in anger and pain snatching his quarterstaff from the ground and leaping at Jost The older boy cursed stumbling backward as he raised his weapon Kal bellowed slamming his weapon forward Something changed in that moment Kal felt an energy as he held the weapon an excitement that washed away his pain He spun smashing the staff into one of Josts hands Jost let go with that hand screaming Kal brought his weapon around and slammed it into the boys side Kal had never held a weapon before never been in a fight any more dangerous than a wrestling match with Tien But the length of wood felt right in his fingers He was amazed by how wonderful the moment felt Jost grunted stumbling again and Kal brought his weapon back around preparing to smash Josts face He raised his staff but then froze Jost was bleeding from the hand Kal had hit Just a little but it was blood Hed hurt someone Jost growled and lurched upright Before Kal could protest the larger boy swept Kals legs from underneath him sending him to the ground knocking the breath from his lungs That set afire the wound in his side and the painspren scampered across the ground latching on to Kals side looking like an orange scar as they fed on Kals agony Jost stepped back Kal lay on his back breathing He didnt know what to feel Holding the staff in that moment had felt wonderful Incredible At the same time he could see Laral to the side She stood up and instead of kneeling to help him turned and walked away toward her fathers mansion Tears welled in Kals eyes With a shout he rolled over and grabbed the quarterstaff again He would not give in None of that now Jost said from behind Kal felt something hard on his back a boot shoving him down to the stone Jest took the staff from Kals fingers I failed Ilost He hated the feeling hated it far more than the pain You did well Jost said grudgingly But leave off I dont want to have to hurt you for real Kal bowed his head down letting his forehead rest on the warm sunlit rock Jost removed his foot and the boys withdrew chatting their boots scraping on rock Kal forced himself to his hands and knees then up onto his feet Jost turned back wary holding his quarterstaff in one hand Teach me Kal said Jost blinked in surprise He glanced at his brother Teach me Kal pled stepping forward Ill worm for you Jost My father gives me two hours off each afternoon Ill do your work then if youll teach me in the evenings what your father is teaching you with that staff He had to know Had to feel the weapon in his hands again Had to see if that moment hed felt had been a fluke Jost considered then finally shook his head Cant Your fah would kill me Get those surgeons hands of yours all covered with calluses Wouldnt be right He turned away You go be what you are Kal Ill be what I am Kal stood for a long while watching them go He sat down on the rock Larals figure was growing distant There were some servants coming down the hillside to fetch her Should he chase after her His side still hurt and he was annoyed at her for leading him down to the others in the first place And above all he was still embarrassed He lay back down emotions welling inside of him He had trouble sorting through them Kaladin He turned ashamed to find tears in his eyes and saw Tien sitting on the ground behind him How long have you been there Kal snapped Tien smiled then set a rock on the ground He climbed to his feet and hurried away not stopping when Kal called after him Grumbling Kal forced himself to his feet and walked over to pick up the rock It was another dull ordinary stone Tien had a habit of finding those and thinking they were incredibly precious He had an entire collection of them back in the house He knew where hed found each one and could tell you what was special about it With a sigh Kal began walking back toward the town You go be what you are Ill be what I am His side smarted Why hadnt he hit Jost when hed had the chance Could he train himself out of freezing in battle like that He could learn to hurt Couldnt he Did he want to You go be what you are What did a man do if he didnt know what he was Or even what he wanted to be Eventually he reached Hearthstone proper The hundred or so buildings were set in rows each one shaped like a wedge with the low side pointing stormward The roofs were of thick wood tarred to seal out the rain The northern and southern sides of the buildings rarely had windows but the frontsfacing west away from the stormswere nearly all window Like the plants of the stormlands the lives of men here were dominated by the highstorms Kals home was near the outskirts It was larger than most built wide to accommodate the surgery room which had its own entrance The door was ajar so Kal peeked in Hed expected to see his mother cleaning but instead found that his father had returned from Brightlord Wistiows manor Lirin sat on the edge of the operating table hands in his lap bald head bowed He held his spectacles in his hand and he looked exhausted Father Kal asked Why are you sitting in the dark Lirin looked up His face was somber distant Father Kal asked growing more concerned Brightlord Wistiow has been carried by the winds Hes dead Kal was so shocked he forgot his side Wistiow had always been there He couldnt be gone What of Laral He was healthy just last week He has always been frail Kal Lirin said The Almighty calls all men back to the Spiritual Realm eventually You didnt do anything Kal blurted out he regretted the words immediately I did all I could his father said rising Perhaps a man with more training than IWell there is no use in regrets He walked to the side of the room removing the black covering from the goblet lamp filled with diamond spheres It lit the room immediately blazing like a tiny sun We have no citylord then Kal said raising a hand to his head He had no son Those in Kholinar will appoint us a new citylord Lirin said Almighty send them wisdom in the choice He looked at the goblet lamp Those were the citylords spheres A small fortune Kals father put the covering right back on the goblet as if he hadnt just removed it The motion plunged the room back into darkness and Kal blinked as his eyes adjusted He left these to us Kals father said Kal started What Youre to be sent to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen These spheres will pay your wayBrightlord Wistiow requested it be done a last act to care for his people You will go and become a true master surgeon then return to Hearthstone In that moment Kal knew his fate had been sealed If Brightlord Wistiow had demanded it Kal would go to Kharbranth He turned and walked from the surgery room passing out into the sunlight not saying another word to his father He sat down on the steps What did he want He didnt know That was the problem Glory honor the things Laral had saidnone of those really mattered to him But there had been something there when hed held the quarterstaff And now suddenly the decision had been taken from him The rocks Tien had given him were still in his pocket He pulled them out then took his canteen off his belt and washed them with water The first one hed been given showed the white swirls and strata It appeared the other one had a hidden design too It looked like a face smiling at him made of white bits in the rock Kal smiled despite himself though it quickly faded A rock wasnt going to solve his problems Unfortunately though he sat for a long while thinking it didnt look like anything would solve his problems He wasnt sure he wanted to be a surgeon and he felt suddenly constricted by what life was forcing him to become But that one moment holding the quarterstaff sang to him A single moment of clarity in an otherwise confusing world Might I be quite frank Before you asked why I was so concerned It is for the following reason Hes old Syl said with awe flitting around the apothecary Really old I didnt know men got this old You sure hes not decayspren wearing a mans skin Kaladin smiled as the apothecary shuffled forward with his cane oblivious of the invisible windspren His face was as full of chasms as the Shattered Plains themselves weaving out in a pattern from his deeply recessed eyes He wore a pair of thick spectacles on the tip of his nose and was dressed in dark robes Kaladins father had told him of apothecariesmen who walked the line between herbalists and surgeons Common people regarded the healing arts with enough superstition that it was easy for an apothecary to cultivate an arcane air The wooden walls were draped with cloth glyphwards styled in cryptic patterns and behind the counter were shelves with rows of jars A full human skeleton hung in the far corner held together by wires The windowless room was lit with bundles of garnet spheres hanging from the corners Despite all that the place was clean and tidy It had the familiar scent of antiseptic Kaladin associated with his fathers surgery Ah young bridgeman The short apothecary adjusted his spectacles He stooped forward running his fingers through his wispy white beard Come for a ward against danger perhaps Or maybe a young washwoman in the camp has caught your eye I have a potion which if slipped into her drink will make her regard you with favor Kaladin raised an eyebrow Syl however opened her mouth in an amazed expression You should give that to Gaz Kaladin It would be nice if he liked you more I doubt thats what its intended for Kaladin thought with a smile Young bridgeman the apothecary asked Is it a charm against evil you desire Kaladins father had spoken of these things Many apothecaries purveyed supposed love charms or potions to cure all manner of ailments Theyd contain nothing more than some sugar and a few pinches of common herbs to give a spike of alertness or drowsiness depending on the purported effect It was all nonsense though Kaladins mother had put great stock in glyphwards Kaladins father had always expressed disappointment in her stubborn way of clinging to superstitions I need some bandages Kaladin said And a flask of listers oil or knobweed sap Also a needle and gut if you have any The apothecarys eyes opened wide in surprise Im the son of a surgeon Kaladin admitted Trained by his hand He was trained by a man who had studied in the Great Concourse of Kharbranth Ah the apothecary said Well He stood up straighter setting aside his cane and brushing his robes Bandages you said And some antiseptic Let me see He moved back behind the counter Kaladin blinked The mans age hadnt changed but he didnt seem nearly as frail His step was firmer and his voice had lost its whispering raspiness He searched through his bottles mumbling to himself as he read off his labels You could just go to the surgeons hall They would charge you far less Not for a bridgeman Kaladin said grimacing Hed been turned away The supplies there were for real soldiers I see the apothecary said setting a jar on the counter then bending down to poke in some drawers Syl flitted over to Kaladin Every time he bends I think hell snap like a twig She was growing able to understand abstract thought and at a surprisingly rapid pace I know what death is He still wasnt certain whether to feel sorry for her or not Kaladin picked up the small bottle and undid the cork smelling what was inside Larmic mucus He grimaced at the foul smell Thats not nearly as effective as the two I asked for But its far cheaper the old man said coming up with a large box He opened the lid revealing sterile white bandages And you as has been noted are a bridgeman How much for the mucus then Hed been worried about this his father had never mentioned how much his supplies cost Two bloodmarks for the bottle Thats what you consider cheap Listers oil costs two sapphire marks And knobweed sap Kaladin said I saw some of reeds of it growing just outside of camp It cant be that rare And do you know how much sap comes from a single plant the apothecary asked pointing Kaladin hesitated It wasnt true sap but a milky substance that you could squeeze from the stalks Or so his father had said No Kaladin admitted A single drop the man said If youre lucky Its cheaper than listers oil sure but more expensive than the mucus Even if the mucus does stink like the Nightwatchers own backside I dont have that much Kaladin said It was five diamond marks to a garnet Ten days pay to buy one small jar of antiseptic Stormfather The apothecary sniffed The needle and gut will cost two clearmarks Can you afford that at least Barely How much for the bandages Two full emeralds Theyre just old scraps that I bleached and boiled Two clearchips an arm length Ill give a mark for the box Very well Kaladin reached into his pocket to get the spheres as the old apothecary continued You surgeons all the same Never give a blink to consider where your supplies come from You just use them like there will be no end You cant put a price on a persons life Kaladin said One of his fathers sayings It was the main reason that Lirin had never charged for his services Kaladin brought out his four marks He hesitated when he saw them however Only one was still glowing with its soft crystal light The other three were dull the bits of diamond barely visible at the center of the drops of glass Here now the apothecary said squinting You trying to pass dun spheres off on me He snatched one before Kaladin could complain then fished around under his counter He brought up a jewelers loupe removing his spectacles and holding the sphere up toward the light Ah No thats a real gemstone You should get your spheres infused bridgeman Not everyone is as trusting as I am They were glowing this morning Kaladin protested Gaz must have paid me with rundown spheres The apothecary removed his loupe and replaced the spectacles He selected three marks including the glowing one Could I have that one Kaladin asked The apothecary frowned Always keep a glowing sphere in your pocket Kaladin said Its good luck You certain you dont want a love potion If you get caught in the dark youll have light Kaladin said tersely Besides as you said most people arent as trusting as you Reluctantly the apothecary traded the infused sphere for the dead onethough he did check it with the loupe to be certain A dun sphere was worth just as much as an infused one all you had to do was leave it out in a highstorm and it would recharge and give off light for a week or so Kaladin pocketed the infused sphere and picked up his purchase He nodded farewell to the apothecary and Syl joined him as he stepped out into the camps street Hed spent some of the afternoon listening to soldiers at the mess hall and hed learned some things about the warcamps Things he should have learned weeks ago but had been too despondent to care about He now knew about the chrysalises on the plateaus the gemhearts they contained and the competition between the highprinces He understood why Sadeas pushed his men so hard and he was beginning to see why Sadeas turned around if they got to the plateau later than another army That wasnt very common More often Sadeas arrived first and the other Alethi armies that came up behind them had to turn back The warcamps were enormous All told there were over a hundred thousand troops in the various Alethi camps many times the population of Hearthstone And that wasnt counting the civilians A mobile warcamp attracted a large array of camp followers stationary warcamps like these on the Shattered Plains brought even more Each of the ten warcamps filled its own crater and was filled with an incongruous mix of Soulcast buildings shanties and tents Some merchants like the apothecary had the money to build a wooden structure Those who lived in tents took them down for storms then paid for shelter elsewhere Even within the crater the stormwinds were strong particularly where the outer wall was low or broken Some placeslike the lumberyardwere completely exposed The street bustled with the usual crowd Women in skirts and blousesthe wives sisters or daughters of the soldiers merchants or craftsmen Workers in trousers or overalls A large number of soldiers in leathers carrying spear and shield All were Sadeass men Soldiers of one camp didnt mix with those of another and you stayed away from another brightlords crater unless you had business there Kaladin shook his head in dismay What Syl asked settling on his shoulder I hadnt expected there to be so much discord among the camps here I thought it would all be one kings army unified People are discord Syl said What does that mean You all act differently and think differently Nothing else is like thatanimals act alike and all spren are in a sense virtually the same individual Theres harmony in that But not in youit seems that no two of you can agree on anything All the world does as it is supposed to except for humans Maybe thats why you so often want to kill each other But not all windspren act alike Kaladin said opening the box and tucking some of the bandages into the pocket hed sewn into the inside of his leather vest Youre proof of that I know she said softly Maybe now you can see why it bothers me so Kaladin didnt know how to respond to that Eventually he reached the lumberyard A few members of Bridge Four lounged in the shade on the east side of their barrack It would be interesting to see one of those barracks get madethey were Soulcast directly from air into stone Unfortunately Soulcastings happened at night and under strict guard to keep the holy rite from being witnessed by anyone other than ardents or very highranking lighteyes The first afternoon bell sounded right as Kaladin reached the barrack and he caught a glare from Gaz for nearly being late for bridge duty Most of that duty would be spent sitting around waiting for the horns to blow Well Kaladin didnt intend to waste time He couldnt risk tiring himself by carrying the plank not when a bridge run could be imminent but perhaps he could do some stretches or A horn sounded in the air crisp and clean It was like the mythical horn that was said to guide the souls of the brave to heavens battlefield Kaladin froze As always he waited for the second blast an irrational part of him needing to hear confirmation It came sounding a pattern indicating the location of the pupating chasmfiend Soldiers began to scramble toward the staging area beside the lumberyard others ran into camp to fetch their gear Line up Kaladin shouted dashing up to the bridgemen Storm you Every man in a line They ignored him Some of the men werent wearing their vests and they clogged the barrack doorway all trying to get in Those who had their vests ran for the bridge Kaladin followed frustrated Once there the men gathered around the bridge in a carefully prearranged manner Each man got a chance to be in the best position running in front up to the chasm then moving to the relative safety of the back for the final approach There was a strict rotation and errors were neither made nor tolerated Bridge crews had a brutal system of selfmanagement If a man tried to cheat the others forced him to run the final approach in front That sort of thing was supposed to be forbidden but Gaz turned a blind eye toward cheaters He also refused bribes to let men change positions Perhaps he knew that the only stabilitythe only hopethe bridgemen had was in their rotation Life wasnt fair being a bridgeman wasnt fair but at least if you ran the deathline and survived the next time you got to run at the back There was one exception As bridgeleader Kaladin got to run in the front most of the way then move to the back for the assault His was the safest position in the group though no bridgeman was truly safe Kaladin was like a moldy crust on a starving mans plate not the first bite but still doomed He got into position Yake Dunny and Malop were the last stragglers Once theyd taken their places Kaladin commanded the men to lift He was half surprised to be obeyed but there was almost always a bridgeleader to give commands during a run The voice changed but the simple orders did not Lift run lower Twenty bridges charged down from the lumberyard and toward the Shattered Plains Kaladin noticed a group of bridgemen from Bridge Seven watching with relief Theyd been on duty until the first afternoon bell theyd avoided this run by mere moments The bridgemen worked hard It wasnt just because of threats of beatingsthey ran so hard because they wanted to arrive at the target plateau before the Parshendi did If they did so there would be no arrows no death And so running their bridges was the one thing the bridgemen did without reservation or laziness Though many hated their lives they still clung to them with whiteknuckled fervor They clomped across the first of the permanent bridges Kaladins muscles groaned in protest at being worked again so soon but he tried not to dwell on his fatigue The highstorms rains from the night before meant that most plants were still open rockbuds spewing out vines flowering branzahs reaching clawlike branches out of crevices toward the sky There were also occasional prickletacs the needly stonelimbed little shrubs Kaladin had noticed his first time through the area Water pooled in the numerous crevices and depressions on the surface of the uneven plateau Gaz called out directions telling them which pathway to take Many of the nearby plateaus had three or four bridges creating branching paths across the Plains The running became rote It was exhausting but it was also familiar and it was nice to be at the front where he could see where he was going Kaladin fell into his usual stepcounting mantra as hed been advised to do by that nameless bridgeman whose sandals he still wore Eventually they reached the last of the permanent bridges They crossed a short plateau passing the smoldering ruins of a bridge the Parshendi had destroyed during the night How had the Parshendi managed that during a highstorm Earlier while listening to the soldiers hed learned that the soldiers regarded the Parshendi with hatred anger and not a little awe These Parshendi werent like the lazy nearly mute parshmen who worked throughout Roshar These Parshendi were warriors of no small skill That still struck Kaladin as incongruous Parshmen Fighting It was just so strange Bridge Four and the other crews got their bridges down spanning a chasm where it was narrowest His men collapsed to the ground around their bridge relaxing while the army crossed Kaladin nearly joined themin fact his knees nearly buckled in anticipation No he thought steadying himself No I stand It was a foolish gesture The other bridgemen barely paid him any heed One man Moash even swore at him But now that Kaladin had made the decision he stubbornly stuck to it clasping his hands behind his back and falling into parade rest while watching the army cross Ho little bridgeman a soldier called from among those waiting their turn Curious at what real soldiers look like Kaladin turned toward the man a solid browneyed fellow with arms the size of many mens thighs He was a squadleader by the knots on the shoulder of his leather jerkin Kaladin had borne those knots once How do you treat your spear and shield squadleader Kaladin called back The man frowned but Kaladin knew what he was thinking A soldiers gear was his life you cared for your weapon as youd care for your children often seeing to its upkeep before you took food or rest Kaladin nodded to the bridge This is my bridge he said in a loud voice It is my weapon the only one allowed me Treat her well Or youll do what called one of the other soldiers prompting laughter among the ranks The squadleader said nothing He looked troubled Kaladins words were bravado In truth he hated the bridge Still he remained standing A few moments later Highprince Sadeas himself crossed on Kaladins bridge Brightlord Amaram had always seemed so heroic so distinguished A gentleman general This Sadeas was a different creature entirely with that round face curly hair and lofty expression He rode as if he were in a parade one hand lightly holding the reins before him the other carrying his helm under his arm His armor was painted red and the helm bore frivolous tassels There was so much pointless pomp that it nearly overshadowed the wonder of the ancient artifact Kaladin forgot his fatigue and formed his hands into fists Here was a lighteyes he could hate even more than most a man so callous that he threw away the lives of hundreds of bridgemen each month A man who had expressly forbidden his bridgemen to have shields for reasons Kaladin still didnt understand Sadeas and his honor guard soon passed and Kaladin realized that he probably should have bowed Sadeas hadnt noticed but it could have made trouble if he had Shaking his head Kaladin roused his bridge crew though it took special prodding to get Rockthe large Horneaterup and moving Once across the chasm his men picked up their bridge and jogged toward the next chasm The process was repeated enough times that Kaladin lost count At each crossing he refused to lie down He stood with hands behind his back watching the army pass More soldiers took note of him jeering Kaladin ignored them and by the fifth or sixth crossing the jeers faded The one other time he saw Brightlord Sadeas Kaladin gave a bow though it made his stomach twist to do so He did not serve this man He did not give this man allegiance But he did serve his men of Bridge Four He would save them and that meant he had to keep himself from being punished for insolence Reverse runners Gaz called Cross and reverse Kaladin turned sharply The next crossing would be the assault He squinted looking into the distance and could just barely make out a line of dark figures gathering on another plateau The Parshendi had arrived and were forming up Behind them a group worked on breaking open the chrysalis Kaladin felt a spike of frustration Their speed hadnt been enough Andtired though they wereSadeas would want to attack quickly before the Parshendi could get the gemheart out of its shell The bridgemen rose from their rest silent haunted They knew what was coming They crossed the chasm and pulled the bridge over then rearranged themselves in reverse order The soldiers formed ranks It was all so silent like men preparing to carry a casket to the pyre The bridgemen left a space for Kaladin at the back sheltered and protected Syl alighted on the bridge looking at the spot Kaladin walked up to it so tired mentally and physically Hed pushed himself too hard in the morning then again by standing instead of resting What had possessed him to do such a thing He could barely walk He looked over the bridgemen His men were resigned despondent terrified If they refused to run theyd be executed If they did run theyd face the arrows They didnt look toward the distant line of Parshendi archers Instead they looked down They are your men Kaladin told himself They need you to lead them even if they dont know it How can you lead from the rear He stepped out of line and rounded the bridge two of the menDrehy and Teftlooked up in shock as he passed The deathpointthe spot in the very center of the frontwas being held by Rock the beefy tanskinned Horneater Kaladin tapped him on the shoulder Youre in my spot Rock The man glanced at him surprised But To the back with you Rock frowned Nobody ever tried to jump ahead in the order Youre airsick lowlander he said with his thick accent You wish to die Why do you not just go leap into the chasm That would be easier Im bridgeleader Its my privilege to run at the front Go Rock shrugged but did as ordered taking Kaladins position at the back Nobody said a word If Kaladin wanted to get himself killed who were they to complain Kaladin looked over the bridgemen The longer we take to get this bridge down the more arrows they can loose at us Stay firm stay determined and be quick Raise bridge The men lifted inner rows moving underneath and situating themselves in rows of five across Kaladin stood at the very front with a tall stout man named Leyten to his left a spindly man named Murk to his right Adis and Corl were at the edges Five men in front The deathline Once all of the crews had their bridges up Gaz gave the command Assault They ran dashing alongside the standing ranks of the army passing soldiers holding spears and shields Some watched with curiosity perhaps amused at the sight of the lowly bridgemen running so urgently to their deaths Others looked away perhaps ashamed of the lives it would cost to get them across that chasm Kaladin kept his eyes forward squelching that incredulous voice in the back of his mind one that screamed he was doing something very stupid He barreled toward the final chasm focused on the Parshendi line Figures with black and crimson skin holding bows Syl flitted close to Kaladins head no longer in the form of a person streaking like a ribbon of light She zipped in front of him The bows came up Kaladin hadnt been at the deathpoint during a charge this bad since his first day on the crew They always put new men into rotation at the deathpoint That way if they died you didnt have to worry about training them The Parshendi archers drew aiming at five or six of the bridge crews Bridge Four was obviously in their sights The bows loosed Tien Kaladin screamed nearly mad with fatigue and frustration He bellowed the name alouduncertain whyas a wall of arrows zipped toward him Kaladin felt a jolt of energy a surge of sudden strength unanticipated and unexplained The arrows landed Murk fell without a sound four or five arrows striking him spraying his blood across the stones Leyten dropped as well and with him both Adis and Corl Shafts struck the ground at Kaladins feet shattering and a good half dozen hit the wood around Kaladins head and hands Kaladin didnt know if hed been hit He was too flush with energy and alarm He continued running screaming holding the bridge on his shoulders For some reason a group of Parshendi archers ahead lowered their bows He saw their marbled skin strange reddish or orange helms and simple brown clothing They appeared confused Whatever the reason it gained Bridge Four a few precious moments By the time the Parshendi raised their bows again Kaladins team had reached the chasm His men fell into line with the other bridge crewsthere were only fifteen bridges now Five had fallen They closed the gaps as they arrived Kaladin screamed for the bridgemen to drop amid another spray of arrows One sliced open the skin near his ribs deflecting off the bone He felt it hit but didnt feel any pain He scrambled around the side of the bridge helping push Kaladins team slammed the bridge into place as a wave of Alethi arrows distracted the enemy archers A troop of cavalry charged across the bridges The bridgemen were soon forgotten Kaladin fell to his knees beside the bridge as the others of his crew stumbled away bloodied and hurt their part in the battle over Kaladin held his side feeling the blood there Straight laceration only about an inch long not wide enough to be of danger It was his fathers voice Kaladin panted He needed to get to safety Arrows zipped over his head fired by the Alethi archers Some people take lives Other people save lives He wasnt done yet Kaladin forced himself to his feet and staggered to where someone lay beside the bridge It was a bridgeman named Hobber he had an arrow through the leg The man moaned holding his thigh Kaladin grabbed him under the arms and pulled him away from the bridge The man cursed at the pain dazed as Kaladin towed him to a cleft behind a small bulge in the rock where Rock and some of the other bridgemen had sought shelter After dropping off Hobberthe arrow hadnt hit any major arteries and he would be fine for a time yetKaladin turned and tried to rush back out onto the battlefield proper He slipped however stumbling in his fatigue He hit the ground hard grunting Some take lives Some save lives He pushed himself to his feet sweat dripping from his brow and scrambled back toward the bridge his fathers voice in his ears The next bridgeman he found a man named Koorm was dead Kaladin left the body Gadol had a deep wound in the side where an arrow had passed completely through him His face was covered with blood from a gash on his temple and hed managed to crawl a short distance from the bridge He looked up with frenzied black eyes orange painspren waving around him Kaladin grabbed him under the arms and towed him away just before a thundering charge of cavalry trampled the place where hed been lying Kaladin dragged Gadol over to the cleft noting two more dead He did a quick count That made twentynine bridgemen including the dead hed seen Five were missing Kaladin stumbled back out onto the battlefield Soldiers had bunched up around the back of the bridge archers forming at the sides and firing into the Parshendi lines as the heavy cavalry chargeled by Highprince Sadeas himself virtually indestructible in his Shardplatetried to push the enemy back Kaladin wavered dizzy dismayed at the sight of so many men running shouting firing arrows and throwing spears Five bridgemen probably dead lost in all of that He spotted a figure huddled just beside the chasm lip with arrows flying back and forth over his head It was Dabbid one of the bridgemen He curled up arm twisted at an awkward angle Kaladin charged in He threw himself to the ground and crawled beneath the zipping arrows hoping that the Parshendi would ignore a couple of unarmed bridgemen Dabbid didnt even notice when Kaladin reached him He was in shock lips moving soundlessly eyes dazed Kaladin grabbed him awkwardly afraid to stand up too high lest an arrow hit him He dragged Dabbid away from the edge in a clumsy half crawl He kept slipping on blood falling abrading his arms on the rock hitting his face against the stone He persisted towing the younger man out from underneath the flying arrows Finally he got far enough away that he risked standing He tried to pick up Dabbid But his muscles were so weak He strained and slipped exhausted falling to the stones He lay there gasping the pain of his side finally washing over him So tired He stood up shakily then tried again to grab Dabbid He blinked away tears of frustration too weak to even pull the man Airsick lowlander a voice growled Kaladin turned as Rock arrived The massive Horneater grabbed Dabbid under the arms pulling him Crazy he grumbled to Kaladin but easily lifted the wounded bridgeman and carried him back to the hollow Kaladin followed He collapsed in the hollow his back to the rock The surviving bridgemen huddled around him eyes haunted Rock set Dabbid down Four more Kaladin said between gasps We have to find them Murk and Leyten Teft said The older bridgeman had been near the back this run and hadnt taken any wounds And Adis and Corl They were in the front Thats right Kaladin thought exhausted How could I forget Murk is dead he said The others might live He tried to stumble to his feet Idiot Rock said Stay here Is all right I will do this thing He hesitated Guess Im an idiot too He scowled but went back out onto the battlefield Teft hesitated then chased after him Kaladin breathed in and out holding his side He couldnt decide if the pain of the arrow impact hurt more than the cut Save lives He crawled over to the three wounded Hobberwith an arrow through the legwould wait and Dabbid had only a broken arm Gadol was the worst off with that hole in his side Kaladin stared at the wound He didnt have an operating table he didnt even have antiseptic How was he supposed to do anything He shoved despair aside One of you go fetch me a knife he told the bridgemen Take it off the body of a soldier who has fallen Someone else build a fire The bridgemen looked at each other Dunny you get the knife Kaladin said as he held his hand to Gadols wound trying to stanch the blood Narm can you make a fire With what the man asked Kaladin pulled off his vest and shirt then handed the shirt to Narm Use this as tinder and gather some fallen arrows for wood Does anyone have flint and steel Moash did fortunately You carried anything valuable you had with you on a bridge run other bridgemen might steal it if you left it behind Move quickly Kaladin said Someone else go rip open a rockbud and get me the watergourd inside They stood for a few moments Then blessedly they did as he demanded Perhaps they were too stunned to object Kaladin tore open Gadols shirt exposing the wound It was bad terribly bad If it had cut the intestines or some of the other organs He ordered one of the bridgemen to hold a bandage to Gadols forehead to stanch the smaller blood flow thereanything would helpand inspected the wounded side with the speed his father had taught him Dunny returned quickly with a knife Narm was having trouble with the fire though The man cursed trying his flint and steel again Gadol was spasming Kaladin pressed bandages to the wound feeling helpless There wasnt a place he could make a tourniquet for a wound like this There wasnt anything he could do but Gadol spit up blood coughing They break the land itself he hissed eyes wild They want it but in their rage they will destroy it Like the jealous man burns his rich things rather than let them be taken by his enemies They come He gasped And then he fell still his dead eyes staring upward bloody spittle running in a trail down his cheek His final haunting words hung over them Not far away soldiers fought and screamed but the bridgemen were silent Kaladin sat back stunnedas alwaysby the pain of losing someone His father had always said that time would dull his sensitivity In this Lirin had been wrong He felt so tired Rock and Teft were hurrying back toward the cleft in the rock bearing a body between them They wouldnt have brought anyone unless he was still alive Kaladin told himself Think of the ones you can help Keep that fire going he said pointing at Narm Dont let it die Someone heat the blade in it Narm jumped noticing as if for the first time that hed actually managed to get a small flame started Kaladin turned away from the dead Gadol and made room for Rock and Teft They deposited a very bloody Leyten on the ground He was breathing shallowly and had two arrows sticking from him one from the shoulder the other from the opposite arm Another had grazed his stomach and the cut there had been widened by movement It looked like his left leg had been trampled by a horse it was broken and he had a large gash where the skin had split The other three are dead Teft said He nearly is too Nothing much we can do But you said to bring him so Kaladin knelt down immediately working with careful efficient speed He pressed a bandage against the side holding it in place with his knee then tied a quick bandage on the leg ordering one of the soldiers to hold it firm and elevate the limb Wheres that knife Kaladin yelled hurriedly tying a loose tourniquet around the arm He needed to stop the blood right now hed worry about saving the arm later Youthful Dunny rushed over with the heated blade Kaladin lifted the side bandage and quickly cauterized the wound there Leyten was unconscious his breathing growing more shallow You will not die Kaladin muttered You will not die His mind was numb but his fingers knew the motions For a moment he was back in his fathers surgery room listening to careful instruction He cut the arrow from Leytens arm but left the one in his shoulder then sent the knife back to be reheated Peet finally returned with the watergourd Kaladin snatched it using it to clean the leg wound which was the nastiest as it had been caused by trampling When the knife came back Kaladin pulled the arrow free of the shoulder and cauterized the wound as best he could then used another of his quickly disappearing bandages to tie the wound He splinted the leg with arrow shaftsthe only thing they had With a grimace he cauterized the wound there too He hated to cause so many scars but he couldnt afford to let any more blood be lost He was going to need antiseptic How soon could he get some of that mucus Dont you dare die Kaladin said barely conscious that he was speaking He quickly tied off the leg wound then used his needle and thread to sew the arm wound He bandaged it then untied the tourniquet most of the way Finally he settled back looking at the wounded man completely drained Leyten was still breathing How long would that last The odds were against him The bridgemen stood or sat around Kaladin looking strangely reverent Kaladin tiredly moved over to Hobber and saw to the mans leg wound It didnt need to be cauterized Kaladin washed it out cut away some splinters then sewed it There were painspren all around the man tiny orange hands stretching up from the ground Kaladin sliced off the cleanest portion of bandage hed used on Gadol and tied it around Hobbers wound He hated the uncleanliness of it but there was no other choice Then he set Dabbids arm with some arrows he had the other bridgemen fetch using Dabbids shirt to tie them in place Then finally Kaladin sat back against the lip of stone letting out a long fatigued breath Bangs of metal on metal and shouts of soldiers rang from behind He felt so tired Too tired to even close his eyes He just wanted to sit and stare at the ground forever Teft settled down beside him The grizzled man had the watergourd which still had some liquid in the bottom Drink lad You need it We should clean the wounds of the other men Kaladin said numbly They took scrapesI saw some had cutsand they should Drink Teft said his crackly voice insistent Kaladin hesitated then drank the water It tasted strongly bitter like the plant from which it had been taken Whered you learn to heal men like that Teft asked Several of the nearby bridgemen turned toward him at the question I wasnt always a slave Kaladin whispered These things you did they wont make a difference Rock said walking up The massive Horneater squatted down Gaz makes us leave behind wounded who can not walk Is standing order from above Ill deal with Gaz Kaladin said resting his head back against the stone Go return that knife to the body you took it off I dont want to be accused of thievery Then when the time comes to leave I want two men in charge of Leyten and two men in charge of Hobber Well tie them to the top of the bridge and carry them At the chasms youll have to move quickly and untie them before the army crosses then retie them at the end Well also need someone to lead Dabbid if his shock hasnt passed Gaz wont stand for this thing Rock said Kaladin closed his eyes declining further argument The battle was a long one As evening approached the Parshendi finally retreated jumping away across the chasms with their unnaturally powerful legs There was a chorus of shouts from the Alethi soldiers who had won the day Kaladin forced himself to his feet and went looking for Gaz It would be a while yet before they could get the chrysalis openit was like pounding on stonebut he needed to deal with the bridge sergeant He found Gaz watching from well behind the battle lines He glanced at Kaladin with his one eye How much of that blood is yours Kaladin looked down realizing for the first time that he was crusted with dark flaking blood most belonging to the men hed worked on He didnt answer the question Were taking our wounded with us Gaz shook his head If they cant walk they stay behind Standing orders Not my choice Were taking them Kaladin said no more firm no more loud Brightlord Lamaril wont stand for it Lamaril was Gazs immediate superior Youll send Bridge Four last to lead the wounded soldiers back to camp Lamaril wont go with that troop hell go on ahead with the main body as he wont want to miss Sadeass victory feast Gaz opened his mouth My men will move quickly and efficiently Kaladin said interrupting him They wont slow anyone He took the last sphere from his pocket and handed it over You wont say anything Gaz took the sphere snorting One clearmark You think that will make me take a risk this big If you dont Kaladin said voice calm I will kill you and let them execute me Gaz blinked in surprise Youd never Kaladin took a single step forward He must have looked a dreadful sight covered in blood Gaz paled Then he cursed holding up the dark sphere And a dun sphere at that Kaladin frowned He was sure it had still glowed before the bridge run Thats your fault You gave it to me Those spheres were newly infused last night Gaz said They came straight from Brightlord Sadeass treasurer What did you do with them Kaladin shook his head too exhausted to think Syl landed on his shoulder as he turned to walk back to the bridgemen What are they to you Gaz called after him Why do you even care Theyre my men He left Gaz behind I dont trust him Syl said looking over her shoulder He could just say you threatened him and send men to arrest you Maybe he will Kaladin said I guess I just have to count on him wanting more of my bribes Kaladin continued on listening to the shouts of the victors and the groans of their wounded The plateaus were littered with corpses bunched up along the edges of the chasm where the bridges had made a focus for the battle The Parshendias alwayshad left their dead behind Even when they won they reportedly left their dead The humans sent back bridge crews and soldiers to burn their dead and send their spirits to the afterlife where the best among them would fight in the Heralds army Spheres Syl said still looking at Gaz That doesnt seem like much to count on Maybe Maybe not Ive seen the way he looks at them He wants the money I give him Perhaps badly enough to keep him in line Kaladin shook his head What you said earlier is right men are unreliable in many things But if theres one thing you can count on its their greed It was a bitter thought But it had been a bitter day A hopeful bright beginning and a bloody red sunset Just like every day Map of Alethi warcamps by the painter Vandonas who visited the warcamps once and painted perhaps an idealized representation of them Ati was once a kind and generous man and you saw what became of him Rayse on the other hand was among the most loathsome crafty and dangerous individuals I had ever met Yeah this was cut the portly leatherworker said holding up the straps as Adolin watched Wouldnt you agree Yis The other leatherworker nodded Yis was a yelloweyed Iriali with stark golden hair Not blond golden There was even a metallic sheen to it He kept it short and wore a cap Obviously he didnt want to draw attention to it Many considered a lock of Iriali hair to be a ward of good luck His companion Avaran was an Alethi darkeyes who wore an apron over his vest If the two men worked in the traditional way one would labor on the larger more robust pieceslike saddleswhile the other specialized in fine detail A group of apprentices toiled in the background cutting or sewing hogshide Sliced Yis agreed taking the straps from Avaran I concur Well hie me to Damnation Adolin muttered You mean Elhokar was actually right Adolin a feminine voice said from behind You said wed be going on a walk Thats what were doing he said turning to smile Janala stood with arms folded wearing a sleek yellow dress of impeccable fashion buttoning up the sides cupping around the neck with a stiff collar embroidered with crimson thread I had imagined she said that a walk would involve more walking Hm he said Yes Well be getting right to that soon Itll be grand Lots of prancing sauntering and er Promenading Yis the leatherworker offered Isnt that a type of drink Adolin asked Er no Brightlord Im fairly certain its another word for walking Well then Adolin said Well do plenty of it too Promenading I always love a good promenading He rubbed his chin taking the strap back How certain are you about this strap Theres really no room for question Brightlord Avaran said Thats not a simple tear You should be more careful Careful Yes Avaran said Make sure that no loose buckles are scraping the leather cutting into it This looks like it came from a saddle Sometimes people let the girth straps hang down when setting the saddle for the night and they get pinched underneath something Id guess that caused the slice Oh Adolin said You mean it wasnt cut intentionally Well it could have been that Avaran said But why would someone cut a girth like this Why indeed Adolin thought He bid farewell to the two leatherworkers tucked the strap into his pocket then held out his elbow to Janala She took it with her freehand obviously happy to finally be free of the leatherworking shop It had a faint odor about it though not nearly as bad as a tannery Hed seen her reaching for her handkerchief a few times acting as if she wanted to hold it up to her nose They stepped out into the midday sunlight Tibon and Markstwo lighteyed members of the Cobalt Guardwaited outside with Janalas handmaiden Falksi who was a young Azish darkeyes The three fell into step behind Adolin and Janala as they walked out onto the street of the warcamp Falksi muttering under her breath in an accented voice about the lack of a proper palanquin for her mistress Janala didnt seem to mind She breathed deeply of the open air and clung to his arm She was quite beautiful even if she did like to talk about herself Talkativeness was normally an attribute he was fond of in a woman but today he had trouble paying attention as Janala began telling him about the latest court gossip The strap had been cut but the leatherworkers had both assumed that it was the result of an accident That implied theyd seen cuts like this before A loose buckle or other mishap slicing the leather Except this time that cut had thrown the king in the middle of a fight Could there be something to it wouldnt you say Adolin Janala asked Undoubtedly he said listening with half an ear So youll talk to him Hum Your father Youll ask him about letting the men abandon that dreadfully unfashionable uniform once in a while Well hes rather set on the idea Adolin said Besides its really not that unfashionable Janala gave him a flat stare All right he admitted It is a little drab Like every other highranked lighteyed officer in Dalinars army Adolin wore a simple blue outfit of militaristic cut A long coat of solid blueno embroideryand stiff trousers in a time when vests silk accents and scarves were the fashion His fathers Kholin glyphpair was emblazoned quite obtrusively on the back and breast and the front fastened with silver buttons up both sides It was simple distinctly recognizable but awfully plain Your fathers men love him Adolin Janala said But his requirements are growing tiresome I know Trust me But I dont think I can change his mind How to explain Despite six years at war Dalinar wasnt weakening in his resolve to hold to the Codes If anything his dedication to them was strengthening At least now Adolin understood somewhat Dalinars beloved brother had made one last request Follow the Codes True that request had been in reference to a single event but Adolins father was known to take things to extremes Adolin just wished he wouldnt make the same requirement of everyone else Individually the Codes were only minor inconveniencesalways be in uniform when in public never be drunken avoid dueling In aggregate however they were burdensome His response to Janala was cut off as a set of horns blared through the camp Adolin perked up spinning looking eastward toward the Shattered Plains He counted off the next series of horns A chrysalis had been spotted on plateau onefortyseven That was within striking distance He held his breath waiting for a third series of horns to blare calling Dalinars armies to battle That would only happen if his father ordered it Part of him knew those horns wouldnt come Onefortyseven was close enough to Sadeass warcamp that the other highprince would certainly try for it Come on Father Adolin thought We can race him for it No horns came Adolin glanced at Janala Shed chosen music as her Calling and paid little attention to the war though her father was one of Dalinars cavalry officers From her expression Adolin could tell that even she understood what the lack of a third horn meant Once again Dalinar Kholin had chosen not to fight Come on Adolin said turning and moving in another direction practically towing Janala along by her elbow Theres something else I want to check into Dalinar stood with hands clasped behind his back looking out over the Shattered Plains He was on one of the lower terraces outside Elhokars elevated palacethe king didnt reside in one of the ten warcamps but in a small compound elevated along a hillside nearby Dalinars climb to the palace had been interrupted by the horns He stood long enough see Sadeass army gathering inside his camp Dalinar could have sent a soldier to prepare his own men He was close enough Brightlord a voice asked from the side Do you wish to continue You protect him your way Sadeas Dalinar thought Ill protect him my way Yes Teshav he said turning to continue walking up the switchbacks Teshav joined him She had streaks of blond in her otherwise black Alethi hair which she wore up in an intricate crossing weave She had violet eyes and her pinched face bore a concerned expression That was normal she always seemed to need something to worry about Teshav and her attendant scribe were both wives of his officers Dalinar trusted them Mostly It was hard to trust anyone completely Stop it he thought Youre starting to sound as paranoid as the king Regardless hed be very glad for Jasnahs return If she ever decided to return Some of his higher officers hinted to him that he should marry again if only to have a woman who could be his primary scribe They thought he rejected their suggestions because of love for his first wife They didnt know that she was gone vanished from his mind a blank patch of fog in his memory Though in a way his officers were right He hesitated to remarry because he hated the idea of replacing her Hed had everything of his wife taken from him All that remained was the hole and filling it to gain a scribe seemed callous Dalinar continued on his way Other than the two women he was attended by Renarin and three members of the Cobalt Guard The latter wore deep blue felt caps and cloaks over silvery breastplates and deep blue trousers They were lighteyes of low rank able to carry swords for close fighting Well Brightlord Teshav said Brightlord Adolin asked me to report the progress of the saddle girth investigation Hes speaking with leatherworkers at this very moment but so far there is very little to say Nobody witnessed anyone interfering with the saddle or His Majestys horse Our spies say there are no whispers of anyone in the other warcamps bragging and nobody in our camp has suddenly received large sums of money so far as weve discovered The grooms Say they checked over the saddle she said but when pressed they admit that they cant specifically remember checking the girth She shook her head Carrying a Shardbearer places great strain on both horse and saddle If there were only some way to tame more Ryshadium I think youll sooner tame the highstorms Brightness Well this is good news I suppose Better for us all that this strap business turns out to be nothing Now there is another item I wish you to look into It is my pleasure to serve Brightlord Highprince Aladar has begun to talk of taking a short vacation back to Alethkar I want to know if hes serious Yes Brightlord Teshav nodded Would that be a problem Im honestly not sure He didnt trust the highprinces but at least with them all here he could watch them If one of them returned to Alethkar the man could scheme unchecked Of course even brief visits might help stabilize their homeland Which was more important Stability or the ability to watch over the others Blood of my fathers he thought I wasnt made for this politicking and scheming I was made to wield a sword and ride down enemies Hed do what needed to be done anyway I believe you said you had information on the kings accounts Teshav Indeed she said as they continued the short hike You were correct to have me look into the ledgers as it appears that three of the highprincesThanadal Hatham and Vamahare well behind in their payments Other than yourself only Highprince Sadeas has actually paid ahead on what is owed as the tenets of war require Dalinar nodded The longer this war stretches the more comfortable the highprinces are getting Theyre starting to question Why pay high war time rates for Soulcasting Why not move farmers out here and start growing their own food Pardon Brightlord Teshav said as they turned around a switchback Her attendant scribe walked behind several ledgers clipped to boards carried in a satchel But do we really wish to discourage that A second stream of supplies could be valuable as a redundancy The merchants already provide redundancy Dalinar said Which is one of the reasons I havent chased them off I wouldnt mind another but the Soulcasters are the only hold we have on the highprinces They owed Gavilar loyalty but they feel little of that for his son Dalinar narrowed his eyes This is a vital point Teshav Have you read the histories I suggested Yes Brightlord Then you know The most fragile period in a kingdoms existence comes during the lifetime of its founders heir During the reign of a man like Gavilar men stay loyal because of their respect for him During subsequent generations men begin to see themselves as part of a kingdom a united force that holds together because of tradition But the sons reignthats the dangerous point Gavilar isnt here to hold everyone together but there isnt yet a tradition of Alethkar being a kingdom Weve got to carry on long enough for the highprinces to begin seeing themselves as part of a greater whole Yes Brightlord She didnt question Teshav was deeply loyal to him as were most of his officers They didnt question why it was so important to him that the ten princedoms regard themselves as one nation Perhaps they assumed it was because of Gavilar Indeed his brothers dream of a united Alethkar was part of it There was something else though The Everstorm comes The True Desolation The Night of Sorrows He suppressed a shiver The visions certainly didnt make it sound like he had a great deal of time to prepare Draft a missive in the kings name Dalinar said decreasing Soulcasting costs for those who have made their payments on time That should wake up the others Give it to Elhokars scribes and have them explain it to him Hopefully he will agree with the need Yes Brightlord Teshav said If I might note I was quite surprised that you suggested I read those histories In the past such things havent been particular to your interests I do a lot of things lately that arent particular to my interests or my talents Dalinar said with a grimace My lack of capacity doesnt change the kingdoms needs Have you gathered reports of banditry in the area Yes Brightlord She hesitated The rates are quite alarming Tell your husband I give him command of the Fourth Battalion Dalinar said I want the two of you to work out a better pattern of patrol in the Unclaimed Hills So long as the Alethi monarchy has a presence here I do not want it to be a land of lawlessness Yes Brightlord Teshav said sounding hesitant You realize that means youve committed two entire battalions to patrolling Yes Dalinar said He had asked for help from the other highprinces Their reactions had ranged from shock to mirth None had given him any soldiers That is added to the battalion you assigned to peacekeeping in the areas between warcamps and the exterior merchant markets Teshav added In total thats over a quarter of your forces here Brightlord The orders stand Teshav he said See to it But first I have more to discuss with you regarding the ledgers Go on ahead to the ledger room and wait for us there She nodded respect Of course Brightlord She withdrew with her ward Renarin stepped up to Dalinar She wasnt pleased about that Father She wishes her husband to be fighting Dalinar said They all hope that Ill win another Shardblade out there then give it to them The Parshendi had Shards Not many but even a single one was surprising Nobody had an explanation for where theyd gotten them Dalinar had won a Parshendi Shardblade and Plate during his first year here Hed given both to Elhokar to award to a warrior he felt would be the most useful to Alethkar and the war effort Dalinar turned and entered the palace proper The guards at the doorway saluted him and Renarin The young man kept his eyes forward staring at nothing Some people thought him emotionless but Dalinar knew he was just preoccupied Ive been meaning to speak with you son Dalinar said About the hunt last week Renarins eyes flickered downward in shame the edges of his mouth pulling back in a grimace Yes he did have emotions He just didnt show them as often as others You realize that you shouldnt have rushed into battle as you did Dalinar said sternly That chasmfiend could have killed you What would you have done Father if it had been me in danger I dont fault your bravery I fault your wisdom What if youd had one of your fits Then perhaps the monster would have swept me off the plateau Renarin said bitterly and I would no longer be such a useless drain on everyones time Dont say such things Not even in jest Was it jest Father I cant fight Fighting is not the only thing of value a man can do The ardents were very specific about that Yes the highest Calling of men was to join the battle in the afterlife to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls but the Almighty accepted the excellence of any man or woman regardless of what they did You just did your best picking a profession and an attribute of the Almighty to emulate A Calling and a Glory it was said You worked hard at your profession and you spent your life trying to live according to a single ideal The Almighty would accept that particularly if you were lighteyedthe better your blood as a lighteyes the more innate Glory you had already Dalinars Calling was to be a leader and his chosen Glory was determination Hed chosen both in his youth though he now viewed them very differently than he once had You are right of course Father Renarin said I am not the first heros son to be born without any talent for warfare The others all got along So shall I Likely I will end up as citylord of a small town Assuming I dont tuck myself away in the devotaries The boys eyes turned forward I still think of him as the boy Dalinar thought Even though hes now in his twentieth year Wit had been right Dalinar underestimated Renarin How would I react if I were forbidden to fight Kept back with the women and the merchants Dalinar would have been bitter particularly against Adolin In fact Dalinar had often been envious of Gavilar during their boyhood Renarin however was Adolins greatest supporter He all but worshipped his elder brother And he was brave enough to dash heedless into the middle of a battlefield where a nightmare creature was smashing spearmen and tossing aside Shardbearers Dalinar cleared his throat Perhaps it is time to again try training you in the sword My blood weakness Wont matter a bit if we get you into a set of Plate and give you a Blade Dalinar said The armor makes any man strong and a Shardblade is nearly as light as air itself Father Renarin said flatly Ill never be a Shardbearer You yourself have said that the Blades and Plate we win from the Parshendi must go to the most skilled warriors None of the other highprinces give up their spoils to the king Dalinar said And who would fault me if for once I made a gift to my son Renarin stopped in the hallway displaying an unusual level of emotion eyes opening wider face eager You are serious I give you my oath son If I can capture another Blade and Plate they will go to you He smiled To be honest Id do it simply for the joy of seeing Sadeass face when you become a full Shardbearer Beyond that if your strength is made equal to others I expect that your natural skill will make you shine Renarin smiled Shardplate wouldnt solve everything but Renarin would have his chance Dalinar would see to it I know what its like to be a second son he thought as they continued walking toward the kings chambers overshadowed by an older brother you love yet envy at the same time Stormfather but I do I still feel that way Ah good Brightlord Adolin the ardent said walking forward with open arms Kadash was a tall man in his later years and wore the shaved head and square beard of his Calling He also had a twisting scar that ran around the top of his head a memento from his earlier days as an army officer It was uncommon to find a man such as hima lighteyes who had once been a soldierin the ardentia In fact it was odd for any man to change his Calling But it wasnt forbidden and Kadash had risen far in the ardentia considering his late start Dalinar said it was a sign of either faith or perseverance Perhaps both The warcamps temple had started as a large Soulcast dome then Dalinar had granted money and stonemasons to transform it into a more suitable house of worship Carvings of the Heralds now lined the inside walls and broad windows carved on the leeward side had been set with glass to let in the light Diamond spheres blazed in bunches hung from the high ceiling and stands had been set up for the instruction practice and testing of the various arts Many women were in at the moment receiving instruction from the ardents There were fewer men Being at war it was easy to practice the masculine arts in the field Janala folded her arms scanning the temple with obvious dissatisfaction as she stood beside Adolin First a stinky leatherworkers shop now the temple I had assumed we would walk someplace at least faintly romantic Religions romantic Adolin said scratching his head Eternal love and all that right She eyed him Im going to go wait outside She turned and walked out with her handmaiden And someone get me a storming palanquin Adolin frowned watching her go Ill have to buy her something quite expensive to make up for this I suspect I dont see what the problem is Kadash said I think religion is romantic Youre an ardent Adolin said flatly Besides that scar makes you a little too unsightly for my tastes He sighed Its not so much the temple that has set her off but my lack of attention I havent been a very good companion today You have matters pressing upon your mind bright one Kadash asked Is this about your Calling You havent made much progress lately Adolin grimaced His chosen Calling was dueling By working with the ardents to make personal goals and fulfill them he could prove himself to the Almighty Unfortunately during war the Codes said Adolin was supposed to limit his duels as frivolous dueling could wound officers who might be needed in battle But Adolins father avoided battle more and more So what was the point of not dueling Holy one Adolin said we need to speak somewhere we cant be overheard Kadash raised an eyebrow and led Adolin around the central apex Vorin temples were always circular with a gently sloping mound at the center by custom rising ten feet high The building was dedicated to the Almighty maintained by Dalinar and the ardents he owned All devotaries were welcome to use it though most would have their own chapter houses in one of the warcamps What is it you wish to ask of me bright one the ardent asked once they reached a more secluded section of the vast chamber Kadash was deferential though he had tutored and trained Adolin during his childhood Is my father going mad Adolin asked Or could he really be seeing visions sent by the Almighty as I think he believes Thats a rather blunt question Youve known him longer than most Kadash and I know you to be loyal I also know you to be one who keeps his ears open and notices things so Im sure youve heard the rumors Adolin shrugged Seems like a time for bluntness if there ever was one I take it then the rumors are not unfounded Unfortunately no It happens during every highstorm He raves and thrashes about and afterward claims to have seen things What sorts of things Im not certain precisely Adolin grimaced Things about the Radiants And perhapsabout what is to come Kadash looked disturbed This is dangerous territory bright one What you are asking me about risks tempting me to violate my oaths I am an ardent owned by and loyal to your father But he is not your religious superior No But he is the Almightys guardian of this people set to watch me and make certain I dont rise above my station Kadash pursed his lips It is a delicate balance we walk bright one Do you know much of the Hierocracy the War of Loss The church tried to seize control Adolin said shrugging The priests tried to conquer the worldfor its own good they claimed That was part of it Kadash said The part we speak of most often But the problem goes much deeper The church back then it clung to knowledge Men were not in command of their own religious paths the priests controlled the doctrine and few members of the Church were allowed to know theology They were taught to follow the priests Not the Almighty or the Heralds but the priests He began walking leading Adolin around the back rim of the temple chamber They passed statues of the Heralds five male five female In truth Adolin knew very little of what Kadash was saying Hed never had much of a mind for history that didnt relate directly to the command of armies The problem bright one Kadash said was mysticism The priests claimed that common men could not understand religion or the Almighty Where there should have been openness there was smoke and whispers The priests began to claim visions and prophecies though such things had been denounced by the Heralds themselves Voidbinding is a dark and evil thing and the soul of it was to try to divine the future Adolin froze Wait youre saying Dont get ahead of me please bright one Kadash assured turning back toward him When the priests of the Hierocracy were cast down the Sunmaker made a point of interrogating them and going through their correspondences with one another It was discovered that there had been no prophecies No mystical promises from the Almighty That had all been an excuse fabricated by the priests to placate and control the people Adolin frowned Where are you going with this Kadash As close as I dare to the truth bright one the ardent said As I can not be as blunt as you You think my fathers visions are fabrications then I would never accuse my highprince of lying Kadash said Or even of feebleness But neither can I condone mysticism or prophecy in any form To do so would be to deny Vorinism The days of the priests are gone The days of lying to the people of keeping them in darkness are gone Now each man chooses his own path and the ardents help him achieve closeness to the Almighty through it Instead of shadowed prophecies and pretend powers held by a few we have a population who understand their beliefs and their relationship with their God He stepped closer speaking very softly Your father is not to be mocked or diminished If his visions are true then it is between him and the Almighty All I can say is this I know something of what it is to be haunted by the death and destruction of war I see in your fathers eyes much of what I have felt but worse My personal opinion is that the things he sees are likely more a reflection of his past than any mystical experience So he is going mad Adolin whispered I did not say that You implied that the Almighty probably wouldnt send visions like these I did And that his visions are a product of his own mind Likely so the ardent said raising his finger A delicate balance you see One that is particularly difficult to keep when speaking to my highprinces own son He reached out taking Adolins arm If any are to help him it must be you It would not be the place of any other even myself Adolin nodded slowly Thank you You should likely go see to that young woman now Yes Adolin said with a sigh I fear that even with the right gift she and I are not long for courting Renarin will mock me again Kadash smiled Best not to give up so easily bright one Go now But do return sometime so we can speak of your goals in regard to your Calling It has been too long since youve Elevated Adolin nodded and hurried from the chamber After hours going over the ledgers with Teshav Dalinar and Renarin reached the hallway before the kings chambers They walked in silence the soles of their boots clapping the marble flooring the sound echoing against stone walls The corridors of the kings war palace were growing richer by the week Once this hallway had been just another Soulcast stone tunnel As Elhokar settled in he had ordered improvements Windows were cut into the leeward side Marble tiling was set into the floor The walls were carved with reliefs with mosaic trim at the corners Dalinar and Renarin passed a group of stonemasons carefully cutting a scene of NalanElin emitting sunlight the sword of retribution held over his head They reached the kings antechamber a large open room guarded by ten members of the Kings Guard dressed in blue and gold Dalinar recognized each face he had personally organized the unit handpicking its members Highprince Ruthar waited to see the king He had brawny arms folded in front of him and wore a short black beard that surrounded his mouth The red silk coat was cut short and did not button almost more of a sleeved vest it was a mere token nod to traditional Alethi uniform The shirt underneath was ruffled and white and his blue trousers were loose with wide cuffs Ruthar glanced Dalinars way and nodded to hima minor token of respectthen turned to chat with one of his attendants He cut off however as the guards at the doorway stepped aside to let Dalinar enter Ruthar sniffed in annoyance Dalinars easy access to the king galled the other highprinces The king wasnt in his wardroom but the wide doors to his balcony were open Dalinars guardsmen waited behind as he stepped out onto the balcony Renarin hesitantly following The light outside was dimming as sunset neared Setting the war palace up high like this was tactically sound but it meant the place was mercilessly buffeted by storms That was an old campaign conundrum Did one choose the best position to weather storms or did one seize the high ground Most would have chosen the former their warcamps on the edge of the Shattered Plains were unlikely to be attacked making the advantage of the high ground less important But kings tended to prefer height In this instance Dalinar had encouraged Elhokar just in case The balcony itself was a thick platform of rock cut onto the top of the small peak edged with an iron railing The kings rooms were a Soulcast dome sitting atop the natural formation with covered ramps and stairways leading to tiers lower on the hillside Those housed the kings various attendants guards stormwardens ardents and distant family members Dalinar had his own bunker at his warcamp He refused to call it a palace The king leaned against the railing two guards watching from a distance Dalinar motioned for Renarin to join them so that he could speak with the king in private The air was coolspring having come for a timeand it was sweet with the scents of evening blooming rockbuds and wet stone Below the warcamps were starting to come alight ten sparkling circles filled with watchfires cook fires lamps and the steady glow of infused gems Elhokar stared over the camps and toward the Shattered Plains They were utterly dark save for the occasional twinkle of a watchpost Do they watch us from out there Elhokar asked as Dalinar joined him We know their raiding bands move at night Your Majesty Dalinar said resting one hand on the iron railing I cant help but think they watch us The kings uniform had the traditional long coat with buttons up the sides but it was loose and relaxed and ruffled lace poked out of the collar and cuffs His trousers were solid blue and were cut in the same baggy fashion as Ruthars It all looked so informal to Dalinar Increasingly their soldiers were being led by a slack group who dressed in lace and spent their evenings at feasts This is what Gavilar foresaw Dalinar thought This is why he grew so insistent that we follow the Codes You look thoughtful Uncle Elhokar said Just considering the past Your Majesty The past is irrelevant I only look forward Dalinar was not certain he agreed with either statement I sometimes think I should be able to see the Parshendi Elhokar said I feel that if I stare long enough I will find them pin them down so I can challenge them I wish theyd just fight me like men of honor If they were men of honor Dalinar said clasping his hands behind his back then they would not have killed your father as they did Why did they do it do you suppose Dalinar shook his head That question has churned in my head over and over like a boulder tumbling down a hill Did we off end their honor Was it some cultural misunderstanding A cultural misunderstanding would imply that they have a culture Primitive brutes Who knows why a horse kicks or an axehound bites I shouldnt have asked Dalinar didnt reply Hed felt that same disdain that same anger in the months following Gavilars assassination He could understand Elhokars desire to dismiss these strange wildland parshmen as little more than animals But hed seen them during those early days Interacted with them They were primitive yes but not brutes Not stupid We never really understood them he thought I guess thats the crux of the problem Elhokar he said softly It may be time to ask ourselves some difficult questions Such as Such as how long we will continue this war Elhokar started He turned looking at Dalinar Well keep fighting until the Vengeance Pact is satisfied and my father is avenged Noble words Dalinar said But weve been away from Alethkar for six years now Maintaining two farflung centers of government is not healthy for the kingdom Kings often go to war for extended periods Uncle Rarely do they do it for so long Dalinar said and rarely do they bring every Shardbearer and Highprince in the kingdom with them Our resources are strained and word from home is that the Reshi border encroachments grow increasingly bold We are still fragmented as a people slow to trust one another and the nature of this extended warwithout a clear path to victory and with a focus on riches rather than capturing groundis not helping at all Elhokar sniffed wind blowing at them atop the peaked rock You say theres no clear path to victory Weve been winning The Parshendi raids are coming less frequently and arent striking as far westward as they once did Weve killed thousands of them in battle Not enough Dalinar said They still come in strength The siege is straining us as much as or more than it is them Werent you the one to suggest this tactic in the first place I was a different man then flush with grief and anger And you no longer feel those things Elhokar was incredulous Uncle I cant believe Im hearing this You arent seriously suggesting that I abandon the war are you Youd have me slink home like a scolded axehound I said they were difficult questions Your Majesty Dalinar said keeping his anger in check It was taxing But they must be considered Elhokar breathed out annoyed Its true what Sadeas and the others whisper Youre changing Uncle It has something to do with those episodes of yours doesnt it They are unimportant Elhokar Listen to me What are we willing to give in order to get vengeance Anything And if that means everything your father worked for Do we honor his memory by undermining his vision for Alethkar all to get revenge in his name The king hesitated You pursue the Parshendi Dalinar said That is laudable But you cant let your passion for just retribution blind you to the needs of our kingdom The Vengeance Pact has kept the highprinces channeled but what will happen once we win Will we shatter I think we need to forge them together to unite them We fight this war as if we were ten different nations fighting beside one another but not with one another The king didnt respond immediately The words finally seemed to be sinking in He was a good man and shared more with his father than others chose to admit He turned away from Dalinar leaning against the railing You think Im a poor king dont you Uncle What Of course not You always talk about what I should be doing and where I am lacking Tell me truthfully Uncle When you look at me do you wish you saw my fathers face instead Of course I do Dalinar said Elhokars expression darkened Dalinar laid a hand on his nephews shoulder Id be a poor brother if I didnt wish that Gavilar had lived I failed himit was the greatest most terrible failure of my life Elhokar turned to him and Dalinar held his gaze raising a finger But just because I loved your father does not mean that I think you are a failure Nor does it mean I do not love you in your own right Alethkar itself could have collapsed upon Gavilars death but you organized and executed our counterattack You are a fine king The king nodded slowly Youve been listening to readings from that book again havent you I have You sound like him you know Elhokar said turning back to look eastward again Near the end When he began to acterratically Surely Im not so bad as that Perhaps But this is much like how he was Talking about an end to war fascinated by the Lost Radiants insisting everyone follow the Codes Dalinar remembered those daysand his own arguments with Gavilar What honor can we find on a battlefield while our people starve the king had once asked him Is it honor when our lighteyes plot and scheme like eels in a bucket slithering over one another and trying to bite each others tails Dalinar had reacted poorly to his words Just as Elhokar was reacting to his words now Stormfather I am starting to sound like him arent I That was troubling yet somehow encouraging at the same time Either way Dalinar realized something Adolin was right Elhokarand the highprinces with himwould never respond to a suggestion that they retreat Dalinar was approaching the conversation in the wrong way Almighty be blessed for sending me a son willing to speak his mind Perhaps you are right Your Majesty Dalinar said End the war Leave a battlefield with an enemy still in control That would shame us Elhokar nodded in agreement Im glad you see sense But something does have to change We need a better way to fight Sadeas has a better way already I spoke of his bridges to you They work so well and hes captured so many gemhearts Gemhearts are meaningless Dalinar said All of this is meaningless if we dont find a way to get the vengeance we all want You cant tell me you enjoy watching the highprinces squabble practically ignoring our real purpose in being here Elhokar fell silent looking displeased Unite them He remembered those words booming in his head Elhokar he said an idea occurring to him Do you remember what Sadeas and I spoke of to you when we first came here to war The specialization of the highprinces Yes Elhokar said In the distant past each of the ten highprinces in Alethkar had been given a specific charge for the governing of the kingdom One had been the ultimate law in regard to merchants and his troops had patrolled the roadways of all ten princedoms Another had administrated judges and magistrates Gavilar had been very taken by the idea He claimed it was a clever device meant to force the highprinces to work together Once this system had forced them to submit to one anothers authority Things hadnt been done that way in centuries ever since the fragmenting of Alethkar into ten autonomous princedoms Elhokar what if you named me Highprince of War Dalinar asked Elhokar didnt laugh that was a good sign I thought you and Sadeas decided that the others would revolt if we tried something like that Perhaps I was wrong about that too Elhokar appeared to consider it Finally the king shook his head No They barely accept my leadership If I did something like this theyd assassinate me Id protect you Bah You dont even take the present threats on my life seriously Dalinar sighed Your Majesty I do take threats to your life seriously My scribes and attendants are looking into the strap And what have they discovered Well so far we have nothing conclusive Nobody has taken credit for trying to kill you even in rumor Nobody saw anything suspicious But Adolin is speaking with leatherworkers Perhaps hell bring something more substantial It was cut Uncle We will see You dont believe me Elhokar said face growing red You should be trying to find out what the assassins plan was rather than pestering me with some arrogant quest to become overlord of the entire army Dalinar gritted his teeth I do this for you Elhokar Elhokar met his eyes for a moment and his blue eyes flashed with suspicion again as they had the week before Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought Hes getting worse Elhokars expression softened a moment later and he seemed to relax Whatever hed seen in Dalinars eyes had comforted him I know you try for the best Uncle Elhokar said But you have to admit that youve been erratic lately The way you react to storms your infatuation with my fathers last words Im trying to understand him He grew weak at the end Elhokar said Everyone knows it I wont repeat his mistakes and you should avoid them as wellrather than listening to a book that claims that lighteyes should be the slaves of the darkeyes Thats not what it says Dalinar said It has been misinterpreted Its mostly just a collection of stories which teach that a leader should serve those he leads Bah It was written by the Lost Radiants They didnt write it It was their inspiration Nohadon an ordinary man was its author Elhokar glanced at him raising an eyebrow See it seemed to say You defend it You are growing weak Uncle I will not exploit that weakness But others will I am not getting weak Yet again Dalinar forced himself to be calm This conversation has gone off the path The highprinces need a single leader to force them to work together I vow that if you name me Highprince of War I will see you protected As you saw my father protected Dalinars mouth snapped shut Elhokar turned away I should not have said that It was uncalled for No Dalinar said No it was one of the truest things you have said to me Elhokar Perhaps you are right to distrust my protection Elhokar glanced at him curious Why do you react that way What way Once if someone had said that to you youd have summoned your Blade and demanded a duel Now you agree with them instead I My father started refusing duels near the end Elhokar tapped on the railing I see why you feel the need for a Highprince of War and you may have a point But the others very much like the present arrangement Because it is comfortable to them If we are going to win we will need to upset them Dalinar stepped forward Elhokar maybe its been long enough Six years ago naming a Highprince of War might well have been a mistake But now We know one another better and weve been working united against the Parshendi Perhaps it is time to take the next step Perhaps the king said You think they are ready Ill let you prove it to me If you can show me that they are willing to work with you Uncle then Ill consider naming you Highprince of War Is that satisfactory It was a solid compromise Very well Good the king said standing up Then let us part for now It is growing late and I have yet to hear what Ruthar wishes of me Dalinar nodded his farewell walking back through the kings chambers Renarin trailing him The more he considered the more he felt that this was the right thing to do Retreating would not work with the Alethi particularly not with their current mindset But if he could shock them out of their complacency force them to adopt a more aggressive strategy He was still lost in thought considering that as they left the kings palace and made their way down the ramps to where their horses waited He climbed astride Gallant nodding his thanks to the groom who had cared for the Ryshadium The horse had recovered from his fall during the hunt his leg solid and hale It was a short distance back to Dalinars warcamp and they rode in silence Which of the highprinces should I approach first Dalinar thought Sadeas No No he and Sadeas were already seen working together too often If the other highprinces began to smell a stronger alliance it would drive them to turn against him Best that he approach less powerful highprinces first and see if he could get them to work with him in some way A joint plateau assault perhaps Hed have to approach Sadeas eventually He didnt relish the thought Things were always so much easier when the two of them could work at a safe distance from one another He Father Renarin said He sounded dismayed Dalinar sat upright looking around hand going for his side sword even while he prepared to summon his Shardblade Renarin pointed Eastward Stormward The horizon was growing dark Was there supposed to be a highstorm today Dalinar asked alarmed Elthebar said it was unlikely Renarin said But hes been wrong before Everyone could be wrong about highstorms They could be predicted but it was never an exact science Dalinar narrowed his eyes heart thumping Yes he could sense the signs now The dust picking up the scents changing It was evening but there should still be more light left Instead it was rapidly growing darker and darker The very air felt more frantic Should we go to Aladars camp Renarin said pointing They were nearest Highprince Aladars warcamp and perhaps only a quarterhour ride from the rim of Dalinars own Aladars men would take him in Nobody would forbid shelter to a highprince during a storm But Dalinar shuddered thinking of spending a highstorm trapped in an unfamiliar place surrounded by another highprinces attendants They would see him during an episode Once that happened the rumors would spread like arrows above a battlefield We ride he called kicking Gallant into motion Renarin and the guardsmen fell in behind him hooves a thunder to precurse the coming highstorm Dalinar leaned low tense The grey sky grew clotted with dust and leaves blown ahead of the stormwall and the air grew dense with humid anticipation The horizon burgeoned with thickening clouds Dalinar and the others galloped past Aladars perimeter guards who bustled with activity holding their coats or cloaks against the wind Father Renarin called from behind Are you We have time Dalinar shouted They eventually reached the jagged wall of the Kholin warcamp Here the remaining soldiers wore blue and white and saluted Most had already retreated to their enclosures He had to slow Gallant to get through the checkpoint However it would just be another short gallop to his quarters He turned Gallant preparing to go Father Renarin said pointing eastward The stormwall hung like a curtain in the air speeding toward the camp The massive sheet of rain was a silvery grey the clouds above onyx black lit from within by occasional flashes of lightning The guards who had saluted him were hurrying to a nearby bunker We can make it Dalinar said We Father Renarin said riding up beside him and catching his arm Im sorry The wind whipped at them and Dalinar gritted his teeth looking at his son Renarins spectacled eyes were wide with concern Dalinar glanced at the stormwall again It was only moments away Hes right He handed Gallants reins to an anxious soldier who took the reins of Renarins mount as well and the two of them dismounted The groom rushed away towing the horses into a stone stable Dalinar almost followedthere would be fewer people to watch him in a stablebut a nearby barrack had the door open and those inside waved anxiously That would be safer Resigned Dalinar joined Renarin dashing to the stonewalled barrack The soldiers made room for them there was a group of servants packed inside as well In Dalinars camp no one was forced to weather the tempests in stormtents or flimsy wooden shacks and nobody had to pay for protection inside stone structures The occupants seemed shocked to see their highprince and his son step in several paled as the door thumped shut Their only light was from a few garnets mounted on the walls Someone coughed and outside a scattering of windblown rock chips sprayed against the building Dalinar tried to ignore the uncomfortable eyes around him Wind howled outside Perhaps nothing would happen Perhaps this time The storm hit It began He holds the most frightening and terrible of all of the Shards Ponder on that for a time you old reptile and tell me if your insistence on nonintervention holds firm Because I assure you Rayse will not be similarly inhibited Dalinar blinked The stuffy dimly lit barrack was gone Instead he stood in darkness The air was thick with the scent of dried grain and when he reached out with his left hand he felt a wooden wall He was in a barn of some sort The cool night was still and crisp there was no sign of a storm He felt carefully at his side His side sword was gone as was his uniform Instead he wore a homespun belted tunic and a pair of sandals It was the type of clothing hed seen depicted on ancient statues Stormwinds where have you sent me this time Each of the visions was different This would be the twelfth one hed seen Only twelve he thought It seemed like so many more but this had only begun happening to him a few months ago Something moved in the darkness He flinched in surprise as something living pressed against him He nearly struck it but froze when he heard it whimper He carefully lowered his arm feeling the figures back Slight and smalla child She was quivering Father Her voice trembled Father what is happening As usual he was being seen as someone of this place and time The girl clutched him obviously terrified It was too dark to see the fearspren he suspected were climbing up through the ground Dalinar rested his hand on her back Hush It will be all right It seemed the right thing to say Mother She will be fine The girl huddled more closely against him in the black room He remained still Something felt wrong The building creaked in the wind It wasnt well built the plank beneath Dalinars hand was loose and he was tempted to push it free so he could peek out But the stillness the terrified childThere was an oddly putrid scent in the air Something scratched ever so softly at the barns far wall Like a fingernail being drawn across a wooden tabletop The girl whimpered and the scraping sound stopped Dalinar held his breath heart beating furiously Instinctively he held his hand out to summon his Shardblade but nothing happened It would never come during the visions The far wall of the building exploded inward Splintered wood flew through the darkness as a large shape burst in Lit only by moonglow and starlight from outside the black thing was bigger than an axehound He couldnt make out details but it seemed to have an unnatural wrongness to its form The girl screamed and Dalinar cursed grabbing her with one arm and rolling to the side as the black thing leaped for them It nearly got the child but Dalinar whipped her out of the creatures path Breathless with terror her scream cut off Dalinar spun pushing the girl behind him His side hit a stack of sacks filled with grain as he edged away The barn fell silent Salass violet light shone in the sky outside but the small moon wasnt bright enough to illuminate the barns interior and the creature had moved into a shadowed recess He couldnt see much of it It seemed part of the shadows Dalinar tensed fists forward It made a soft wheezing noise eerie and faintly reminiscent of rhythmic whispering Breathing Dalinar thought No Its sniffing for us The thing darted forward Dalinar whipped a hand to the side and grabbed one of the grain sacks pulling it in front of himself The beast struck the sack its teeth ripping into it and Dalinar pulled tearing the coarse fabric and flinging a fragrant cloud of dusty lavis grain into the air Then he stepped to the side and kicked the beast as hard as he could The creature felt too soft under his foot as if hed kicked a waterskin The blow knocked it to the ground and it made a hissing sound Dalinar flung the bag and its remaining contents upward filling the air with more dried lavis and dust The beast scrambled to its feet and twisted around smooth skin reflecting moonlight It seemed disoriented Whatever it was it hunted by smell and the dust in the air confused it Dalinar grabbed the girl and threw her over his shoulder then dashed past the confused creature barreling through the hole in the broken wall He burst out into violet moonlight He was in a small laita wide rift in the stone with good enough drainage to avoid flooding and a high stone outcropping to break the highstorms In this case the eastern rock formation was shaped like an enormous wave creating shelter for a small village That explained the flimsiness of the barn Lights flickered here and there across the hollow indicating a settlement of several dozen homes He was on the outskirts There was a hogpen to Dalinars right distant homes to his left and just aheadnestled against the rock hillwas a midsized farm house It was built in an archaic style with crem bricks for walls His decision was easy The thing had moved quickly like a predator Dalinar wouldnt outrun it so he charged toward the farm house The sound of the beast breaking out through the barn wall came from behind Dalinar reached the home but the front door was barred Dalinar cursed loudly pounding on it Claws scraped on stone from behind as the thing bounded toward them Dalinar threw his shoulder against the door just as it opened He stumbled inside dropping the girl to the floor as he found his balance A middleaged woman stood inside violet moonlight revealed that she had thick curly hair and a wideeyed terrified expression She slammed the door closed behind him then barred it Praise the Heralds she exclaimed scooping up the girl You found her Heb Bless you Dalinar sidled up to the glassless window looking out The shutter appeared to be broken loose making the window impossible to latch closed He couldnt see the creature He glanced back over his shoulder The buildings floor was simple stone and there was no second story A fireless brick hearth was set on one side with a roughcast iron pot hanging above it It all looked so primitive What year was this Its just a vision he thought A waking dream Why did it feel so real then He looked back out the window It was silent outside A twin row of rockbuds grew on the right side of the yard probably curnips or some other kind of vegetable Moonlight reflected off the smooth ground Where was the creature Had it Something slickskinned and black leapt up from below and crashed against the window It shattered the frame and Dalinar cursed falling as the thing landed on him Something sharp slashed his face cutting open his cheek spilling blood across his skin The girl screamed again Light Dalinar bellowed Get me light He slammed his fist into the side of the creatures toosoft head using his other arm to push back a clawed paw His cheek burned with pain and something raked his side slashing his tunic and cutting his skin With a heave he threw the creature off him It crashed against the wall and he rolled to his feet gasping As the beast righted itself in the dark room Dalinar scrambled away old instincts kicking in pain evaporating as the battle Thrill surged through him He needed a weapon A stool or a table leg The room was so Light flickered on as the woman uncovered a lit pottery lamp The primitive thing used oil not Stormlight but was more than enough to illuminate her terrified face and the girl clinging to her robelike dress The room had a low table and a pair of stools but his eyes were drawn to the small hearth There gleaming like one of the Honorblades of ancient lore was a simple iron fire poker It leaned against the stone hearth tip white with ash Dalinar lunged forward snatching it in one hand twirling it to feel out its balance He had been trained in classical Windstance but he fell into Smokestance instead as it was better with an imperfect weapon One foot forward one foot behind swordor in this case pokerheld forward with the tip toward his opponents heart Only years of training allowed him to maintain his stance as he saw what he was facing The creatures smooth darkasmidnight skin reflected light like a pool of tar It had no visible eyes and its black knifelike teeth bristled in a head set on a sinuous boneless neck The six legs were slender and bent at the sides appearing far too thin to bear the weight of the fluid inklike body This isnt a vision Dalinar thought Its a nightmare The creature raised its head clicking teeth together and made a hissing sound Tasting the air Sweet wisdom of Battar the woman breathed holding her child close Her hands shook as she held up the lamp as if to use it as a weapon A scraping came from outside and was followed by another set of spindly legs slinking over the lip of the broken window This new beast climbed into the room joining its companion which crouched anxiously sniffing at Dalinar It seemed wary as if it could sense that it faced an armedor at least determinedopponent Dalinar cursed himself for a fool raising one hand to his side to stanch the blood He knew logically that he was really back in the barrack with Renarin This was all happening in his mind there was no need for him to fight But every instinct every shred of honor he had drove him to step to the side placing himself between the woman and the beasts Vision memory or delusion he could not stand aside Heb the woman said her voice nervous Who did she see him as Her husband A farmhand Dont be a fool You dont know how The beasts attacked Dalinar leapt forwardremaining in motion was the essence of Smokestanceand spun between the creatures striking to the side with his poker He hit the one on the left ripping a gash in its toosmooth skin The wound bled smoke Moving behind the creatures Dalinar swung again sweeping low at the feet of the unwounded beast knocking it off balance With the followthrough he slammed the side of the poker into the face of the wounded beast as it turned and snapped at him The old Thrill the sense of battle consumed him It did not enrage him as it did some men but everything seemed to become clearer crisper His muscles moved easily he breathed more deeply He came alive He leaped backward as the creatures pressed at him With a kick he knocked over the table tumbling it at one of the beasts He drove the poker at the open maw of the other As he had hoped the inside of its mouth was sensitive The creature let out a pained hiss and scrambled back Dalinar moved to the overturned table and kicked off one of the legs He scooped it up falling into Smokestances swordandknife form He used the wooden leg to fend off one creature while he thrust three times at the face of the other ripping a gash in its cheek that bled smoke it came out as a hiss There were distant screams outside Blood of my fathers he thought These arent the only two He needed to be done and quickly If the fight dragged on theyd wear him down faster than he wore them down Who even knew if beasts like this got tired Bellowing he jumped forward Sweat streamed from his forehead and the room seemed to grow just faintly darker Or no more focused Just him and the beasts The only wind was that of his weapons spinning the only sound that of his feet hitting the floor the only vibration that of his heart thumping His sudden whirlwind of blows shocked the creatures He smashed the table leg against one forcing it back then threw himself at the other one earning a rake of the claws against his arm as he rammed the poker into the beasts chest The skin resisted at first but then broke his poker moving through easily after that A powerful jet of smoke burst out around Dalinars hand He pulled his arm free and the creature stumbled back legs growing thinner body deflating like a leaking wineskin He knew hed exposed himself in attacking There was nothing to do but throw his arm up as the other beast leapt on him slashing his forehead and his arm biting his shoulder Dalinar screamed slamming the table leg again and again at the beasts head He tried forcing the creature back but it was terribly strong So Dalinar let himself slip to the ground and kicked upward tossing the beast over his head The fangs ripped free of Dalinars shoulder with a spray of blood The beast hit the floor in a mess of black legs Dizzy Dalinar forced himself to his feet and fell into his stance Always keep the stance The creature got to its feet at about the same time and Dalinar ignored the pain ignored the blood letting the Thrill give him focus He leveled the poker The table leg had fallen from his bloodslick fingers The beast crouched then charged Dalinar let the fluid nature of Smokestance direct him stepping to the side and smashing the poker into the beasts legs It tripped as Dalinar turned around wielding his poker with both hands and slamming it directly down into the creatures back The powerful blow broke the skin passed through the creatures body and hit the stone floor The creature struggled legs working in effectively as smoke hissed out the holes in its back and stomach Dalinar stepped away wiping blood from his forehead leaving the weapon to fall to the side and clang to the ground still impaling the beast Three Gods Heb the woman whispered He turned to find her looking completely shocked as she stared at the deflating carcasses I should have helped she mumbled should have grabbed something to hit them But you were so fast Itit was just a few heartbeats WhereHow She focused on him Ive never seen anything like it Heb You fought like alike one of the Radiants themselves Where did you learn that Dalinar didnt answer He pulled off his shirt grimacing as the pain of his wounds returned Only the shoulder was immediately dangerous but it was bad his left arm was growing numb He ripped the shirt in half tying one portion around his gashed right forearm then wadded the rest and pressed it against his shoulder He walked over and pulled the poker free of the deflated body which now resembled a black silk sack Then he moved to the window The other homes showed signs of being attacked fires burning faint screams hanging on the wind We need to get someplace safe he said Is there a cellar nearby A what Cave in the rock manmade or natural No caves the woman said joining him at the window How would men make a hole in the rock With a Shardblade or a Soulcaster Or even with basic miningthough that could be difficult as the crem would seal up caverns and highstorm rains made for an extremely potent risk of flooding Dalinar looked out the window again Dark shapes moved in the moonlight some were coming in their direction He wavered dizzy Blood loss Gritting his teeth he steadied himself against the frame of the window How long was this vision going to last We need a river Something to wash away the trail of our scent Is there one nearby The woman nodded growing pale faced as she noticed the dark forms in the night Get the girl woman The girl Seeli our daughter And since when have you called me woman Is Taffa so hard to say Stormwinds Heb what has gotten into you He shook his head moving to the door and throwing it open still carrying the poker Bring the lamp The light wont give us away I dont think they can see The woman obeyed hurrying to collect Seelishe looked to be about six or seventhen followed Dalinar out the clay lamps fragile flame quivering in the night It looked a little like a slipper The river Dalinar asked You know where I hit my head Taffa Dalinar said Im dizzy Its hard to think The woman looked worried at that but seemed to accept this answer She pointed away from the village Lets go he said moving out into the darkness Are attacks by these beasts common During Desolations perhaps but not in my life Stormwinds Heb We need to get you to No he said We keep moving They continued along a path which ran up toward the back side of the wave formation Dalinar kept glancing back at the village How many people were dying below murdered by those beasts from Damnation Where were the landlords soldiers Perhaps this village was too remote too far from a citylords direct protection Or perhaps things didnt work that way in this era this place Ill see the woman and child to the river then Ill return to organize a resistance If anyone is left The thought seemed laughable He had to use the poker to keep himself upright How was he going to organize a resistance He slipped on a steep portion of the trail and Taffa set down the lamp grabbing his arm concerned The landscape was rough with boulders and rockbuds their vines and leaves extended in the cool wet night Those rustled in the wind Dalinar righted himself then nodded to the woman gesturing for her to continue A faint scraping sounded in the night Dalinar turned tense Heb the woman asked sounding afraid Hold up the light She raised the lamp illuminating the hillside in flickering yellow A good dozen midnight patches skins too smooth were creeping over rockbuds and boulders Even their teeth and claws were black Seeli whimpered pulling close to her mother Run Dalinar said softly raising his poker Heb theyre Run he bellowed Theyre in front of us too He spun picking out the dark patches ahead He cursed looking around There he said pointing to a nearby rock formation It was tall and flat He shoved Taffa forward and she towed Seeli their singlepiece blue dresses rippling in the wind They ran more quickly than he could in his state and Taffa reached the rock wall first She looked up as if to climb to the top It was too steep for that Dalinar just wanted something solid to put at his back He stepped onto a flat open section of rock before the formation and raised his weapon Black beasts crawled carefully over the stones Could he distract them somehow and let the other two flee He felt so dizzy What Id give for my Shardplate Seeli whimpered Her mother tried to comfort her but the womans voice was unnerved She knew Knew those bundles of blackness like living night would rip them and tear them What was that word shed used Desolation The book spoke of them The Desolations had happened during the nearmythical shadowdays before real history began Before mankind had defeated the Voidbringers and taken the war to heaven The Voidbringers Was that what these things were Myths Myths come to life to kill him Several of the creatures lunged forward and he felt the Thrill surge within him again strengthening him as he swung They jumped back cautious testing for weakness Others sniffed the air pacing They wanted to get at the woman and child Dalinar jumped at them forcing them away uncertain where he found the strength One got close and he swung at it falling into Windstance as it was most familiar The sweeping strikes the grace He struck at the beast scoring it on its flank but two others jumped at him from the side Claws raked his back and the weight threw him to the stones He cursed rolling punching a creature and tossing it back Another bit his wrist causing him to drop the poker in a flash of pain He bellowed and slammed his fist into the creatures jaw and it opened reflexively freeing his hand The monsters pressed forward Somehow he got to his feet and stumbled back against the rock wall The woman threw the lamp at a creature that got too close spraying oil across the stones and setting it alight The fire didnt seem to bother the creatures The move exposed Seeli as Taffa fell off balance in the throw A monster knocked her down and others scrambled for the childbut Dalinar leaped for her wrapping his arms around her huddling down and turning his back on the monsters One leaped on his back Claws sliced his skin Seeli whimpered in terror Taffa was screaming as the monsters overwhelmed her Why are you showing me this Dalinar bellowed into the night Why must I live this vision Curse you Claws raked his back he clutched Seeli back arching in pain He cast his eyes upward toward the sky And there he saw a brilliant blue light falling through the air It was like a star rock dropping at an incredible speed Dalinar cried out as the light hit the ground a short distance away cracking the stone spraying rock chips in the air The ground shook The beasts froze Dalinar turned numbly to the side then he watched in amazement as the light stood up limbs unfolding It wasnt a star at all It was a mana man in glowing blue Shardplate bearing a Shardblade trails of Stormlight rising from his body The creatures hissed furiously suddenly throwing themselves at the figure ignoring Dalinar and the other two The Shardbearer raised his Blade and struck forward with skill stepping into the attacks Dalinar lay stunned This was unlike any Shardbearer he had ever seen The Plate glowed with an even blue light and glyphssome familiar others notwere etched into the metal They trailed blue vapor Moving fluidly Plate clinking the man struck at the beasts He effortlessly sheared a monster in half flinging pieces into the night that trailed black smoke Dalinar pulled himself to Taffa She was alive though her side was torn and flayed Seeli tugged at her weeping Need todo something Dalinar thought dully Be at peace a voice said Dalinar lurched turning to see a woman in delicate Shardplate kneeling beside him holding something bright It was a topaz entwined with a heliodor both set into a fine metal framework each stone as big as a mans hand The woman had light tan eyes that almost seemed to glow in the night and she wore no helm Her hair was pulled back into a bun She raised a hand and touched his forehead Ice washed across him Suddenly his pain was gone The woman reached out and touched Taffa The flesh on her arm regrew in an eyeblink the torn muscle remained where it was but other flesh just grew where the chunks had been torn out The skin knitted up over it without flaw and the female Shardbearer wiped away the blood and torn flesh with a white cloth Taffa looked up awed You came she whispered Bless the Almighty The female Shardbearer stood her armor glowed with an even amber light She smiled and turned to the side a Shardblade forming from mist into her hand as she rushed to aid her companion A woman Shardbearer Dalinar thought Hed never seen such a thing He stood up hesitant He felt strong and healthy as if hed just awakened from a good nights sleep He glanced down at his arm pulling off his makeshift bandage He had to wipe free blood and some torn skin but underneath the skin was perfectly healed He took a few deep breaths Then shrugged picked up his poker and joined the fight Heb Taffa called from behind Are you insane He didnt respond He couldnt very well just sit there while two strangers fought to protect him There were dozens of the black creatures As he watched one landed a scraping hit on the Shardbearer in blue and the claw scored the Shardplate digging into and cracking it The danger to these Shardbearers was real The female Shardbearer turned to Dalinar She had her helm on now When had she put it on She seemed shocked as Dalinar threw himself at one of the black beasts slashing it with his poker He fell into Smokestance and fended against its counterattack The female Shardbearer turned to her companion then the two of them fell into stances forming a triangle with Dalinar his position closest to the rock formation With two Shardbearers alongside him the fighting went remarkably better than it had back at the house He only managed to dispatch a single beastthey were quick and strong and he fought defensively trying to distract and keep pressure off the Shardbearers The creatures did not retreat They continued to attack until the last one was sliced in two by the female Shardbearer Dalinar stopped puffing lowering his poker Other lights had fallenand still were fallingfrom the sky in the direction of the village presumably some of these strange Shardbearers had landed there as well Well a strong voice said I must say that Ive never before had the pleasure of fighting alongside a comrade with suchunconventional means Dalinar turned to find the male Shardbearer regarding him Where had the mans helm gone The Shardbearer stood with his Blade resting on his armored shoulder and he inspected Dalinar with eyes of such bright blue they were almost white Were those eyes actually glowing leaking Stormlight His skin was dark brown like a Makabaki and he had short black curly hair His armor no longer glowed though one large symbolemblazoned across the front of the breastplatestill gave off a faint blue light Dalinar recognized the symbol the particular pattern of the stylized double eye eight spheres connected with two at the center It had been the symbol of the Lost Radiants back when theyd been called the Knights Radiant The female Shardbearer watched the village Who trained you in the sword the male knight asked Dalinar Dalinar met the eyes of the knight He had no idea how to respond This is my husband Heb good knight Taffa said rushing forward leading her daughter by the hand Hes never seen a sword far as I know Your stances are unfamiliar to me the knight said But they were practiced and precise This level of skill comes only with years of training I have rarely seen a manknight or soldierfight as well as you did Dalinar remained silent No words for me I see the knight said Very well But should you wish to put that mysterious training of yours to use come to Urithiru Urithiru Dalinar said Hed heard that name somewhere Yes the knight said I can not promise you a position in one of the ordersthat decision is not minebut if your skill with the sword is similar to your skill with hearthtending implements then I am confident you will find a place with us He turned eastward toward the village Spread the word Signs like this one are not without import A Desolation is coming He turned to his companion I will go Guard these three and lead them to the village We can not leave them alone in the dangers of this night His companion nodded The blue knights armor began to glow faintly then he launched into the air as if falling straight up Dalinar stumbled back shocked watching the glowing blue figure rise then arc downward toward the village Come the woman said voice ringing inside her helm She began to hurry down the incline Wait Dalinar said hastening after her Taffa scooping up her daughter and following Behind them the oil was burning out The female knight slowed to allow Dalinar and Taffa to keep pace with her I must know Dalinar said feeling foolish What year is it The knight turned to him Her helm was gone He blinked when had that happened Unlike her companion she had light skinnot pale like someone from Shinovar but a natural light tan like an Alethi It is Eighth Epoch three thirtyseven Eighth Epoch Dalinar thought What does that mean This vision had been different from the others They had been more brief for one thing And the voice that spoke to him Where was it Where am I Dalinar asked the knight What kingdom The knight frowned Are you not healed I am well I justI need to know Which kingdom am I in This is Natanatan Dalinar released an inhaled breath Natanatan The Shattered Plains lay in the land that had once been Natanatan The kingdom had fallen centuries ago And you fight for Natanatans king he asked She laughed The Knights Radiant fight for no king and for all of them Then where do you live Urithiru is where our orders are centered but we live in cities all across Alethela Dalinar froze in place Alethela It was the historical name for the place that had become Alethkar You cross kingdom borders to fight Heb Taffa said She seemed very concerned You were the one who promised me that the Radiants would come protect us just before you went out searching for Seeli Is your mind still muddled Lady knight could you heal him again I should save Regrowth for others who might be wounded the woman said glancing at the village The fighting seemed to be dying down Im fine Dalinar said AlethkAlethela You live there It is our duty and our privilege the woman said to stay vigilant for the Desolation One kingdom to study the arts of war so that the others might have peace We die so that you may live It has ever been our place Dalinar stood still sorting through that All who can fight are needed the woman said And all who have a desire to fight should be compelled to come to Alethela Fighting even this fighting against the Ten Deaths changes a person We can teach you so that it will not destroy you Come to us Dalinar found himself nodding Every pasture needs three things the woman said voice changing as if she were quoting from memory Flocks to grow herdsmen to tend and watchers at the rim We of Alethela are those watchersthe warriors who protect and fight We maintain the terrible arts of killing then pass them on to others when the Desolation comes The Desolation he said That means the Voidbringers right Those are what we fought this night The knight sniffed dismissively Voidbringers These No this was Midnight Essence though who released it is still a mystery She looked to the side expression growing distant Harkaylain says the Desolation is close and he is not often wrong He A sudden screaming sounded in the night The knight cursed looking toward it Wait here Call out if the Essence returns I will hear She dashed off into the darkness Dalinar raised a hand torn between following and staying to watch over Taffa and her daughter Stormfather he thought realizing theyd been left in darkness now that the knights glowing armor was gone He turned back to Taffa She stood on the trail beside him eyes looking oddly distracted Taffa he asked I miss these times Taffa said Dalinar jumped That voice wasnt hers It was a mans voice deep and powerful It was the voice that spoke to him during every vision Who are you Dalinar asked They were one once Taffaor whatever it wassaid The orders Men Not without problems or strife of course But focused Dalinar felt a chill Something about that voice always seemed faintly familiar to him It had even in the first vision Please You have to tell me what this is why you are showing me these things Who are you Some servant of the Almighty I wish I could help you Taffa said looking at Dalinar but ignoring his questions You have to unite them As youve said before But I need help The things the knight said about Alethkar Are they true Can we really be that way again To speak of what might be is forbidden the voice said To speak of what was depends on perspective But I will try to help Then give me more than vague answers Taffa regarded him somber Somehow by starlight alone he could make out her brown eyes There was something deep something daunting hiding behind them At least tell me this Dalinar said grasping for a specific question to ask I have trusted Highprince Sadeas but my sonAdolinthinks I am a fool to do so Should I continue to trust Sadeas Yes the being said This is important Do not let strife consume you Be strong Act with honor and honor will aid you Finally Dalinar thought Something concrete He heard voices The dark landscape around Dalinar grew vague No He reached for the woman Dont send me back yet What should I do about Elhokar and the war I will give you what I can The voice was growing indistinct I am sorry for not giving more What kind of answer is that Dalinar bellowed He shook himself struggling Hands held him Where had they come from He cursed batting them away twisting trying to break free Then he froze He was in the barrack at the Shattered Plains soft rain rattling on the roof The bulk of the storm had passed A group of soldiers held Dalinar down while Renarin watched with concern Dalinar grew still mouth open He had been yelling The soldiers looked uncomfortable glancing at each other not meeting his gaze If it was like before hed have acted out his role in the vision speaking in gibberish flailing around My mind is clear now Dalinar said Its all right You can all let me go Renarin nodded to the others and they hesitantly released him Renarin tried to make some stuttering excuses telling them that his father was simply eager for combat It didnt sound very convincing Dalinar retreated to the back of the barrack sitting down on the floor between two rolled up bedrolls just breathing in and out and thinking He trusted the visions yet his life in the warcamps had been difficult enough lately without people presuming him mad Act with honor and honor will aid you The vision had told him to trust Sadeas But hed never be able to explain that to Adolinwho not only hated Sadeas but thought the visions were delusions from Dalinars mind The only thing to do was keep going as he had And find a way somehow to get the highprinces to work together SEVEN YEARS AGO I can save her Kal said pulling off his shirt The child was only five Shed fallen far I can save her He was mumbling A crowd had gathered It had been two months since Brightlord Wistiows death they still didnt have a replacement citylord He had barely seen Laral at all in that time Kal was only thirteen but hed been trained well The first danger was blood loss the childs leg had broken a compound fracture and it was spurting red where bone had split the skin Kal found his hands trembling as he pressed his fingers against the wound The broken bone was slick even the jagged end wetted by blood Which arteries had been torn What are you doing to my daughter Thickshouldered Harl pushed through the onlookers You cremling you storms leavings Dont touch Miasal Dont Harl broke off as several of the other men pulled him back They knew that Kalwho had been passing by chancewas the girls best hope Alim had already been sent to fetch Kals father I can save her Kal said Her face was pale and she didnt move That head wound maybe it Cant think about that One of the lower leg arteries was severed He used his shirt to tie a tourniquet to stop the blood but it kept slipping Fingers still pressed against the cut he called Fire I need fire Hurry And someone give me your shirt Several men rushed off as Kal elevated the leg One of the men hurriedly handed over his shirt Kal knew where to pinch to cut off the artery the tourniquet slipped but his fingers did not He held that artery closed pressing the shirt on the rest of the wound until Valama came back with a candles flame Theyd already begun heating a knife Good Kal took the knife burning it into the wound releasing the sharply pungent smell of scorched flesh A cool wind blew across them carrying it away Kals hands stopped shaking He knew what to do He moved with skill that surprised even him perfectly cauterizing as his training took control He still needed to tie off the arterya cauterization might not hold on an artery this largebut the two together should work When he was done the bleeding had stopped He sat back smiling And then he noticed that Miasals head wound wasnt bleeding either Her chest wasnt moving No Harl fell to his knees No Do something I Kal said Hed stopped the bleeding Hed Hed lost her He didnt know what to say how to respond A deep terrible sickness washed over him Harl shoved him aside wailing Kal fell backward He found himself shaking again as Harl clutched the corpse Around them the crowd was silent An hour later Kal sat on the steps in front of the surgery room crying It was a soft thing his grief A shake here A few persistent tears slipping down his cheeks He sat with knees up arms wrapped around his legs trying to figure out how to stop hurting Was there a salve to take away this pain A bandage to stop the flow from his eyes He should have been able to save her Footsteps approached and a shadow fell on him Lirin knelt down beside him I inspected your work son You did well Im proud I failed Kal whispered His clothing was stained red Before hed washed the blood free of his hands it had been scarlet But soaked into his clothing it was a duller reddish brown Ive known men who practiced for hours and hours yet still froze when confronted by a wounded person Its harder when it takes you by surprise You didnt freeze you went to her administered help And you did it well I dont want to be a surgeon Kal said Im terrible at it Lirin sighed rounding the steps sitting down beside his son Kal this happens Its unfortunate but you couldnt have done more That little body lost blood too quickly Kal didnt reply You have to learn when to care son Lirin said softly And when to let go Youll see I had similar problems when I was younger Youll grow calluses And this is a good thing Kal thought another tear trickling down his cheek You have to learn when to careand when to let go In the distance Harl continued to wail One need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to Sel to see proof of what I say Kaladin didnt want to open his eyes If he opened his eyes hed be awake And if he were awake that painthe burning in his side the aching of his legs the dull throb in his arms and shoulderswouldnt be just a nightmare It would be real And it would be his He stifled a groan rolling onto his side It all ached Every length of muscle every inch of skin His head pounded It seemed that his very bones were sore He wanted to lie motionless and throbbing until Gaz was forced to come and tow him out by his ankles That would be easy Didnt he deserve to do what was easy for once But he couldnt To stop moving to give up would be the same as dying and he could not let that happen Hed made his decision already He would help the bridgemen Curse you Hav he thought You can boot me out of my bunk even now Kaladin threw off his blanket forcing himself to stand The door to the barrack was cracked open to let in fresh air He felt worse standing up but the life of a bridgeman wouldnt wait for him to recover You either kept up or you got crushed Kaladin steadied himself hand against the unnaturally smooth Soulcast rock of the barrack wall Then he took a deep breath and crossed the room Oddly more than a few of the men were awake and sitting up They watched Kaladin in silence They were waiting Kaladin realized They wanted to see if Id get up He found the three wounded where hed left them at the front of the barrack He held his breath as he checked on Leyten Amazingly he was still alive His breathing was still shallow his pulse weak and his wounds dire but he was alive He wouldnt stay that way long without antiseptic None of the wounds looked infected with rotspren yet but it would only be a matter of time in these dirty confines He needed some of the apothecarys salves But how He checked the other two Hobber was smiling openly He was roundfaced and lean with a gap between his teeth and short black hair Thank you he said Thank you for saving me Kaladin grunted inspecting the mans leg Youll be fine but you wont be able to walk for a few weeks Ill bring food from the mess hall for you Thank you Hobber whispered taking Kaladins hand clutching it He actually seemed to be tearing up That smile forced back the gloom made the aches and soreness fade Kaladins father had described that kind of smile Those smiles werent why Lirin had become a surgeon but they were why hed remained one Rest Kaladin said and keep that wound clean We dont want to attract any rotspren Let me know if you see any They are small and red like tiny insects Hobber nodded eagerly and Kaladin moved to Dabbid The youthful bridgeman looked just as he had the day before staring forward eyes unfocused He was sitting like that when I fell asleep too sir Hobber said Its like he hasnt moved all night Gives me the chills it does Kaladin snapped his fingers in front of Dabbids eyes The man jumped at the sound focusing on the fingers following them as Kaladin moved his hand Hes been hit in the head I think Hobber said No Kaladin said Its battle shock It will wear off I hope If you say so sir Hobber said scratching at the side of his head Kaladin stood and pushed the door open all the way lighting the room It was a clear day the sun just barely over the horizon Already sounds drifted from the warcamp a blacksmith working early hammer on metal Chulls trumpeting in the stables The air was cool chilly clinging to the vestiges of night It smelled clean and fresh Spring weather You got up Kaladin told himself Might as well get on with it He forced himself to go out and do his stretches body complaining at each motion Then he checked his own wound It wasnt too bad though infection could make it worse Stormwinds take that apothecary he thought fetching a ladle full of water from the bridgeman barrel using it to wash his wound He immediately regretted the bitter thought against the elderly apothecary What was the man to do Give Kaladin the antiseptic for free It was Highprince Sadeas he should be cursing Sadeas was responsible for the wound and was also the one who had forbidden the surgeons hall to give supplies to bridgemen slaves and servants of the lesser nahns By the time he finished stretching a handful of bridgemen had risen to get something to drink They stood around the barrel regarding Kaladin There was only one thing to do Setting his jaw Kaladin crossed the lumber grounds and located the plank hed carried the day before The carpenters hadnt yet added it to their bridge so Kaladin picked it up and walked back to the barracks Then he began practicing the same way he had yesterday He couldnt go as fast In fact much of the time he could only walk But as he worked his aches soothed His headache faded His feet and shoulders still hurt and he had a deep latent exhaustion But he didnt embarrass himself by falling over In his practice he passed the other bridgeman barracks The men in front of them were barely distinguishable from those in Bridge Four The same dark sweatstained leather vests over bare chests or loosely tied shirts There was the occasional foreigner Thaylens or Vedens most often But they were unified in their scraggly appearances unshaven faces and haunted eyes Several groups watched Kaladin with outright hostility Were they worried that his practice would encourage their own bridgeleaders to work them He had hoped that some members of Bridge Four might join his workout Theyd obeyed him during the battle after all even going so far as to help him with the wounded His hope was in vain While some bridgemen watched others ignored him None took part Eventually Syl flitted down and landed on the end of his plank riding like a queen on her palanquin Theyre talking about you she said as he passed the Bridge Four barrack again Not surprising Kaladin said between puffs Some think youve gone mad she said Like that man who just sits and stares at the floor They say the battle stress broke your mind Maybe theyre right I didnt consider that What is madness she asked sitting with one leg up against her chest vaporous skirt flickering around her calves and vanishing into mist Its when men dont think right Kaladin said glad for the conversation to distract him Men never seem to think right Madness is worse than normal Kaladin said with a smile It really just depends on the people around you How different are you from them The person that stands out is mad I guess So you all justvote on it she asked screwing up her face Well not so actively But its the right idea She sat thoughtfully for a time longer Kaladin she finally said Why do men lie I can see what lies are but I dont know why people do it Lots of reasons Kaladin said wiping the sweat from his brow with his free hand then using it to steady the plank Is it madness I dont know if Id say that Everyone does it So maybe youre all a little mad He chuckled Yes perhaps But if everyone does it she said leaning her head on her knee then the one who doesnt would be the one who is mad right Isnt that what you said earlier Well I guess But I dont think theres a person out there who hasnt ever lied Dalinar Who The kings uncle Syl said Everyone says he never lies Your bridgemen even talk about it sometimes Thats right The Blackthorn Kaladin had heard of him even in his youth Hes a lighteyes That means he lies But Theyre all the same Syl The more noble they look the more corrupt they are inside Its all an act He fell quiet surprised at the vehemence of his bitterness Storm you Amaram You did this to me Hed been burned too often to trust the flame I dont think men were always this way she said absently getting a faroff look in her face I Kaladin waited for her to continue but she didnt He passed Bridge Four again many of the men relaxed backs to the barrack wall waiting for the afternoon shade to cover them They rarely waited inside Perhaps staying inside all day was too gloomy even for bridgemen Syl he finally prompted Were you going to say something It seems Ive heard men talk about times when there were no lies There are stories Kaladin said about the times of the Heraldic Epochs when men were bound by honor But youll always find people telling stories about supposedly better days You watch A man joins a new team of soldiers and the first thing hell do is talk about how wonderful his old team was We remember the good times and the bad ones forgetting that most times are neither good nor bad They just are He broke into a jog The sun was growing warm overhead but he wanted to move The stories he continued between puffs they prove it What happened to the Heralds They abandoned us What happened to the Knights Radiant They fell and became tarnished What happened to the Epoch Kingdoms They crashed when the church tried to seize power You cant trust anyone with power Syl What do you do then Have no leaders No You give the power to the lighteyes and leave it to corrupt them Then try to stay as far from them as possible His words felt hollow How good a job had he done staying away from lighteyes He always seemed to be in the thick of them caught in the muddy mire they created with their plots schemes and greed Syl fell silent and after that last jog he decided to stop his practicing He couldnt afford to strain himself again He returned the plank The carpenters scratched their heads but didnt complain He made his way back to the bridgemen noticing that a small group of themincluding Rock and Teftwere chatting and glancing at Kaladin You know Kaladin said to Syl talking to you probably doesnt do anything for my reputation of being insane Ill do my best to stop being so interesting Syl said alighting on his shoulder She put her hands on her hips then plopped down to a sitting position smiling obviously pleased with her comment Before Kaladin could get back to the barrack he noticed Gaz hustling across the lumberyard toward him You Gaz said pointing at Kaladin Hold a season Kaladin stopped waiting with folded arms Ive news for you Gaz said squinting with his good eye Brightlord Lamaril heard what you did with the wounded How Storms boy Gaz said You think people wouldnt talk What were you going to do Hide three men in the middle of us all Kaladin took a deep breath but backed down Gaz was right All right What does it matter We didnt slow the army Yeah Gaz said but Lamaril isnt too polished on the idea of paying and feeding bridgemen who cant work He took the matter to Highprince Sadeas intending to have you strung up Kaladin felt a chill Strung up would mean hung out during a highstorm for the Stormfather to judge It was essentially a death sentence And Brightlord Sadeas refused to let him do it Gaz said What Had he misjudged Sadeas But no This was part of the act Brightlord Sadeas Gaz said grimly told Lamaril to let you keep the soldiersbut to forbid them food or pay while theyre unable to work Said it would show why hes forced to leave bridgemen behind That cremling Kaladin muttered Gaz paled Hush Thats the highprince himself youre talking about boy He glanced about to see if anyone had heard Hes trying to make an example of my men He wants the other bridgemen to see the wounded suffer and starve He wants it to seem like hes doing a mercy by leaving the wounded behind Well maybe hes right Its heartless Kaladin said He brings back wounded soldiers He leaves the bridgemen because its cheaper to find new slaves than it is to care for wounded ones Gaz fell silent Thank you for bringing me this news News Gaz snapped I was sent to give you orders lordling Dont try to get extra food from the mess hall for your wounded youll be refused With that he rushed away muttering to himself Kaladin made his way back to the barrack Stormfather Where was he going to get food enough to feed three men He could split his own meals with them but while bridgemen were kept fed they werent given an excess Even feeding one man beyond himself would be a stretch Trying to split the meals four ways would leave the wounded too weak to recover and Kaladin too weak to run bridges And he still needed antiseptic Rotspren and disease killed far more men in war than the enemy did Kaladin stepped up to the men lounging by the barrack Most were going about the usual bridgeman activitiessprawled on the ground and despondently staring into the air sitting and despondently staring at the ground standing and despondently staring into the distance Bridge Four wasnt on bridge duty at all this day and they didnt have work detail until third afternoon bell Gaz says our wounded are to be refused food or pay until they are well Kaladin said to the collected men Some of themSigzil Peet Koolfnodded as if this was what theyd expected Highprince Sadeas wants to make an example of us Kaladin said He wants to prove that bridgemen arent worth healing and hes going to do it by making Hobber Leyten and Dabbid die slow painful deaths He took a deep breath I want to pool our resources to buy medicine and get food for the wounded We can keep those three alive if a few of you will split your meals with them Well need about two dozen or so clearmarks to buy the right medicine and supplies Who has something they can spare The men stared at him then Moash started laughing Others joined him They waved dismissive hands and broke up walking away leaving Kaladin with his hand out Next time it could be you he called What will you do if youre the one that needs healing Ill die Moash said not even bothering to look back Out on the field quickly rather than back here over a weeks time Kaladin lowered his hand He sighed turning and almost ran into Rock The beefy towerlike Horneater stood with arms folded like a tanskinned statue Kaladin looked up at him hopeful Dont have any spheres Rock said with a grunt Is all spent already Kaladin sighed It wouldnt have mattered anyway Two of us couldnt afford to buy the medicine Not alone I will give some food Rock grumbled Kaladin glanced back at him surprised But only for this man with arrow in his leg Rock said arms still folded Hobber Whatever Rock said He looks like he could get better Other one he will die Is certain And I have no pity for man who sits there not doing anything But for the other one you may have my food Some of it Kaladin smiled raising a hand and gripping the larger mans arm Thank you Rock shrugged You took my place Without this thing I would be dead Kaladin smirked at that logic Im not dead Rock Youd be fine Rock shook his head Id be dead Is something strange about you All men can see it even if they dont want to speak of this thing I looked at bridge where you were Arrows hit all around youbeside your head next to your hands But they werent hitting you Luck Is no such thing Rock glanced at Kaladins shoulder Besides there is mafahliki who always follows you The large Horneater bowed his head reverently to Syl then made a strange gesture with his hand touching his shoulders and then his forehead Kaladin started You can see her He glanced at Syl As a windspren she could appear to those she wanted toand that generally only meant Kaladin Syl seemed shocked No she hadnt appeared to Rock specifically I am alaiiiku Rock said shrugging Which means Rock scowled Airsick lowlanders Is there nothing proper you know Anyway you are special man Bridge Four it lost eight runners yesterday counting the three wounded I know Kaladin said I broke my first promise I said I wasnt going to lose a single one Rock snorted We are bridgemen We die Is how this thing works You might as well promise to make the moons catch each other The large man turned pointing toward one of the other barracks Of the bridges that were fired upon most lost many men Five bridges fell They lost over twenty men each and needed soldiers to help get bridges back Bridge Two lost eleven men and it wasnt even a focus of firing He turned back to Kaladin Bridge Four lost eight Eight men during one of the worst runs of the season And perhaps you will save two of those Bridge Four lost fewest men of any bridge that the Parshendi tried to drop Bridge Four never loses fewest men Everyone knows how it is Luck Rock pointed a fat finger at him cutting him off Airsick lowlander It was just luck But well Kaladin would take it for the small blessing it was No use arguing when someone had finally decided to start listening to him But one man wasnt enough Even if both he and Rock went on half rations one of the sick men would starve He needed spheres He needed them desperately But he was a slave it was illegal for him to earn money in most ways If only he had something he could sell But he owned nothing He A thought occurred to him Come on he said striding away from the barrack Rock followed curiously Kaladin searched through the lumberyard until he found Gaz speaking with a bridgeleader in front of Bridge Threes barrack As was growing more common Gaz grew pale when Kaladin approached and made as if to scurry away Gaz wait Kaladin said holding out his hand I have an offer for you The bridge sergeant froze Beside Gaz Bridge Threes leader shot Kaladin a scowl The way the other bridgemen had been treating him suddenly made sense They were perturbed to see Bridge Four come out of a battle in such good shape Bridge Four was supposed to be unlucky Everyone needed someone else to look down onand the other bridge crews could be consoled by the small mercy that they werent in Bridge Four Kaladin had upset that The darkbearded bridgeleader retreated leaving Kaladin and Rock alone with Gaz What are you offering this time Gaz said More dun spheres No Kaladin said thinking quickly This would have to be handled very carefully Im out of spheres But we cant continue like this you avoiding me the other bridge crews hating me Dont see what we can do about it I tell you what Kaladin said as if suddenly having a thought Is anyone on stonegathering detail today Yeah Gaz said gesturing over his shoulder Bridge Three Bussik there was just trying to convince me that his team is too weak to go Storms blast me but I believe him Lost twothirds of his men yesterday and Ill be the one who gets chewed out when they dont gather enough stones to meet quota Kaladin nodded sympathetically Stone gathering was one of the least desirable work details it involved traveling outside of the camp and filling wagons with large rocks Soulcasters fed the army by turning rocks into grain and it was easier for themfor reasons only they knewif they had distinct separate stones So men gathered rocks It was menial sweaty tiring mindless work Perfect for bridgemen Why dont you send a different bridge team Kaladin asked Bah Gaz said You know the kind of trouble that makes If Im seen playing favorites I never hear an end of the complaining Nobody will complain if you make Bridge Four do it Gaz glanced at him single eye narrowed I didnt think youd react well to being treated differently Ill do it Kaladin said grimacing Just this once Look Gaz I dont want to spend the rest of my time here fighting against you Gaz hesitated Your men are going to be angry I wont let them think it was me who did this to them Ill tell them that it was my idea All right then Third bell meet at the western checkpoint Bridge Three can clean pots He walked away quickly as if to escape before Kaladin changed his mind Rock stepped up beside Kaladin watching Gaz The little man is right you know The men will hate you for this thing They were looking forward to easy day Theyll get over it But why change for harder work Is trueyou are crazy arent you Maybe But that craziness will get us outside of the warcamp What good is that It means everything Kaladin said glancing back at the barrack It means life and death But were going to need more help Another bridge crew No I mean that weyou and Iwill need help One more man at least He scanned the lumberyard and noted someone sitting in the shadow of Bridge Fours barrack Teft The grizzled bridgeman hadnt been among the group that had laughed at Kaladin earlier but he had been quick to help yesterday going with Rock to carry Leyten Kaladin took a deep breath and strode out across the grounds Rock trailing behind Syl left his shoulder and zipped into the air dancing on a sudden gust of wind Teft looked up as Kaladin and Rock approached The older man had fetched breakfast and he was eating alone a piece of flatbread peeking out beneath his bowl His beard was stained by the curry and he regarded Kaladin with wary eyes before wiping his mouth on his sleeve I like my food son he said Hardly think they feed me enough for one man Let alone two Kaladin squatted in front of him Rock leaned up against the wall and folded his arms watching quietly I need you Teft Kaladin said I said Not your food You Your loyalty Your allegiance The older man continued to eat He didnt have a slave brand and neither did Rock Kaladin didnt know their stories All he knew was that these two had helped when others hadnt They werent completely beaten down Teft Kaladin began Ive given my loyalty before the man said Too many times now Always works out the same Your trust gets betrayed Kaladin asked softly Teft snorted Storms no I betray it You cant depend on me son I belong here as a bridgeman I depended on you yesterday and you impressed me Fluke Ill judge that Kaladin said Teft were all broken in one way or another Otherwise we wouldnt be bridgemen Ive failed My own brother died because of me So why keep caring Its either that or give up and die And if death is better It came back to this problem This was why the bridgemen didnt care if he helped the wounded or not Death isnt better Kaladin said looking Teft in the eyes Oh its easy to say that now But when you stand on the ledge and look down into that dark endless pit you change your mind Just like Hobber did Just like Ive done He hesitated seeing something in the older mans eyes I think youve seen it too Aye Teft said softly Aye I have So are you with us in this thing Rock said squatting down Us Kaladin thought smiling faintly Teft looked back and forth between the two of them I get to keep my food Yes Kaladin said Teft shrugged All right then I guess Cant be any harder than sitting here and having a staring contest with mortality Kaladin held out a hand Teft hesitated then took it Rock held out a hand Rock Teft looked at him finished shaking Kaladins hand then took Rocks Im Teft Stormfather Kaladin thought Id forgotten that most of them dont even bother to learn each others names What kind of name is Rock Teft asked releasing the hand Is a stupid one Rock said with an even face But at least it has meaning Does your name mean anything I guess not Teft said rubbing his bearded chin Rock this is not my real name the Horneater admitted Is just what lowlanders can pronounce Whats your real name then Teft asked You wont be able to say it Teft raised an eyebrow Numuhukumakiakiaialunamor Rock said Teft hesitated then smiled Well I guess in that case Rock will do just fine Rock laughed settling down Our bridgeleader has a plan Something glorious and daring Has something to do with spending our afternoon moving stones in the heat Kaladin smiled leaning forward We need to gather a certain kind of plant A reed that grows in small patches outside the camp In case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster know that Aona and Skai are both dead and that which they held has been Splintered Presumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge Rayse Two days after the incident with the highstorm Dalinar walked with his sons crossing the rocky ground toward the kings feasting basin Dalinars stormwardens projected another few weeks of spring followed by a return to summer Hopefully it wouldnt turn to winter instead Ive been to three more leatherworkers Adolin said softly They have different opinions It seems that even before the strap was cutif it was cutit was worn so thats interfering with things The best consensus has been that the strap was sliced but not necessarily by a knife It could have just been natural wearandtear Dalinar nodded Thats the only evidence that even hints there might be something odd about the girth breaking So we admit that this was just a result of the kings paranoia Ill talk to Elhokar Dalinar decided Let him know weve run into a wall and see if there are any other avenues hed like us to pursue Thatll do Adolin seemed to grow hesitant about something Father Do you want to talk about what happened during the storm It was nothing that hasnt happened before But Enjoy the evening Adolin Dalinar said firmly Im all right Perhaps its good for the men to see what is happening Hiding it has only inspired rumors some of them even worse than the truth Adolin sighed but nodded The kings feasts were always outdoors at the foot of Elhokars palace hill If the stormwardens warned of a highstormor if more mundane weather turned badthen the feast was canceled Dalinar was glad for the outdoor location Even with ornamentation Soulcast buildings felt like caverns The feast basin had been flooded turning it into a shallow artificial lake Circular dining platforms rose like small stone islands in the water The elaborate miniature landscape had been fabricated by the kings Soulcasters who had diverted the water from a nearby stream It reminds me of Sela Tales Dalinar thought as he crossed the first bridge Hed visited that western region of Roshar during his youth And the Purelake There were five islands and the railings of the bridges connecting them were done in scrollwork so fine that after each feast the railings had to be stowed away lest a highstorm ruin them Tonight flowers floated in the slow current Periodically a miniature boatonly a handspan widesailed past bearing an infused gemstone Dalinar Renarin and Adolin stepped onto the first dining platform One cup of blue Dalinar said to his sons After that keep to the orange Adolin sighed audibly Couldnt we just this once So long as you are of my house you follow the Codes My will is firm Adolin Fine Adolin said Come on Renarin The two broke off from Dalinar to remain on the first platform where the younger lighteyes congregated Dalinar crossed to the next island This middle one was for the lesser lighteyes To its left and right lay the segregated dining islandsmens island on the right womens island on the left On the three central ones however the genders mingled Around him the favored invitees took advantage of their kings hospitality Soulcast food was inherently bland but the kings lavish feasts always served imported spices and exotic meats Dalinar could smell roasting pork on the air and even chickens It had been a long time since hed been served meat from one of the strange Shin flying creatures A darkeyed servant passed wearing a gauzy red robe and carrying a tray of orange crab legs Dalinar continued across the island weaving around groups of revelers Most drank violet wine the most intoxicating and flavorful of the colors Almost no one was in battle attire A few men wore tight waistlength jackets but many had dropped all pretense choosing instead loose silk shirts with ruffled cuffs worn with matching slippers The rich material glistened in the lamplight These creatures of fashion shot glances at Dalinar appraising him weighing him He could remember a time when he would have been swarmed by friends acquaintancesand yes even sycophantsat a feast like this Now none approached him though they gave way before him Elhokar might think his uncle was growing weak but his reputation quelled most lesser lighteyes He soon approached the bridge to the final islandthe kings island Polemounted gem lamps ringed it glowing with blue Stormlight and a firepit dominated the center of the platform Deep red coals simmered in its bowels radiating warmth Elhokar sat at his table just behind the firepit and several highprinces ate with him Tables along the sides of the platform were occupied by male or female dinersnever both at the same Wit sat on a raised stool at the end of the bridge leading onto the island Wit actually dressed as a lighteyes shouldhe wore a stiff black uniform silver sword at his waist Dalinar shook his head at the irony Wit was insulting each person as they stepped onto the island Brightness Marakal What a disaster that hairstyle is how brave of you to show it to the world Brightlord Marakal I wish youd warned us you were going to attend Id have forgone supper I do so hate being sick after a full meal Brightlord Cadilar How good it is to see you Your face reminds me of someone dear to me Really wizened Cadilar said hesitating Yes Wit said waving him on my horse Ah Brightlord Neteb you smell unique todaydid you attack a wet whitespine or did one just sneeze on you Lady Alami No please dont speakits much easier to maintain my illusions regarding your intelligence that way And Brightlord Dalinar Wit nodded to Dalinar as he passed Ah my dear Brightlord Taselin Still engaged in your experiment to prove a maximum threshold of human idiocy Good for you Very empirical of you Dalinar hesitated beside Wits chair as Taselin waddled by with a huff Wit Dalinar said do you have to Two what Dalinar Wit said eyes twinkling Eyes hands or spheres Id lend you one of the first butby definitiona man can only have one I and if it is given away who would be Wit then Id lend you one of the second but I fear my simple hands have been digging in the muck far too often to suit one such as you And if I gave you one of my spheres what would I spend the remaining one on Im quite attached to both of my spheres you see He hesitated Or well you cant see Would you like to He stood up off his chair and reached for his belt Wit Dalinar said dryly Wit laughed clapping Dalinar on the arm Im sorry This lot brings out the basest humor in me Perhaps its that muck I spoke of earlier I do try so hard to be elevated in my loathing of them but they make it difficult Care for yourself Wit Dalinar said This lot wont suffer you forever I wouldnt see you dead by their knives I see a fine man within you Yes Wit said scanning the platform He tasted quite delicious Dalinar I fear Im not the one who needs that warning Speak your fears at a mirror a few times when you get home tonight There are rumors about Rumors Yes Terrible things Grow on men like warts Tumors Both Look there is talk about you There is always talk about me This is worse than most Wit said meeting his eyes Did you really speak of abandoning the Vengeance Pact Dalinar took a deep breath That was between me and the king Well he must have spoken of it to others This lot are cowardsand no doubt that makes them feel like experts on the subject for theyve certainly been calling you that a great deal lately Stormfather No Im Wit But I understand how easy a mistake that is to make Because you blow so much air Dalinar growled or because you make so much noise A wide smile split Wits face Why Dalinar Im impressed Maybe I should make you Wit Then I could be a highprince instead He stopped No that would be bad Id go mad after a mere second of listening to them then would likely slaughter the lot Perhaps appoint cremlings in their places The kingdom would undoubtedly fare better Dalinar turned to go Thank you for the warning Wit sat back down on his stool as Dalinar walked away Youre welcome Ah Brightlord Habatab How thoughtful of you to wear a red shirt with a sunburn like that If you continue to make my job this easy I fear my mind shall become as dull as Brightlord Tumuls Oh Brightlord Tumul How unexpected it is to see you standing there I didnt mean to insult your stupidity Really its quite spectacular and worthy of much praise Lord Yonatan and Lady Meirav Ill forgo an insult for you this once on account of your recent wedding though I do find your hat quite impressive Yonatan I trust it is convenient to wear on your head something that doubles as a tent at night Ah and is that Lady Navani behind you How long have you been back at the Plains and how did I not notice the smell Dalinar froze What Obviously your own stench overpowered mine Wit a warm feminine voice said Has no one done my son a service and assassinated you yet No no assassins yet Wit said amused I guess Ive already got too much ass sass of my own Dalinar turned with shock Navani the kings mother was a stately woman with intricately woven black hair And she was not supposed to be here Oh really Wit she said I thought that kind of humor was beneath you So are you technically Wit said smiling from atop his highlegged stool She rolled her eyes Unfortunately Brightness Wit replied with a sigh Ive taken to framing my insults in terms this lot will understand If it will please you I shall attempt to improve my diction to more elevated terms He paused I say do you know any words that rhyme with bescumber Navani just turned her head and looked at Dalinar with a pair of light violet eyes She wore an elegant dress its shimmering red surface unbroken by embroidery The gems in her hairwhich was streaked with a few lines of greywere red as well The kings mother was known as one of the most beautiful women in Alethkar though Dalinar had always found that description inadequate for surely there wasnt a woman on all of Roshar to match her beauty Fool he thought tearing his eyes away from her Your brothers widow With Gavilar dead Navani was now to be treated as Dalinars sister Besides what of his own wife Dead these ten years wiped by his foolishness from his mind Even if he couldnt remember her he should honor her Why had Navani returned As women called out greetings to her Dalinar hurriedly made his way over to the kings table He sat down a servant arrived in moments with a plate for himthey knew his preferences It was steaming peppered chicken cut in medallions and laid atop fried round slices of tenem a soft light orange vegetable Dalinar grabbed a piece of flatbread and slipped his dining knife from the sheath on his right calf So long as he was eating it would be a breach of etiquette for Navani to approach him The food was good It always was at these feasts of Elhokarsin that the son was like the father Elhokar nodded to Dalinar from the end of the table then continued his conversation with Sadeas Highprince Roion sat a few seats down from him Dalinar had an appointment with him in a few days the first of the highprinces hed approach and try to convince to work with him on a joint plateau assault No other highprinces came to sit near Dalinar Only theyand people with specific invitationscould sit at the kings table One man lucky enough to receive such an invitation sat on Elhokars left obviously uncertain if he should join in the conversation or not Water gurgled in the stream behind Dalinar Before him the festivities continued It was a time for relaxation but the Alethi were a reserved people at least when compared with more passionate folk like the Horneaters or the Reshi Still his people seemed to have grown more opulent and selfindulgent since his childhood Wine flowed freely and foods sizzled fragrantly On the first island several young men had stepped into a sparring ring for a friendly duel Young men at a feast often found reason to remove their coats and show off their swordsmanship The women were more modest with their displays but they engaged in them as well On Dalinars own island several women had set up easels where they were sketching painting or doing calligraphy As always they kept their left hands shrouded in their sleeves delicately creating art with the right They sat on high stools the kind that Wit had been usingin fact Wit had probably stolen one for his little performance A few of them attracted creationspren the tiny shapes rolling across the tops of their easels or tables Navani had gathered a group of important lighteyed women to a table A servant passed by in front of Dalinar bringing the women some food It appeared to also have been made with the exotic chicken but had been mixed with steamed methi fruit and covered in a reddishbrown sauce As a boy Dalinar had secretly tried womens food out of curiosity Hed found it distastefully sweet Navani placed something on her table a device of polished brass about the size of a fist with a large infused ruby at its center The red Stormlight lit the entire table throwing shadows down the white tablecloth Navani picked up the device rotating it to show her dinner companions its leglike protrusions Turned that way it looked vaguely crustacean Ive never seen a fabrial like that before Dalinar looked up at her face admiring the contours of her cheek Navani was a renowned artifabrian Perhaps this device was Navani glanced at him and Dalinar froze She flashed the briefest of smiles at him covert and knowing then turned away before he could react Storming woman he thought pointedly turning his attention to his meal He was hungry and got so involved in his food that he almost didnt notice Adolin approaching The blond youth saluted Elhokar then hurried to take one of the vacant seats beside Dalinar Father Adolin said in a hushed tone have you heard what theyre saying About what About you Ive fought three duels so far against men who described youand our houseas cowards Theyre saying you asked the king to abandon the Vengeance Pact Dalinar gripped the table and nearly rose to his feet But he stopped himself Let them speak if they wish he said turning back to his meal stabbing a chunk of peppered chicken with his knife and raising it to his lips Did you really do it Adolin asked Is that what you talked about at the meeting with the king two days back It is Dalinar admitted That elicited a groan from Adolin I was worried already When I Adolin Dalinar interjected Do you trust me Adolin looked at him the youths eyes wide honest but pained I want to Storms Father I really want to What I am doing is important It must be done Adolin leaned in speaking softly And what if they are delusions What if youre justgetting old It was the first time someone had confronted him with it so directly I would be lying if I didnt admit that Id considered it but there was no sense in secondguessing myself I believe theyre real I feel theyre real But This is not the place for this discussion son Dalinar said We can talk of it later and I will listen toand consideryour objections I promise Adolin drew his lips to a line Very well You are right to be worried for our reputation Dalinar said resting an elbow on the table I had assumed that Elhokar would have the tact to keep our conversation quiet but I should have asked him to do so directly You were right about his reaction by the way I realized during the conversation he would never retreat so I changed to another tactic Which is Winning the war Dalinar said firmly No more scuffling over gemhearts No more patient indefinite siege We find a way to lure a large number of Parshendi onto the Plains then execute an ambush If we can kill a large enough number of them we destroy their capacity to wage war Failing that we find a way to strike at their center and kill or capture their leaders Even a chasmfiend stops fighting when its been decapitated The Vengeance Pact would be fulfilled and we could go home Adolin took a long moment considering then he nodded sharply All right No objections Dalinar asked Normally his elder son had plenty You just asked me to trust you Adolin said Besides striking harder at the Parshendi Thats a tactic I can get behind Well need a good plan thougha way to counter the very objections you yourself raised six years ago Dalinar nodded tapping the table with his finger Back then even I thought of us as separate princedoms If we had attacked the center individually each army alone wed have been surrounded and destroyed But if all ten armies went together With our Soulcasters to provide food with the soldiers carrying portable shelters to set up for highstorms Over a hundred and fifty thousand troops Let the Parshendi try to surround us then With the Soulcasters we could even create wood for bridges if we had to That would take a lot of trust Adolin said hesitantly He glanced down the high table toward Sadeas His expression darkened Wed be stuck out there together and isolated for days If the highprinces started squabbling midmarch it could be disastrous Well get them to work together first Dalinar said Were close closer than weve ever been Six years and not a single highprince has allowed his soldiers to skirmish against those of another Except back in Alethkar There they still fought meaningless battles over land rights or old offenses It was ridiculous but stopping the Alethi from warring was like trying to stop the winds from blowing Adolin was nodding Its a good plan Father Far better than talk of retreating They wont like giving up the plateau skirmishes though They like the game of it I know But if I can get one or two of them to start pooling soldiers and resources for plateau assaults it might be a step toward what well need for the future Id still rather find a way to lure a large force of Parshendi out onto the Plains and meet them on one of the larger plateaus but I havent yet been able to figure out how to do that Either way our separate armies will need to learn to work together And what do we do about what people are saying about you Ill release an official refutation Dalinar said Ill have to be careful not to make it sound like the king was in error while also explaining the truth Adolin sighed An official refutation Father Yes Why not fight a duel Adolin asked leaning in sounding eager Some stuffy pronouncement may explain your ideas but it wont make people feel them Pick someone who is naming you coward challenge them and remind everyone what a mistake it is to insult the Blackthorn I can not Dalinar said The Codes forbid it for one of my stature Adolin probably shouldnt be dueling either but Dalinar had not forced a complete prohibition on him Dueling was his life Well that and the women he courted Then charge me with the honor of our house Adolin said Ill duel them Ill face them with Plate and Blade and show them what your honor means That would be the same thing as me doing it son Adolin shook his head staring at Dalinar He seemed to be searching for something What Dalinar asked Im trying to decide Adolin said Which one has changed you most The visions the Codes or that book If theres any difference between them The Codes are separate from the other two Dalinar said They are a tradition of old Alethkar No Theyre related Father All three Theyre tied together in you somehow Dalinar thought on that for a moment Could the lad have a point Have I told you the story of the king carrying the boulder Yes Adolin said I have Twice And you made me listen to the passage being read another time Oh Well in that same section theres a passage about the nature of forcing people to follow you as opposed to letting them follow you We do too much forcing in Alethkar Dueling someone because they claim Im a coward doesnt change their beliefs It might stop them from making the claims but it doesnt change hearts I know Im right about this Youll just have to trust me on this as well Adolin sighed standing Well an official refutation is better than nothing I guess At least you havent given up on defending our honor entirely I never will Dalinar said I just need to be careful I can not afford to divide us any further He turned back to his meal stabbing his last piece of chicken with his knife and shoving it in his mouth Ill get back to the other island then Adolin said IWait is that Aunt Navani Dalinar looked up surprised to see Navani walking toward them Dalinar glanced at his plate His food was gone hed eaten the last bit without realizing it He sighed steeling himself and rose to greet her Mathana Dalinar said bowing and using the formal term for an older sister Navani was only three months his senior but it was still applicable Dalinar she said a faint smile on her lips And dear Adolin Adolin smiled broadly he rounded the table and hugged his aunt She rested her clothed safehand on his shoulder a gesture reserved only for family When did you return Adolin asked releasing her Just this afternoon And why did you return Dalinar asked stiffly I was under the impression that you were going to aid the queen in protecting the kings interests in Alethkar Oh Dalinar Navani said voice fond So stiff as always Adolin dear how goes courtship Dalinar snorted He continues to change partners like hes in a dance that involves particularly quick music Father Adolin objected Well good for you Adolin Navani said Youre too young to get tied down The purpose of youth is to experience variety while it is still interesting She glanced at Dalinar It isnt until we get older that we should be forced to be boring Thank you Aunt Adolin said with a grin Excuse me I need to go tell Renarin that youve returned He hurried away leaving Dalinar standing awkwardly across the table from Navani Am I that much of a threat Dalinar Navani asked raising an eyebrow at him Dalinar glanced down realizing that he was still gripping his dining knifea wide serrated blade that could double as a weapon in a pinch He let it clatter to the table then winced at the noise All of the confidence hed felt speaking with Adolin seemed gone in a heartbeat Compose yourself he thought Shes just family Every time he spoke with Navani he felt as if he were facing a predator of the most dangerous breed Mathana Dalinar said realizing they were still standing on opposite sides of the narrow table Perhaps we should move to He trailed off as Navani waved to an attending girl who was barely old enough to wear a womans sleeve The child rushed forward bearing a low stool Navani pointed to the spot beside her a spot only a few feet from the table The child hesitated but Navani pointed more insistently and the child set the stool down Navani sat gracefully not sitting at the kings tablewhich was a masculine dining placebut certainly sitting near enough to be challenging protocol The serving girl withdrew At the end of the table Elhokar noticed his mothers actions but said nothing One did not reprove Navani Kholin not even if one were king Oh sit down Dalinar she said voice growing testy We have matters of some moment to discuss Dalinar sighed but sat The seats around them were still empty and both the music and the hum of conversation on the island were loud enough to keep people from overhearing them Some women had taken to playing flutes musicspren spinning around them in the air You ask why I returned Navani said voice soft Well I have three reasons First I wanted to bring word that the Vedens have perfected their halfshards as they call them Theyre claiming the shields can stop blows from a Shardblade Dalinar folded his arms before him on the table Hed heard rumors of this though hed discounted them Men were always claiming to be close to creating new Shards yet the promises were never fulfilled Have you seen one No But I have confirmation from someone I trust She says they can only take the shape of a shield and dont lend any of Plates other enhancements But they can block a Shardblade It was a stepa very small steptoward Shardplate That was disturbing He wouldnt believe it himself until hed seen what these halfshards could do You could have sent this news via spanreed Navani Well I realized soon after reaching Kholinar that leaving here had been a political mistake More and more these warcamps are the true center of our kingdom Yes Dalinar said quietly Our absence from our homeland is dangerous Hadnt that been the very argument that had convinced Navani to go home in the first place The stately woman waved a dismissive hand I have determined that the queen is sufficiently endowed with the requisite skills needed to hold Alethkar There are schemes and plotsthere will always be schemes and plotsbut the truly important players inevitably make their way here Your son continues to see assassins around every corner Dalinar said softly And shouldnt he After what happened to his father True but I fear he carries it to extremes He mistrusts even his allies Navani folded her hands in her lap freehand lying atop safehand Hes not very good at this is he Dalinar blinked in shock What Elhokar is a good man He has more integrity than any other lighteyes in this army But his rule is weak Navani said You must admit that He is king Dalinar said firmly and my nephew He has both my sword and my heart Navani and I will not hear ill spoken of him even by his own mother She eyed him Was she testing his loyalty Much like her daughter Navani was a political creature Intrigue made her blossom like a rockbud in calm wet air However unlike Jasnah Navani was hard to trust At least with Jasnah one knew where one stoodonce again Dalinar found himself wishing shed put aside her projects and return to the Shattered Plains Im not speaking ill of my son Dalinar Navani said We both know I am as loyal to him as you are But I like to know what Im working with and that requires a definition He is seen as weak and I intend to see him protected Despite himself if necessary Then we work for the same goals But if protecting him was the second reason you returned what was the third She smiled a violeteyed redlipped smile at him A meaningful smile Blood of my ancestors Dalinar thought Stormwinds but shes beautiful Beautiful and deadly It seemed a particular irony to him that his wifes face had been erased from his mind and yet he could remember in complete and intricate detail the months this woman had spent toying with him and Gavilar Shed played them off one another fanning their desire before finally choosing the elder son Theyd all known the entire time that she would choose Gavilar It had hurt anyway We need to talk sometime in private Navani said I want to hear your opinion on some of the things being said in camp That probably meant the rumors about him IIm very busy She rolled her eyes Im sure you are Were meeting anyway once Ive had time to settle here and put out feelers How about one week from today Ill come read to you from that book of my husbands and afterward we can chat Well do it in a public place All right He sighed Very well But Highprinces and lighteyes Elhokars suddenly proclaimed Dalinar and Navani turned toward the end of the table where the king stood wearing his uniform complete with royal cape and crown He raised a hand toward the island The people hushed and soon the only sound was that of the water burbling through the streams Im sure many of you have heard the rumors regarding the attempt on my life during the hunt three days ago Elhokar announced When my saddle girth was cut Dalinar glanced at Navani She raised her freehand toward him and rocked it back and forth indicating that she didnt find the rumors to be persuasive She knew about the rumors of course Give Navani five minutes in a city and shed know anything and everything of significance being gossiped about I assure you I was never in real danger Elhokar said Thanks in part to the protection of the Kings Guard and the vigilance of my uncle However I believe it wise to treat all threats with due prudence and seriousness Therefore I am appointing Brightlord Torol Sadeas to be Highprince of Information charging him to unearth the truth regarding this attempt on my life Dalinar blinked in shock Then he closed his eyes and let out a soft groan Unearth the truth Navani said skeptically Sadeas Blood of myHe thinks Im ignoring the threats to him so hes looking to Sadeas instead Well I suppose thats all right she said I kind of trust Sadeas Navani Dalinar said opening his eyes The incident happened on a hunt I planned under the protection of my guard and my soldiers The kings horse was prepared by my grooms He publicly asked me to look into this strap business and now hes just taken the investigation away from me Oh dear She understood This was nearly the same thing as Elhokar proclaiming that he suspected Dalinar Any information Sadeas unearthed regarding this assassination attempt could only reflect unfavorably on Dalinar When Sadeass hatred of Dalinar and his love of Gavilar conflicted which would win But the vision It said to trust him Elhokar sat back down and the buzz of conversation resumed across the island at a higher pitch The king seemed oblivious of what he had just done Sadeas was smiling broadly He rose from his place bidding farewell to the king then began mingling You still argue he isnt a bad king Navani whispered My poor distracted oblivious boy Dalinar stood up then walked down the table to where the king continued to eat Elhokar looked up Ah Dalinar I suspect youll want to give Sadeas your aid Dalinar sat down Sadeass halfeaten meal still sat on the table brass plate scattered with chunks of meat and torn flatbread Elhokar Dalinar forced out I just spoke to you a few days ago I asked to be Highprince of War and you said it was too dangerous It is Elhokar said I spoke to Sadeas about it and he agreed The highprinces will never stand for someone being put over them in war Sadeas mentioned that if I started with something less threatening like appointing someone to Highprince of Information it might prepare the others for what you want to do Sadeas suggested this Dalinar said flatly Of course Elhokar said It is time we had a Highprince of Information and he specifically noted the cut girth as something he wanted to look into He knows youve always said you arent suited to these sorts of things Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought looking out at the center of the island where a group of lighteyes gathered around Sadeas Ive just been outmaneuvered Brilliantly The Highprince of Information had authority over criminal investigations particularly those of interest to the Crown In a way it was nearly as threatening as a Highprince of War but it wouldnt seem so to Elhokar All he saw was that he would finally have someone willing to listen to his paranoid fears Sadeas was a clever clever man Dont look so morose Uncle Elhokar said I had no idea youd want the position and Sadeas just seemed so excited at the idea Perhaps hell find nothing at all and the leather was simply worn out Youll be vindicated in always telling me that Im not in as much danger as I think I am Vindicated Dalinar asked softly still watching Sadeas Somehow I doubt that is likely You have accused me of arrogance in my quest You have accused me of perpetuating my grudge against Rayse and Bavadin Both accusations are true Kaladin stood up in the wagon bed scanning the landscape outside the camp as Rock and Teft put his plansuch as it wasinto action Back home the air had been drier If you went about on the day before a highstorm everything seemed desolate After storms plants soon pulled back into their shells trunks and hiding places to conserve water But here in the moister climate they lingered Many rockbuds never quite pulled into their shells completely Patches of grass were common The trees Sadeas harvested were concentrated in a forest to the north of the warcamps but a few strays grew on this plain They were enormous broadtrunked things that grew with a westward slant their thick finger like roots clawing into the stone andover the yearscracking and breaking the ground around them Kaladin hopped down from the cart His job was to hoist up stones and place them on the bed of the vehicle The other bridgemen brought them to him laying them in heaps nearby Bridgemen worked across the broad plain moving among rockbuds patches of grass and bunches of weeds that poked out from beneath boulders Those grew most heavily on the west side ready to pull back into their boulders shadow if a highstorm approached It was a curious effect as if each boulder were the head of an aged man with tufts of green and brown hair growing out from behind his ears Those tufts were extremely important for hidden among them were thin reeds known as knobweed Their rigid stalks were topped with delicate fronds that could retract into the stem The stems themselves were immobile but they were fairly safe growing behind boulders Some would be pulled free in each stormperhaps to attach themselves in a new location once the winds abated Kaladin hoisted a rock setting it on the bed of the wagon and rolling it beside some others The rocks bottom was wet with lichen and crem Knobweed wasnt rare but neither was it as common as other weeds A quick description had been enough to send Rock and Teft searching with some success The breakthrough however had happened when Syl had joined the hunt Kaladin glanced to the side as he stepped down for another stone She zipped around a faint nearly invisible form leading Rock from one stand of reeds to another Teft didnt understand how the large Horn eater could consistently find so many more than he did but Kaladin didnt feel inclined to explain He still didnt understand why Rock could see Syl in the first place The Horneater said it was something hed been born with A pair of bridgemen approached youthful Dunny and Earless Jaks towing a wooden sled bearing a large stone Sweat trickled down the sides of their faces As they reached the wagon Kaladin dusted off his hands and helped them lift the boulder Earless Jaks scowled at him muttering under his breath Thats a nice one Kaladin said nodding to the stone Good work Jaks glared at him and stalked off Dunny gave Kaladin a shrug then hurried after the older man As Rock had guessed getting the crew assigned to stonegathering duty had not helped Kaladins popularity But it had to be done It was the only way to help Leyten and the other wounded Once Jaks and Dunny left Kaladin nonchalantly climbed into the wagon bed and knelt down pushing aside a tarp and uncovering a large pile of knobweed stems They were about as long as a mans forearm He made as if he were moving stones around in the bed but instead tied a large double handful of the reeds into a bundle using thin rockbud vines He dropped the bundle over the side of the wagon The wagon driver had gone to chat with his counterpart on the other wagon That left Kaladin alone save for the chull that sat hunkered down in its rock shell watching the sun with beady crustacean eyes Kaladin hopped down from the wagon and placed another rock in the bed Then he knelt as if to pull a large stone out from under the wagon With deft hands however he tied the reeds into place underneath the bed right beside two other bundles The wagon had a large open space to the side of the axle and a wood dowel there provided an excellent place for mounting the bundles Jezerezeh send that nobody thinks to check the bottom as we roll back into camp The apothecary said one drop came per stem How many reeds would Kaladin need He felt he knew the answer to that question without even giving it much thought Hed need every drop he could get He climbed out and lifted another stone into the wagon Rock was approaching the large tanskinned Horneater carried an oblong stone that would have been too large for most of the bridgemen to handle alone Rock shuffled forward slowly Syl zipping around his head and occasionally landing on the rock to watch him Kaladin climbed down and trotted across the uneven ground to help Rock nodded in thanks Together they hauled the stone to the wagon and set it down on the bed Rock wiped his brow turning his back to Kaladin Sprouting from his pocket was a handful of reeds Kaladin swiped them and tucked them beneath the tarp What do we do if someone notices this thing we are doing Rock asked casually Explain that Im a weaver Kaladin said and that I thought Id weave myself a hat to keep off the sun Rock snorted I might do just that Kaladin said He wiped his brow It would be nice in this heat But best nobody sees The mere fact that we want the reeds would probably be enough to make them deny them to us This thing is true Rock said stretching and glancing upward as Syl zipped over in front of him I miss the Peaks Syl pointed and Rock bowed his head in reverence before following after her Once she had him going in the right direction however she flitted back to Kaladin bobbing up into the air as a ribbon then falling down to the side of the wagon and reforming her womanly shape her dress fluttering around her I she declared raising a finger like him very much Who Rock Yes she said folding her arms He is respectful Unlike others Fine Kaladin said lifting another stone into the wagon You can follow him around instead of bothering me He tried not to show worry as he said it He had grown accustomed to her company She sniffed I cant follow him Hes too respectful You just said you liked that I do Also I detest it She said that with unaffected frankness as if oblivious of the contradiction She sighed sitting down on the side of the wagon I led him to a patch of chull dung as a prank He didnt even yell at me He just looked at it as if trying to figure out some hidden meaning She grimaced Thats not normal I think the Horneaters must worship spren or something Kaladin said wiping his brow Thats silly People believe much sillier things In some ways I guess it makes sense to revere the spren You are kind of odd and magical Im not odd she said standing up Im beautiful and articulate She planted her hands on her hips but he could see in her expression that she wasnt really mad She seemed to be changing by the hour growing more and more More and more what Not exactly humanlike More individual Smarter Syl fell silent as another bridgemanNatamapproached The longfaced man was carrying a smaller stone obviously trying not to strain himself Ho Natam Kaladin said reaching down to take the stone How goes the work Natam shrugged Didnt you say you were once a farmer Natam rested beside the wagon ignoring Kaladin Kaladin set down the rock moving it into place Im sorry to make us work like this but we need the good will of Gaz and the other bridge crews Natam didnt respond It will help keep us alive Kaladin said Trust me Natam just shrugged yet again then wandered away Kaladin sighed This would be a lot easier if I could pin the duty change on Gaz That wouldnt be very honest Syl said affronted Why do you care so much about honesty I just do Oh Kaladin said grunting as he moved back to his work And leading men to piles of dung How honest is that Thats different It was a joke I fail to see how He trailed off as another bridgeman approached Kaladin doubted anyone else had Rocks strange ability to see Syl and didnt want to be seen talking to himself The short wiry bridgeman had said his name was Skar though Kaladin couldnt see any obvious scars on his face He had short dark hair and angular features Kaladin tried to engage him in conversation too but got no response The man even went so far as to give Kaladin a rude gesture before tromping back out Im doing something wrong Kaladin said shaking his head and hopping down from the sturdy wagon Wrong Syl stepped up to the lip of the wagon watching him I thought that seeing me rescue those three might give them hope But theyre still indifferent Some watched you run earlier Syl said when you were practicing with the plank They watched Kaladin said But they dont care about helping the wounded Nobody besides Rock that isand hes only doing it because he has a debt to me Even Teft wasnt willing to share his food Theyre selfish No I dont think that word can apply to them He lifted a stone struggling to explain how he felt When I was a slavewell Im still a slave But during the worst parts when my masters were trying to beat out of me the ability to resist I was like these men I didnt care enough to be selfish I was like an animal I just did what I did without thinking Syl frowned Little wonderKaladin himself didnt understand what he was saying Yet as he spoke he began to work out what he meant Ive shown them that we can survive but that doesnt mean anything If those lives arent worth living then they arent ever going to care Its like Im offering them piles of spheres but not giving them anything to spend their wealth on I guess Syl said But what can you do He looked back across the plain of rock toward the warcamp The smoke of the armys many cookfires rose from the craters I dont know But I think were going to need a lot more reeds That night Kaladin Teft and Rock walked the makeshift streets of Sadeass warcamp Nomonthe middle moonshone with his pale bluewhite light Oil lanterns hung in front of buildings indicating taverns or brothels Spheres could provide more consistent renewable light but you could buy a bundle of candles or a pouch of oil for a single sphere In the short run it was often cheaper to do that particularly if you were hanging your lights in a place they could be stolen Sadeas didnt enforce a curfew but Kaladin had learned that a lone bridgeman had best remain in the lumberyard at night Halfdrunken soldiers in stained uniforms sauntered past whispering in the ears of whores or boasting to their friends They called insults at the bridgemen laughing riotously The streets felt dark even with the lanterns and the moonlight and the haphazard nature of the campsome stone structures some wooden shanties some tentsmade it feel disorganized and dangerous Kaladin and his two companions stepped aside for a large group of soldiers Their coats were unbuttoned and they were only mildly drunk A soldier eyed the bridgemen but the three of them togetherone of them being a brawny Horneaterwere enough to dissuade the soldier from doing more than laughing and shoving Kaladin as he passed The man smelled of sweat and cheap ale Kaladin kept his temper Fight back and hed be docked pay for brawling I dont like this Teft said glancing over his shoulder at the group of soldiers Im going back to the camp You will be staying Rock growled Teft rolled his eyes You think Im scared of a lumbering chull like you Ill go if I want to and Teft Kaladin said softly We need you Need That word had strange effects on men Some ran when you used it Others grew nervous Teft seemed to long for it He nodded muttering to himself but stayed with them as they went on They soon reached the wagonyard The fencedoff square of rock was near the western side of the camp It was deserted for the night the wagons sitting in long lines Chulls lay slumbering in the nearby pen looking like small hills Kaladin crept forward wary of sentries but apparently nobody worried about something as large as a wagon being stolen from the middle of the army Rock nudged him then pointed to the shadowy chull pens A lone boy sat upon a pen post staring up at the moon Chulls were valuable enough to watch over Poor lad How often was he required to wait up nights guarding the sluggish beasts Kaladin crouched down beside a wagon the other two mimicking him He pointed down one row and Rock moved off Kaladin pointed the other direction and Teft rolled his eyes but did as asked Kaladin sneaked down the middle row There were about thirty wagons ten per row but checking was quick A brush of the fingers against the back plank looking for the mark hed made there After just a few minutes a shadowed figure entered Kaladins row Rock The Horneater gestured to the side and held up five fingers Fifth wagon from the top Kaladin nodded and moved off Just as he reached the indicated wagon he heard a soft yelp from the direction Teft had gone Kaladin flinched then peeked up toward the sentry The boy was still watching the moon kicking his toes absently against the post next to him A moment later Rock and a sheepish Teft scurried up to Kaladin Sorry Teft whispered The walking mountain startled me If I am being a mountain Rock grumbled then why werent you hearing me coming Eh Kaladin snorted feeling the back of the indicated wagon fingers brushing the X mark in the wood He took a breath then climbed under the wagon on his back The reeds were still there tied in twenty bundles each about as thick as a handspan Ishi Herald of Luck be praised he whispered untying the first bundle All there eh Teft said leaning down scratching at his beard in the moonlight Cant believe we found so many Must have pulled up every reed on the entire plain Kaladin handed him the first bundle Without Syl they wouldnt have found a third this many She had the speed of an insect in flight and she seemed to have a sense of where to find things Kaladin untied the next bundle handing it out Teft tied it to the other making a larger bundle As Kaladin worked a flurry of small white leaves blew under the wagon and formed into Syls figure She slid to a stop beside his head No guards anywhere I could see Just a boy in the chull pens Her whiteblue translucent figure was nearly invisible in the darkness I hope these reeds are still good Kaladin whispered If they dried out too much Theyll be fine You worry like a worrier I found you some bottles You did he asked so eager that he nearly sat up He caught himself before smacking his head Syl nodded Ill show you I couldnt carry them Too solid Kaladin quickly untied the rest of the bundles handing them out to the nervous Teft Kaladin scooted out then took two of the larger tiedtogether bundles of three Teft took two of the others and Rock managed three by tucking one under his arm Theyd need a place to work where they wouldnt be interrupted Even if the knobweed seemed worthless Gaz would find a way to ruin the work if he saw what was happening Bottle first Kaladin thought He nodded to Syl who led them out of the wagonyard and to a tavern It looked to have been hastily built from secondrate lumber but that didnt stop the soldiers inside from enjoying themselves Their rowdiness made Kaladin worry about the entire building collapsing Behind it in a splintery halfcrate lay a pile of discarded liquor bottles Glass was precious enough that whole bottles would be reused but these had cracks or broken tops Kaladin set down his bundles then selected three nearly whole bottles He washed them in a nearby water barrel before tucking them into a sack hed brought for the purpose He picked up his bundles again nodding to the others Try to look like youre doing something monotonous he said Bow your heads The other two nodded and they walked out into a main road carrying the bundles as if on some work detail They drew far less attention than they had before They avoided the lumberyard proper crossing the open field of rock used as the armys staging area before walking down the slope of rock leading to the Shattered Plains A sentry saw them and Kaladin held his breath but he said nothing He probably assumed from their postures that they had a reason to be doing what they were If they tried to leave the warcamp it would be a different story but this section down near the first few chasms wasnt off limits Before long they approached the place where Kaladin had nearly killed himself What a difference a few days could make He felt like a different persona strange hybrid of the man he had once been the slave hed become and the pitiful wretch he still had to fight off He remembered standing on the edge of the chasm looking down That darkness still terrified him If I fail to save the bridgemen that wretch will take control again This time hell get his way That gave Kaladin a shiver He set his bundles down beside the chasm ledge then sat The other two followed more hesitantly Were going to toss them into the chasm Teft asked scratching his beard After all that work Of course not Kaladin said He hesitated Nomon was bright but it was still night You dont have any spheres do you Why Teft asked suspicious For light Teft Teft grumbled pulling out a handful of garnet chips Was going to spend these tonight he said They glowed in his palm All right Kaladin said slipping out a reed What had his father said about these Hesitantly Kaladin broke off the furry top of the reed exposing the hollow center He took the reed by the other end and ran his fingers down its length squeezing it tight Two drops of milky white liquid dripped into the empty liquor bottle Kaladin smiled in satisfaction then squeezed his fingers along the length again Nothing came out this time so he tossed the reed into the chasm For all his talk of hats he didnt want to leave evidence I thought you said we arent throwing them in Teft accused Kaladin held up the liquor bottle Only after we have this out What is it Rock leaned closer squinting Knobweed sap Or rather knobweed milkI dont think its really sap Anyway its a powerful antiseptic Antiwhat Teft asked It scares away rotspren Kaladin said They cause infection This milk is one of the best antiseptics there is Spread it on a wound thats already infected and it will still work That was good because Leytens wounds had begun to turn an angry red rotspren crawling all over Teft grunted then glanced at the bundles There are a lot of reeds here I know Kaladin said handing over the other two bottles Thats why Im glad I dont have to milk them all on my own Teft sighed but sat down and untied a bundle Rock did so without the complaining sitting with his knees bent to the sides feet pressed together to hold the bottle as he worked A faint breeze blew up rattling some of the reeds Why do you care about them Teft finally asked Theyre my men Thats not what being bridgeleader means It means whatever we decide Kaladin said noting that Syl had come over to listen You me the others You think theyll let you do that Teft asked The lighteyes and the captains You think theyll pay enough attention to even notice Teft hesitated then grunted milking another reed Perhaps they will Rock said There was a surprising level of delicacy to the large mans motions as he milked the reeds Kaladin hadnt thought those thick fingers would be so careful so precise Lighteyes they are often noticing those things that you wish they would not Teft grunted again agreeing How did you come here Rock Kaladin asked How does a Horneater end up leaving his mountains and coming to the lowlands You shouldnt ask those kinds of things son Teft said wagging a finger at Kaladin We dont talk about our pasts We dont talk about anything Kaladin said You two didnt even know each others names Names are one thing Teft grumbled Backgrounds theyre different I Is all right Rock said I will speak of this thing Teft muttered to himself but he did lean forward to listen when Rock spoke My people have no Shardblades Rock said in his low rumbling voice Thats not unusual Kaladin said Other than Alethkar and Jah Keved few kingdoms have many Blades It was a matter of some pride among the armies This thing is not true Rock said Thaylenah has five Blades and three full suits of Plate all held by the royal guards The Selay have their share of both suits and Blades Other kingdoms such as Herdaz have a single Blade and set of Platethis is passed down through the royal line But the Unkalaki we have not a single Shard Many of our nuatomathis thing it is the same as your lighteyes only their eyes are not light How can you be a lighteyes without light eyes Teft said with a scowl By having dark eyes Rock said as if it were obvious We do not pick our leaders this way Is complicated But do not interrupt story He milked another reed tossing the husk into a pile beside him The nuatoma they see our lack of Shards as great shame They want these weapons very badly It is believed that the nuatoma who first obtains a Shardblade would become king a thing we have not had for many years No peak would fight another peak where a man held one of the blessed Blades So you came to buy one Kaladin asked No Shardbearer would sell his weapon Each was a distinctive relic taken from one of the Lost Radiants after their betrayal Rock laughed Ha Buy No we are not so foolish as this But my nuatoma he knew of your tradition eh It says that if a man kills a Shardbearer he may take the Blade and Plate as his own And so my nuatoma and his house we made a grand procession coming down to find and kill one of your Shardbearers Kaladin almost laughed I assume it proved more difficult than that My nuatoma was not a fool Rock said defensive He knew this thing would be difficult but your tradition it gives us hope you see Occasionally a brave nuatoma will come down to duel a Shardbearer Someday one will win and we will have Shards Perhaps Kaladin said tossing an empty reed into the chasm Assuming they agree to duel you in a bout to the death Oh they always duel Rock said laughing The nuatoma brings many riches and promises all of his possessions to the victor Your lighteyes they can not pass by a pond so warm To kill an Unkalaki with no Shardblade they do not see this thing as difficult Many nuatoma have died But is all right Eventually we will win And have one set of Shards Kaladin said Alethkar has dozens One is a beginning Rock said shrugging But my nuatoma lost so I am bridgeman Wait Teft said You came all of this way with your brightlord and once he lost you up and joined a bridge crew No no you do not see Rock said My nuatoma he challenged Highprince Sadeas Is well known that there are many Shardbearers here on Shattered Plains My nuatoma thought it easier to fight man with only Plate first then win Blade next And Teft said Once my nuatoma lost to Brightlord Sadeas all of us became his So youre a slave Kaladin asked reaching up and feeling the marks on his forehead No we do not have this thing Rock said I was not a slave of my nuatoma I was his family His family Teft said Kelek Youre a lighteyes Rock laughed again loud and fullbellied Kaladin smiled despite himself It seemed like so long since hed heard someone laugh like that No no I was only umartiahis cousin you would say Still you were related to him On the Peaks Rock said the relatives of a brightlord are his servants What kind of system is that Teft complained You have to be a servant to your own relatives Storm me Id rather die I think I would It is not so bad Rock said You dont know my relatives Teft said shivering Rock laughed again You would rather serve someone you do not know Like this Sadeas A man who is no relation to you He shook his head Lowlanders You have too much air here Makes your minds sick Too much air Kaladin asked Yes Rock said How can you have too much air Its all around This thing it is difficult to explain Rocks Alethi was good but he sometimes forget to add in common words Other times he remembered them speaking his sentences precisely The faster he spoke the more words he forgot to put in You have too much air Rock said Come to the Peaks You will see I guess Kaladin said shooting a glance at Teft who just shrugged But youre wrong about one thing You said that we serve someone we dont know Well I do know Brightlord Sadeas I know him well Rock raised an eyebrow Arrogant Kaladin said vengeful greedy corrupt to the core Rock smiled Yes I think you are right This man is not among the finest of lighteyes There are no finest among them Rock Theyre all the same They have done much to you then Kaladin shrugged the question uncovering wounds that werent yet healed Anyway your master was lucky Lucky to be slain by a Shardbearer Lucky he didnt win Kaladin said and discover how hed been tricked They wouldnt have let him walk away with Sadeass Plate Nonsense Teft broke in Tradition Tradition is the blind witness they use to condemn us Teft Kaladin said Its the pretty box they use to wrap up their lies It makes us serve them Teft set his jaw Ive lived a lot longer than you son I know things If a common man killed an enemy Shardbearer hed become a lighteyes Thats the way of it He let the argument lapse If Tefts illusions made him feel better about his place in this mess of a war then who was Kaladin to dissuade him So you were a servant Kaladin said to Rock In a brightlords retinue What kind of servant He struggled for the right word remembering back to the times hed interacted with Wistiow or Roshone A footman A butler Rock laughed I was cook My nuatoma would not come down to the lowlands without his own cook Your food here it has so many spices that you can not taste anything else Might as well be eating stones powdered with pepper You should talk about food Teft said scowling A Horneater Kaladin frowned Why do they call your people that anyway Because they eat the horns and shells of the things they catch Teft said The outsides Rock smiled with a look of longing Ah but the taste is so good You actually eat the shells Kaladin asked We have very strong teeth Rock said proudly But there You now know my story Brightlord Sadeas he wasnt certain what he should do with most of us Some were made soldiers others serve in his house hold I fixed him one meal and he sent me to bridge crews Rock hesitated I may have uh enhanced the soup Enhanced Kaladin asked raising an eyebrow Rock seemed to grow embarrassed You see I was quite angry about my nuatomas death And I thought these lowlanders their tongues are all scorched and burned by the food they eat They have no taste and And what Kaladin asked Chull dung Rock said It apparently has stronger taste than I assumed Wait Teft said You put chull dung in Highprince Sadeass soup Er yes Rock said Actually I put this thing in his bread too And used it as a garnish on the pork steak And made a chutney out of it for the buttered garams Chull dung it has many uses I found Teft laughed his voice echoing He fell on his side so amused that Kaladin was afraid hed roll right into the chasm Horneater Teft finally said I owe you a drink Rock smiled Kaladin shook his head to himself amazed It suddenly made sense What Rock said apparently noticing his expression This is what we need Kaladin said This Its the thing Ive been missing Rock hesitated Chull dung This is the thing you need Teft burst into another round of laugher No Kaladin said Itswell Ill show you But first we need this knobweed sap Theyd barely made their way through one of the bundles and already his fingers were aching from the milking What of you Kaladin Rock asked I have been telling you my story You will tell me yours How did you come to those marks on your forehead Yeah Teft said wiping his eyes Whose food did you trat in I thought you said it was taboo to ask about a bridgemans past Kaladin said You made Rock share son Teft said Its only fair So if I tell my story that means youll tell yours Teft scowled immediately Now look I aint going to I killed a man Kaladin said That quieted Teft Rock perked up Syl Kaladin noticed was still watching with interest That was odd for her normally her attention wavered quickly You killed a man Rock said And after this thing they made you a slave Is not the punishment for murder usually death It wasnt murder Kaladin said softly thinking of the scraggly bearded man in the slave wagon who had asked him these same questions In fact I was thanked for it by someone very important He fell silent And Teft finally asked And Kaladin said looking down at a reed Nomon was setting in the west and the small green disk of Mishimthe final moonwas rising in the east And it turns out that lighteyes dont react very well when you turn down their gifts The others waited for more but Kaladin fell silent working on his reeds It shocked him how painful it still was to remember those events back in Amarams army Either the others sensed his mood or they felt what hed said was enough for they each turned back to their work and prodded no further Neither point makes the things I have written to you here untrue The kings Gallery of Maps balanced beauty and function The expansive domed structure of Soulcast stone had smooth sides that melded seamlessly with the rocky ground It was shaped like a long loaf of Thaylen bread and had large skylights in the ceiling allowing the sun to shine down on handsome formations of shalebark Dalinar passed one of these pinks and vibrant greens and blues growing in a gnarled pattern as high as his shoulders The crusty hard plants had no true stalks or leaves just waving tendrils like colorful hair Except for those shalebark seemed more rock than vegetation And yet scholars said it must be a plant for the way it grew and reached toward the light Men did that too he thought Once Highprince Roion stood in front of one of the maps hands clasped behind his back his numerous attendants clogging the other side of the gallery Roion was a tall lightskinned man with a dark welltrimmed beard He was thinning on top Like most of the others he wore a short openfronted jacket exposing the shirt underneath Its red fabric poked out above the jackets collar So sloppy Dalinar thought though it was very fashionable Dalinar just wished that current fashion werent so well sloppy Brightlord Dalinar Roion said I have difficulty seeing the point of this meeting Walk with me Brightlord Roion Dalinar said nodding to the side The other man sighed but joined Dalinar and walked the pathway between the clusters of plants and the wall of maps Roions attendants followed they included both a cupbearer and a shieldbearer Each map was illuminated by diamonds their enclosures made of mirrorpolished steel The maps were inked in detail onto unnaturally large seamless sheets of parchment Such parchment was obviously Soulcast Near the center of the chamber they came to the Prime Map an enormous detailed map fixed in a frame on the wall It showed the entirety of the Shattered Plains that had been explored Permanent bridges were drawn in red and plateaus close to the Alethi side had blue glyphpairs on them indicating which highprince controlled them The eastern section of the map grew less detailed until the lines vanished In the middle was the contested area the section of plateaus where the chasmfiends most often came to make their chrysalises Few came to the near side where the permanent bridges were If they did come it was to hunt not to pupate Controlling the nearby plateaus was still important as a highprinceby agreementcould not cross a plateau maintained by one of the others unless he had permission That determined who had the best pathways to the central plateaus and it also determined who had to maintain the watchposts and permanent bridges on that plateau Those plateaus were bought and sold among the highprinces A second sheet of parchment to the side of the Prime Map listed each highprince and the number of gemhearts he had won It was a very Alethi thing to domaintain motivation by making it very clear who was winning and who lagged behind Roions eyes immediately went to his own name on the list Of all the highprinces Roion had won the fewest gemhearts Dalinar reached his hand up to the Prime Map brushing the parchment The middle plateaus were named or numbered for ease of reference Foremost of them was a large plateau that stood defiantly near the Parshendi side The Tower it was called An unusually massive and oddly shaped plateau that the chasmfiends seemed particularly fond of using as a spot for pupating Looking at it gave him pause The size of a contested plateau determined the number of troops you could field on it The Parshendi usually brought a large force to the Tower and they had rebuffed the Alethi assaults there twentyseven times now No Alethi had ever won a skirmish upon it Dalinar had been turned back there twice himself It was just too close to the Parshendi they could always get there first and form up using the slope to give them excellent high ground But if we could corner them there he thought with a large enough force of our own It could mean trapping and killing a huge number of Parshendi troops Maybe enough of them to break their ability to wage war on the Plains It was something to consider Before that could happen however Dalinar would need alliances He ran his fingers westward Highprince Sadeas has been doing very well lately Dalinar tapped Sadeass warcamp Hes been buying plateaus from other highprinces making it easier and easier for him to get to the battlefields first Yes Roion said frowning One hardly needs to see a map to know that Dalinar Look at the scope of it Dalinar said Six years of continuous fighting and nobody has even seen the center of the Shattered Plains Thats never been the point We hold them in besiege them starve them out and force them to come to us Wasnt that your plan Yes but I never imagined it would take this long Ive been thinking that it might be time to change tactics Why This one works Hardly a week goes by without a couple of clashes with the Parshendi Though might I point out that you have hardly been a model of inspiration in battle lately He nodded to Dalinars name on the smaller sheet There were a good number of scratches next to his name noting gemhearts won But very few of them were fresh There are some who say the Blackthorn has lost his sting Roion said He was careful not to insult Dalinar outright but he went further than he once would have News of Dalinars actions while trapped in the barrack had spread Dalinar forced himself to be calm Roion we can not continue to treat this war as a game All wars are games The greatest kind with the pieces lost real lives the prizes captured making for real wealth This is the life for which men exist To fight to kill to win He was quoting the Sunmaker the last Alethi king to unite the highprinces Gavilar had once revered his name Perhaps Dalinar said Yet what is the point We fight to get Shardblades then use those Shardblades to fight to get more Shardblades Its a circle round and round we go chasing our tails so we can be better at chasing our tails We fight to prepare ourselves to reclaim heaven and take back what is ours Men can train without going to war and men can fight without it being meaningless It wasnt always this way There were times when our wars meant something Roion raised an eyebrow Youre almost making me believe the rumors Dalinar They say youve lost your taste for combat that you no longer have the will to fight He eyed Dalinar again Some are saying that it is time to abdicate in favor of your son The rumors are wrong Dalinar snapped That is They are wrong Dalinar said firmly if they claim that I no longer care He rested his fingers on the surface of the map again running them across the smooth parchment I care Roion I care deeply About this people About my nephew About the future of this war And that is why I suggest we pursue an aggressive course from now on Well that is good to hear I suppose Unite them I want you to try a joint plateau assault with me Dalinar said What I want the two of us to try coordinating our efforts and attack at the same time working together Why would we want to do that We could increase our chances of winning gemhearts If more troops increased my chances of winning Roion said then Id just bring more of my own The plateaus are too small for fielding large armies and mobility is more important than sheer numbers It was a valid point on the Plains more didnt necessarily mean better Close confines and a requisite forced march to the battlefield changed warfare significantly The exact number of troops used depended on the size of the plateau and the highprinces personal martial philosophy Working together wouldnt just be about fielding more troops Dalinar said Each highprinces army has different strengths Im known for my heavy infantry you have the best archers Sadeass bridges are the fastest Working together we could try new tactics We expend too much effort getting to the plateau in haste If we werent so rushed competing against one another maybe we could surround the plateau We could try letting the Parshendi arrive first then assault them on our terms not theirs Roion hesitated Dalinar had spent days deliberating with his generals about the possibility of a joint assault It seemed that there would be distinct advantages but they wouldnt know for certain until someone tried it with him He actually seemed to be considering Who would get the gemheart We split the wealth equally Dalinar said And if we capture a Shardblade The man who won it would get it obviously And thats most likely to be you Roion said frowning As you and your son already have Shards It was the great problem of Shardblades and Shardplatewinning either was highly unlikely unless you already had Shards yourself In fact having only one or the other often wasnt enough Sadeas had faced Parshendi Shardbearers on the field and had always been forced to retreat lest he be slain himself Im certain we could arrange something more equitable Dalinar finally said If he won Shards hed been hoping to be able to give them to Renarin Im sure Roion said skeptically Dalinar drew in a breath He needed to be bolder What if I offer them to you Excuse me We try a joint attack If I win a Shardblade or Plate you get the first set But I keep the second Roions eyes narrowed Youd do that On my honor Roion Well nobody would doubt that But can you blame a man for being wary Of what I am a highprince Dalinar Roion said My princedom is the smallest true but I am my own man I would not see myself subordinated to someone greater Youve already become part of something greater Dalinar thought with frustration That happened the moment you swore fealty to Gavilar Roion and the others refused to make good on their promises Our kingdom can be so much more than it is Roion Perhaps But perhaps Im satisfied with what I have Either way you make an interesting proposal I shall have to think on it further Very well Dalinar said but his instinct said that Roion would decline the offer The man was too suspicious The highprinces barely trusted one another enough to work together when there werent Shardblades and gems at stake Will I be seeing you at the feast this evening Roion asked Why wouldnt you Dalinar asked with a sigh Well the stormwardens have been saying that there could be a highstorm tonight you see I will be there Dalinar said flatly Yes of course Roion said chuckling No reason why you wouldnt be He smiled at Dalinar and withdrew his attendants following Dalinar sighed turning to study the Prime Map thinking through the meeting and what it meant He stood there for a long time Looking down on the Plains as if a god far above The plateaus looked like close islands or perhaps jagged pieces set in a massive stainedglass window Not for the first time he felt as if he should be able to make out a pattern to the plateaus If he could see more of them perhaps What would it mean if there was an order to the chasms Everyone else was so concerned with looking strong with proving themselves Was he really the only one who saw how frivolous that was Strength for strengths sake What good was strength unless you did something with it Alethkar was a light once he thought Thats what Gavilars book claims thats what the visions are showing me Nohadon was king of Alethkar so long ago In the time before the Heralds left Dalinar felt as if he could almost see it The secret The thing that had made Gavilar so excited in the months before his death If Dalinar could just stretch a little farther hed make it out See the pattern in the lives of men And finally know But that was what hed been doing for the last six years Grasping stretching reaching just a little farther The farther he reached the more distant those answers seemed to become Adolin stepped into the Gallery of Maps His father was still there standing alone Two members of the Cobalt Guard watched over him from a distance Roion was nowhere to be seen Adolin approached slowly His father had that look in his eyes the absent one he got so often lately Even when he wasnt having an episode he wasnt entirely here Not in the way he once had been Father Adolin said stepping up to him Hello Adolin How was the meeting with Roion Adolin asked trying to sound cheerful Disappointing Im proving far worse at diplomacy than I once was at warmaking Theres no profit in peace Thats what everyone says But we had peace once and seemed to do just fine Better even There hasnt been peace since the Tranquiline Halls Adolin said immediately Mans life on Roshar is conflict It was a quotation from The Arguments Dalinar turned to Adolin looking amused Quoting scripture at me You Adolin shrugged feeling foolish Well you see Malasha is rather religious and so earlier today I was listening to Wait Dalinar said Malasha Whos that Daughter of Brightlord Seveks And that other girl Janala Adolin grimaced thinking back to the disastrous walk theyd gone on the other day Several nice gifts had yet to repair that She didnt seem half as excited about him now that he wasnt courting someone else Things are rocky Malasha seems like a better prospect He moved on quickly I take it that Roion wont soon be going on any plateau assault with us Dalinar shook his head Hes too afraid that Im trying to maneuver him into a position where I can seize his lands Perhaps it was wrong to approach the weakest highprince first Hed rather hunker down and try to weather what comes at him holding what he has as opposed to making a risky play for something greater Dalinar stared at the map looking distant again Gavilar dreamed of unifying Alethkar Once I thought hed achieved it despite what he claimed The longer I work with these men the more I realize that Gavilar was right We failed We defeated these men but we never unified them So you still intend to approach the others I do I only need one to say yes in order to start Who do you think we should go to next Im not sure Adolin said But for now I think you should know something Sadeas has sent to us asking permission to enter our warcamp He wants to interview the grooms who cared for His Majestys horse during the hunt His new position gives him the right to make those kinds of demands Father Adolin said stepping closer speaking softly I think hes going to move against us Dalinar looked at him I know you trust him Adolin said quickly And I understand your reasons now But listen to me This move puts him in an ideal position to undermine us The king has grown paranoid enough that hes suspicious even of you and meI know youve seen it All Sadeas needs to do is find imaginary evidence linking us to an attempt to kill the king and hell be able be able to turn Elhokar against us We may have to risk that Adolin frowned But I trust Sadeas son Dalinar said But even if I didnt we couldnt forbid him entry or block his investigation Wed not only look guilty in the kings eyes but wed be denying his authority as well He shook his head If I ever want the other highprinces to accept me as their leader in war I have to be willing to allow Sadeas his authority as Highprince of Information I cant rely upon the old traditions for my authority yet deny Sadeas the same right I suppose Adolin admitted But we could still prepare You cant tell me youre not a little worried Dalinar hesitated Perhaps This maneuver of Sadeass is aggressive But Ive been told what to do Trust Sadeas Be strong Act with honor and honor will aid you That is the advice Ive been given From where Dalinar looked to him and it became obvious to Adolin So were betting the future of our house on these visions now Adolin said flatly I wouldnt say that Dalinar replied If Sadeas did move against us I wouldnt simply let him shove us over But Im also not going to make the first move against him Because of what youve seen Adolin said growing frustrated Father you said youd listen to what I had to say about the visions Well please listen now This isnt the proper place You always have an excuse Adolin said Ive tried to approach you about it five times now and you always rebuff me Perhaps its because I know what youll say Dalinar said And I know it wont do any good Or perhaps its because you dont want to be confronted by the truth Thats enough Adolin No no its not Were mocked in every one of the warcamps our authority and reputation diminishes by the day and you refuse to do anything substantial about it Adolin I will not take this from my son But youll take it from everyone else Why is that Father When others say things about us you let them But when Renarin or I take the smallest step toward what you view as being inappropriate were immediately chastised Everyone else can speak lies but I cant speak the truth Do your sons mean so little to you Dalinar froze looking as if hed been slapped You arent well Father Adolin continued Part of him realized that he had gone too far that he was speaking too loudly but it boiled out anyway We need to stop tiptoeing around it You need to stop making up increasingly irrational explanations to reason away your lapses I know its hard to accept but sometimes people get old Sometimes the mind stops working right I dont know whats wrong Maybe its your guilt over Gavilars death That book the Codes the visionsmaybe theyre all attempts to find escape find redemption something What you see is not real Your life now is a rationalization a way of trying to pretend that whats happening isnt happening But Ill go to Damnation itself before Ill let you drag the entire house down without speaking my mind on it He practically shouted those last words They echoed in the large chamber and Adolin realized he was shaking He had never in all his years of life spoken to his father in such a way You think I havent wondered these things Dalinar said his voice cold his eyes hard Ive gone through each point youve made a dozen times over Then maybe you should go over them a few more I must trust myself The visions are trying to show me something important I can not prove it or explain how I know But its true Of course you think that Adolin said exasperated Dont you see Thats exactly what you would feel Men are very good at seeing what they want to Look at the king He sees a killer in every shadow and a worn strap becomes a convoluted plot to take his life Dalinar fell silent again Sometimes the simple answers are the right ones Father Adolin said The kings strap just wore out And youyoure seeing things that arent there Im sorry They locked expressions Adolin didnt look away He wouldnt look away Dalinar finally turned from him Leave me please All right Fine But I want you to think about this I want you to Adolin Go Adolin gritted his teeth but turned and stalked away It needed to be said he told himself as he left the gallery That didnt make him feel any less sick about having to be the one who said it SEVEN YEARS AGO It aint right what they do the womans voice said You aint supposed to cut into folks peering in to see what the Almighty placed hidden for good reason Kal froze standing in an alleyway between two houses in Hearthstone The sky was wan overhead winter had come for a time The Weeping was near and highstorms were infrequent For now it was too cold for plants to enjoy the respite rockbuds spent winter weeks curled up inside their shells Most creatures hibernated waiting for warmth to return Fortunately seasons generally lasted only a few weeks Unpredictability That was the way of the world Only after death was there stability So the ardents taught at least Kal wore a thick padded coat of breachtree cotton The material was scratchy but warm and had been dyed a deep brown He kept the hood up his hands in his pockets To his right sat the bakers placethe family slept in the triangular crawlspace in back and the front was their store To Kals left was one of Hearthstones taverns where lavis ale and mudbeer flowed in abundance during winter weeks He could hear two women unseen but chatting a short distance way You know that he stole from the old citylord one womans voice said keeping her voice down An entire goblet full of spheres The surgeon says they were a gift but he was the only one there when the citylord died There is a document I hear the first voice said A few glyphs Not a proper will And whose hand wrote those glyphs The surgeon himself It aint right the citylord not having a woman there to be scribe Im telling you It aint right what they do Kal gritted his teeth tempted to step out and let the women see that hed heard them His father wouldnt approve though Lirin wouldnt want to cause strife or embarrassment But that was his father So Kal marched right out of the alleyway passing Nanha Terith and Nanha Relina standing and gossiping in front of the bakery Terith was the bakers wife a fat woman with curly dark hair She was in the middle of another calumny Kal gave her a sharp look and her brown eyes showed a satisfying moment of discomfiture Kal crossed the square carefully wary of patches of ice The door to the bakery slammed shut behind him the two women fleeing inside His satisfaction didnt last long Why did people always say such things about his father They called him morbid and unnatural but would scurry out to buy glyphwards and charms from a passing apothecary or luckmerch The Almighty pity a man who actually did something useful to help Still stewing Kal turned a few corners walking to where his mother stood on a stepladder at the side of the town hall carefully chipping at the eaves of the building Hesina was a tall woman and she usually kept her hair pulled back into a tail then wrapped a kerchief around her head Today she wore a knit hat over that She had a long brown coat that matched Kals and the blue hem of her skirt just barely peeked out at the bottom The objects of her attention were a set of iciclelike pendants of rock that had formed on the edges of the roof Highstorms dropped stormwater and stormwater carried crem If left alone crem eventually hardened into stone Buildings grew stalactites formed by stormwater slowly dripping from the eaves You had to clean them off regularly or risk weighing down the roof so much that it collapsed She noticed him and smiled her cheeks flushed from the cold With a narrow face a bold chin and full lips she was a pretty woman At least Kal thought so Prettier than the bakers wife for sure Your father dismissed you from your lessons already she asked Everyone hates Father Kal blurted out His mother turned back to her work Kaladin youre thirteen Youre old enough to know not to say foolish things like that Its true he said stubbornly I heard some women talking just now They said that Father stole the spheres from Brightlord Wistiow They say that Father enjoys slicing people open and doing things that aint natural Arent natural Why cant I speak like everyone else Because it isnt proper Its proper enough for Nanha Terith And what do you think of her Kal hesitated Shes ignorant And she likes to gossip about things she doesnt know anything about Well then If you wish to emulate her I can obviously find no objection to the practice Kal grimaced You had to watch yourself when speaking with Hesina she liked to twist words about He leaned back against the wall of the town hall watching his breath puff out in front of him Perhaps a different tactic would work Mother why do people hate Father They dont hate him she said However his calmly asked question got her to continue But he does make them uncomfortable Why Because some people are frightened of knowledge Your father is a learned man he knows things the others cant understand So those things must be dark and mysterious They arent afraid of luckmerches and glyphwards Those you can understand his mother said calmly You burn a glyphward out in front of your house and it will turn away evil Its easy Your father wont give someone a ward to heal them Hell insist that they stay in bed drinking water taking some foul medicine and washing their wound each day Its hard Theyd rather leave it all to fate Kal considered that I think they hate him because he fails too often There is that If a glyphward fails you can blame it on the will of the Almighty If your father fails then its his fault Or such is the perception His mother continued working flakes of stone falling to the ground around her Theyll never actually hate your fatherhes too useful But hell never really be one of them Thats the price of being a surgeon Having power over the lives of men is an uncomfortable responsibility And if I dont want that responsibility What if I just want to be something normal like a baker or a farmer or Or a soldier he added in his mind Hed picked up a staff a few times in secret and though hed never been able to replicate that moment when hed fought Jost there was something invigorating about holding a weapon Something that drew him and excited him I think his mother said that youll find the lives of bakers and farmers are not so enviable At least they have friends And so do you What of Tien Tiens not my friend Mother Hes my brother Oh and he cant be both at once Kal rolled his eyes You know what I mean She climbed down from the stepladder patting his shoulder Yes I do and Im sorry to make light of it But you put yourself in a difficult position You want friends but do you really want to act like the other boys Give up your studies so you can slave in the fields Grow old before your time weathered and furrowed by the sun Kal didnt reply The things that others have always seem better than what you have his mother said Bring the stepladder Kal followed dutifully rounding the town hall to the other side then putting down the ladder so his mother could climb up to begin work again The others think Father stole those spheres Kal shoved his hands in his pockets They think he wrote out that order from Brightlord Wistiow and had the old man sign it when he didnt know what he was doing His mother was silent I hate their lies and gossip Kal said I hate them for making up things about us Dont hate them Kal Theyre good people In this case theyre just repeating what theyve heard She glanced at the citylords manor distant upon a hill above the town Every time Kal saw it he felt like he should go up and talk to Laral But the last few times hed tried he hadnt been allowed to see her Now that her father was dead her nurse oversaw her time and the woman didnt think mingling with boys from the town was appropriate The nurses husband Miliv had been Brightlord Wistiows head steward If there was a source of bad rumors about Kals family it probably came from him He never had liked Kals father Well Miliv wouldnt matter soon A new citylord was expected to arrive any day Mother Kal said those spheres are just sitting there doing nothing but glowing Cant we spend some to keep you from having to come out here and work I like working she said scraping away again It clears the head Didnt you just tell me that I wouldnt like having to labor My face furrowed before its time or something poetic like that She hesitated then laughed Clever boy Cold boy he grumbled shivering I work because I want to We cant spend those spherestheyre for your educationand so my working is better than forcing your father to charge for his healings Maybe theyd respect us more if we did charge Oh they respect us No I dont think that is the problem She looked down at Kal You know that were second nahn Sure Kal said shrugging An accomplished young surgeon of the right rank could draw the attention of a poorer noble family one who wished money and acclaim It happens in the larger cities Kal glanced up at the mansion again Thats why you encouraged me to play with Laral so much You wanted to marry me off to her didnt you It was a possibility his mother said returning to her work He honestly wasnt certain how he felt about that The last few months had been strange for Kal His father had forced him into his studies but in secret hed spent his time with the staff Two possible paths Both enticing Kal did like learning and he longed for the ability to help people bind their wounds make them better He saw true nobility in what his father did But it seemed to Kal that if he could fight he could do something even more noble Protect their lands like the great lighteyed heroes of the stories And there was the way he felt when holding a weapon Two paths Opposites in many ways He could only choose one His mother kept chipping away at the eaves andwith a sighKal fetched a second stepladder and set of tools from the workroom then joined her He was tall for his age but he still had to stand high on the ladder He caught his mother smiling as he worked no doubt pleased at having raised such a helpful young man In reality Kal just wanted the chance to pound on something How would he feel marrying someone like Laral Hed never be her equal Their children would have a chance of being lighteyed or darkeyed so even his children might outrank him He knew hed feel terribly out of place That was another aspect of becoming a surgeon If he chose that path he would be choosing the life of his father Choosing to set himself apart to be isolated If he went to war however he would have a place Maybe he could even do the nearly unthinkable win a Shardblade and become a true lighteyes Then he could marry Laral and not have to be her inferior Was that why shed always encouraged him to become a soldier Had she been thinking about these kinds of things even back then Back then these kinds of decisionsmarriage his futurehad seemed impossibly faroff to Kal He felt so young Did he really have to consider these questions It would still be another few years before the surgeons of Kharbranth would let him take their tests But if he were going to become a soldier instead hed have to join the army before that happened How would his father react if Kal just up and went with the recruiters Kal wasnt certain hed be able to face Lirins disappointed eyes As if in response to his thoughts Lirins voice called from nearby Hesina Kals mother turned smiling and tucking a stray lock of dark hair back into her kerchief Kals father rushed down the street his face anxious Kal felt a sudden jolt of worry Who was wounded Why hadnt Lirin sent for him What is it Kals mother asked climbing down Hes here Hesina Kals father said About time Who Kal asked jumping down from the stepladder Whos here The new citylord son Lirin said his breath puffing in the cold air His name is Brightlord Roshone No time to change Im afraid Not if we want to catch his first speech Come on The three of them hurried away Kals thoughts and worries banished in the face of the chance to meet a new lighteyes He didnt send word ahead Lirin said under his breath That could be a good sign Hesina replied Maybe he doesnt feel he needs everyone to dote on him That or hes inconsiderate Stormfather I hate getting a new Landed Always makes me feel like Im throwing a handful of stones into a game of breakneck Will we throw the queen or the tower We shall see soon enough Hesina said glancing at Kal Dont let your fathers words unnerve you He always gets pessimistic at times like this I do not Lirin said She gave him a look Name one other time Meeting my parents Kals father pulled up short blinking Stormwinds he muttered lets hope this doesnt go half as poorly as that Kal listened with curiosity Hed never met his mothers parents they werent often spoken of Soon the three of them reached the south side of town A crowd was gathered and Tien was already there waiting He waved in his excitable way jumping up and down Wish I had half that boys energy Lirin said Ive got a place for us picked out Tien called eagerly pointing By the rain barrels Come on Were going to miss it Tien scurried over climbing atop the barrels Several of the towns other boys noticed him and they nudged one another one making some comment Kal couldnt hear It set the others laughing at Tien and that immediately made Kal furious Tien didnt deserve mockery just because he was a little small for his age This wasnt a good time to confront the other boys though so Kal sullenly joined his parents beside the barrels Tien smiled at him standing atop his barrel Hed piled a few of his favorite rocks near him stones of different colors and shapes There were rocks all around them and yet Tien was the only person he knew who found wonder in them After a moments consideration Kal climbed atop a barrelcareful not to disturb any of Tiens rocksso he too could get a better view of the citylords procession It was enormous There must have been a dozen wagons in that line following a fine black carriage pulled by four sleek black horses Kal gawked despite himself Wistiow had only owned one horse and it had seemed as old as he was Could one man even a lighteyes own that much furniture Where would he put it all And there were people too Dozens of them riding in the wagons walking in groups There were also a dozen soldiers in gleaming breastplates and leather skirts This lighteyes even had his own honor guard Eventually the procession reached the turnoff to Hearthstone A man riding a horse led the carriage and its soldiers forward to the town while most of the wagons continued up to the manor Kal grew increasingly excited as the carriage rolled slowly into place Would he finally get to see a real lighteyed hero The word around town claimed it was likely that the new citylord would be someone King Gavilar or Highprince Sadeas had promoted because hed distinguished himself in the wars to unite Alethkar The carriage turned sideways so that the door faced the crowd The horses snorted and stomped the ground and the carriage driver hopped down and quickly opened the door A middleaged man with a short greystreaked beard stepped out He wore a ruffled violet coat tailored so that it was short at the frontreaching only to his waistbut long at the back Beneath it he wore a golden takama a long straight skirt that went down to his calves A takama Few wore them anymore but old soldiers in town spoke of the days when theyd been popular as warriors garb Kal hadnt expected the takama to look so much like a womans skirt but still it was a good sign Roshone himself seemed a little too old a little too flabby to be a true soldier But he wore a sword The lighteyed man scanned the crowd a distasteful look on his face as if hed swallowed something bitter Behind the man two people peeked out A younger man with a narrow face and an older woman with braided hair Roshone studied the crowd then shook his head and turned around to climb back in the carriage Kal frowned Wasnt he going to say anything The crowd seemed to share Kals shock a few of them began whispering in anxiety Brightlord Roshone Kals father called The crowd hushed The lighteyed man glanced back People shied away and Kal found himself shrinking down beneath that harsh gaze Who spoke Roshone demanded his voice a low baritone Lirin stepped forward raising a hand Brightlord Was your trip pleasant Please can we show you the town What is your name Lirin Brightlord Hearthstones surgeon Ah Roshone said Youre the one who let old Wistiow die The brightlords expression darkened In a way its your fault Im in this pitiful miserable quarter of the kingdom He grunted then climbed back in the carriage and slammed the door Within seconds the carriage driver had replaced the stairs climbed into his place and started turning the vehicle around Kals father slowly let his arm fall to his side The townspeople began to chatter immediately gossiping about the soldiers the carriage the horses Kal sat down on his barrel Well he thought I guess we could expect a warrior to be curt right The heroes from the legends werent necessarily the polite types Killing people and fancy talking didnt always go together old Jarel had once told him Lirin walked back his expression troubled Well Hesina said trying to sound cheerful What do you think Did we throw the queen or the tower Neither Oh And what did we throw instead Im not sure he said glancing over his shoulder A pair and a trio maybe Lets get back home Tien scratched his head in confusion but the words weighed on Kal The tower was three pairs in a game of breakneck The queen was two trios The first was an outright loss the other an outright win But a pair and a trio that was called the butcher Whether you won or not would depend on the other throws you made And more importantly on the throws of everyone else I am being chased Your friends of the Seventeenth Shard I suspect I believe theyre still lost following a false trail I left for them Theyll be happier that way I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me should they actually catch me I stood in the darkened monastery chamber Litima read standing at the lectern with the tome open before her its far reaches painted with pools of black where light did not wander I sat on the floor thinking of that dark that Unseen I could not know for certain what was hidden in that night I suspected there were walls sturdy and thick but could I know without seeing When all was hidden what could a man rely upon as True Litimaone of Dalinars scribeswas tall and plump and wore a violet silk gown with yellow trim She read to Dalinar as he stood regarding the maps on the wall of his sitting room That room was fitted with handsome wood furnishings and fine woven rugs imported up from Marat A crystal carafe of afternoon wineorange not intoxicatingsat on a highlegged serving table in the corner sparkling with the light of the diamond spheres hanging in chandeliers above Candle flames Litima continued The selection was from The Way of Kings read from the very copy that Gavilar had once owned A dozen candles burned themselves to death on the shelf before me Each of my breaths made them tremble To them I was a behemoth to frighten and destroy And yet if I strayed too close they could destroy me My invisible breath the pulses of life that flowed in and out could end them freely while my fingers could not do the same without being repaid in pain Dalinar idly twisted his signet ring in thought it was sapphire with his Kholin glyphpair on it Renarin stood next to him wearing a coat of blue and silver golden knots on the shoulders marking him as a prince Adolin wasnt there Dalinar and he had been stepping gingerly around one another since their argument in the Gallery I understood in a moment of stillness Litima read Those candle flames were like the lives of men So fragile So deadly Left alone they lit and warmed Let run rampant they would destroy the very things they were meant to illuminate Embryonic bonfires each bearing a seed of destruction so potent it could tumble cities and dash kings to their knees In later years my mind would return to that calm silent evening when I had stared at rows of living lights And I would understand To be given loyalty is to be infused like a gemstone to be granted the frightful license to destroy not only ones self but all within ones care Litima fell still It was the end of the sequence Thank you Brightness Litima Dalinar said That will do The woman bowed her head respectfully She gathered her youthful ward from the side of the room and they withdrew leaving the book on the lectern That sequence had become one of Dalinars favorites Listening to it often comforted him Someone else had known someone else had understood how he felt But today it didnt bring the solace it usually did It only reminded him of Adolins arguments None had been things Dalinar hadnt considered himself but being confronted with them by someone he trusted had shaken everything He found himself staring at his maps smaller copies of those that hung in the Gallery They had been recreated for him by the royal cartographer Isasik Shulin What if Dalinars visions really were just phantasms Hed often longed for the glory days of Alethkars past Were the visions his minds answer to that a subconscious way of letting himself be a hero of giving himself justification for doggedly seeking his goals A disturbing thought Looked at another way those phantom commands to unify sounded a great deal like what the Hierocracy had said when it had tried to conquer the world five centuries before Dalinar turned from his maps and walked across the room his booted feet falling on a soft rug Too nice a rug Hed spent the better part of his life in one warcamp or another hed slept in wagons stone barracks and tents pulled tight against the leeward side of stone formations Compared with that his present dwelling was practically a mansion He felt as if he should cast out all of this finery But what would that accomplish He stopped at the lectern and ran his fingers along the thick pages filled with lines in violet ink He couldnt read the words but he could almost feel them emanating from the page like Stormlight from a sphere Were the words of this book the cause of his problems The visions had started several months after hed first listened to readings from it He rested his hand on the cold inkfilled pages Their homeland was stressed nearly to breaking the war was stalled and suddenly he found himself captivated by the very ideals and myths that had led to his brothers downfall This was a time the Alethi needed the Blackthorn not an old tired soldier who fancied himself a philosopher Blast it all he thought I thought Id figured this out He closed the leatherbound volume the spine crackling He carried it to the bookshelf and returned it to its place Father Renarin asked Is there something I can do for you I wish there were son Dalinar tapped the spine of the book lightly Its ironic This book was once considered one of the great masterpieces of political philosophy Did you know that Jasnah told me that kings around the world used to study it daily Now it is considered borderline blasphemous Renarin gave no reply Regardless Dalinar said walking back to the wall map Highprince Aladar refused my offer of an alliance just as Roion did Do you have a thought on whom should I approach next Adolin says we should be far more worried about Sadeass ploy to destroy us than we are The room fell silent Renarin had a habit of doing that felling conversations like an enemy archer hunting officers on the battlefield Your brother is right to worry Dalinar said But moving against Sadeas would undermine Alethkar as a kingdom For the same reason Sadeas wont risk acting against us Hell see I hope Horns suddenly sounded outside their deep resounding calls echoing Dalinar and Renarin froze Parshendi spotted on the Plains A second set came Twentythird plateau of the second quadrant Dalinars scouts thought the contested plateau close enough for their forces to reach first Dalinar dashed across the room all other thoughts discarded for the moment his booted feet thumping on the thick rug He threw open the door and charged down the Stormlightilluminated hallway The war room door was open and Telebhighofficer on dutysaluted as Dalinar entered Teleb was a straightbacked man with light green eyes He kept his long hair in a braid and had a blue tattoo on his cheek marking him as an Oldblood At the side of the room his wife Kalami sat behind a longlegged desk on a high stool She wore her dark hair with only two small side braids pinned up the rest hanging down the back of her violet dress to brush the top of the stool She was a historian of note and had requested permission to record meetings like this one she planned to scribe a history of the war Sir Teleb said A chasmfiend crawled atop the plateau here less than a quarter hour ago He pointed to the battle map which had glyphs marking each plateau Dalinar stepped up to it a group of his officers gathering around him How far would you say that is Dalinar asked rubbing his chin Perhaps two hours Teleb said indicating a route one of his men had drawn on the map Sir I think we have a good chance at this one Brightlord Aladar will have to traverse six unclaimed plateaus to reach the contested area while we have a nearly direct line Brightlord Sadeas would have trouble as hed have to work his way around several large chasms too wide to cross with bridges Ill bet he wont even try for it Dalinar did indeed have the most direct line He hesitated though It had been months since hed last gone on a plateau run His attention had been diverted his troops needed for protecting roadways and patrolling the large markets that had grown up outside the warcamps And now Adolins questions weighed upon him pressing him down It seemed like a terrible time to go out to battle No he thought No I need to do this Winning a plateau skirmish would do much for his troops morale and would help discredit the rumors in camp We march Dalinar declared A few of the officers whooped in excitement an extreme show of emotion for the normally reserved Alethi And your son Brightlord Teleb asked Hed heard of the confrontation between them Dalinar doubted there was a person in all ten warcamps who hadnt heard of it Send for him Dalinar said firmly Adolin probably needed this as much as or more than Dalinar did The officers scattered Dalinars armor bearers entered a moment later It had only been a few minutes since the horns had sounded but after six years of fighting the machine of war ran smoothly when battle called From outside he heard the horns third set begin calling his forces to battle The armor bearers inspected his bootschecking to be certain the laces were tightthen brought a long padded vest to throw over his uniform Next they set the sabatonsarmor for his bootson the floor before him They encased his boots entirely and had a rough surface on the bottoms that seemed to cling to rock The interiors glowed with the light of the sapphires in their indented pockets Dalinar was reminded of his most recent vision The Radiant his armor glowing with glyphs Modern Shardplate didnt glow like that Could his mind have fabricated that detail Would it have No time to consider that now he thought He discarded his uncertainties and worries something hed learned to do during his first battles as a youth A warrior needed to be focused Adolins questions would still be waiting for him when he got back For now he couldnt afford selfdoubt or uncertainty It was time to be the Blackthorn He stepped into the sabatons and the straps tightened of their own accord fitting around his boots The greaves came next going over his legs and knees locking on to the sabatons Shardplate wasnt like ordinary armor there was no mesh of steel mail and no leather straps at the joints Shardplate seams were made of smaller plates interlocking overlapping incredibly intricate leaving no vulnerable gaps There was very little rubbing or chafing each piece fit together perfectly as if it had been crafted specifically for Dalinar One always put the armor on from the feet upward Shardplate was extremely heavy without the enhanced strength it provided no man would be able to fight in it Dalinar stood still as the armor bearers affixed the cuisses over his thighs and locked them to the culet and faulds across his waist and lower back A skirt made of small interlocking plates came next reaching down to just above the knees Brightlord Teleb said stepping up to him Have you given thought to my suggestion about the bridges You know how I feel about mancarried bridges Teleb Dalinar said as the armor bearers locked his breastplate into place then worked on the rerebraces and vambraces for his arms Already he could feel the strength of the Plate surging through him We wouldnt have to use the smaller bridges for the assault Teleb said Just for getting to the contested plateau Wed still have to bring the chullpulled bridges to get across that last chasm Dalinar said Im not convinced that bridge crews would move us any more quickly Not when we have to wait for those animals Teleb sighed Dalinar reconsidered A good officer was one who accepted orders and fulfilled them even when he disagreed But the mark of a great officer was that he also tried to innovate and offer appropriate suggestions You may recruit and train a single bridge crew Dalinar said We shall see In these races even a few minutes can be meaningful Teleb smiled Thank you sir Dalinar waved with his left hand as the armor bearers locked the gauntlet onto his right He made a fist tiny plates curving perfectly The left gauntlet followed Then the gorget went over his head covering his neck the pauldrons on his shoulders and the helm on his head Finally the armor bearers affixed his cape to the pauldrons Dalinar took a deep breath feeling the Thrill build for the approaching battle He strode from the war room footfalls firm and solid Attendants and servants scattered before him making way Wearing Shardplate again after a long period without was like waking up after a night of feeling groggy or disoriented The spring of the step the impetus the armor seemed to lend him made him want to race down the hallway and And why not He broke into a sprint Teleb and the others cried out in surprise rushing to keep up Dalinar outpaced them easily reaching the front gates of the complex and leaping through throwing himself off the long steps leading down from his enclave He exulted grinning as he hung in the air then slammed to the ground The force cracked the stone beneath him and he crouched into the impact Before him neat rows of barracks ran through his warcamp formed in radials with a meeting ground and mess hall at the center of each battalion His officers reached the top of the stairs looking down with amazement Renarin was with them wearing his uniform that had never seen battle his hand raised against the sunlight Dalinar felt foolish Was he a youth just given his first taste of Shardplate Back to work Stop playing Perethom his infantrylord saluted as Dalinar strode up Second and Third Battalions are on duty today Brightlord Forming ranks to march First Bridge Squad is gathered Brightlord Havarahthe bridgelordsaid striding up He was a short man with some Herdazian blood in him as evidenced by his dark crystalline fingernails though he didnt wear a sparkflicker I have word from Ashelem that the archery company is ready Cavalry Dalinar asked And where is my son Here Father called a familiar voice Adolinhis Shardplate painted a deep Kholin bluemade his way through the gathering crowd His visor was up and he looked eager though when he met Dalinars eyes he glanced away immediately Dalinar held up a hand quieting several officers who were trying to give him reports He strode to Adolin and the youth looked up meeting his gaze You said what you felt you must Dalinar said And Im not sorry I did Adolin replied But I am sorry for how and where I said it That wont happen again Dalinar nodded and that was enough Adolin seemed to relax a weight coming off his shoulders and Dalinar turned back to his officers In moments he and Adolin were leading a hurried group to the staging area As they did Dalinar did note Adolin waving to a young woman who stood beside the way wearing a red dress her hair up in a very nice braiding Is thater Malasha Adolin said Yes She looks nice Most of the time she is though shes somewhat annoyed that I wouldnt let her come with me today She wanted to come into battle Adolin shrugged Says shes curious Dalinar said nothing Battle was a masculine art A woman wanting to come to the battlefield was likewell like a man wanting to read Unnatural Ahead in the staging area the battalions were forming ranks and a squat lighteyed officer hurried up to Dalinar He had patches of red hair on his otherwise dark Alethi head and a long red mustache Ilamar the cavalrylord Brightlord he said my apologies for the delay Cavalry is mounted and ready We march then Dalinar said All ranks Brightlord a voice said Dalinar turned as one of his messengers approached The darkeyed man wore leathers marked with blue bands on the arms He saluted saying Highprince Sadeas has demanded admittance to the warcamp Dalinar glanced at Adolin His sons expression darkened He claims the kings writ of investigation grants him the right the messenger said Admit him Dalinar said Yes Brightlord the messenger said turning back One of the lesser officers Moratel went with him so that Sadeas could be welcomed and escorted by a lighteyes as befitted his station Moratel was least among those in attendance everyone understood he was the one Dalinar would send What do you think Sadeas wants this time Dalinar said quietly to Adolin Our blood Preferably warm perhaps sweetened with a shot of tallew brandy Dalinar grimaced and the two of them hurried past the ranks of soldiers The men had an air of anticipation spears held high darkeyed citizen officers standing at the sides with axes on their shoulders At the front of the force a group of chulls snorted and rummaged at the rocks by their feet harnessed to them were several enormous mobile bridges Gallant and Adolins white stallion Sureblood were waiting their reins held at the ready by grooms Ryshadium hardly needed handlers Once Gallant had kicked open his stall and made his way to the staging grounds on his own when a groom had been too slow Dalinar patted the midnight destrier on the neck then swung into the saddle He scanned the staging field then raised his arm to give the command to move However he noticed a group of mounted men riding up to the staging field led by a figure in dark red Shardplate Sadeas Dalinar stifled a sigh and gave the command to move out though he himself waited for the Highprince of Information Adolin came over on Sureblood and he gave Dalinar a glance that seemed to say Dont worry Ill behave As always Sadeas was a model of fashion his armor painted his helm ornamented with a completely different metallic pattern than he had worn last time This one was shaped like a stylized sunburst It looked almost like a crown Brightlord Sadeas Dalinar said This is an inconvenient time for your investigation Unfortunately Sadeas said reining in His Majesty is very eager to have answers and I can not stop my investigation even for a plateau assault I need to interview some of your soldiers Ill do it on the way out You want to come with us Why not I wont delay you He glanced at the chulls who lurched into motion pulling the bulky bridges I doubt that even were I to decide to crawl I could slow you any further Our soldiers need to concentrate on the upcoming battle Brightlord Adolin said They should not be distracted The kings will must be done Sadeas said shrugging not even bothering to look at Adolin Need I present the writ Surely you dont intend to forbid me Dalinar studied his former friend looking into those eyes trying to see into the mans soul Sadeas lacked his characteristic smirk he usually wore one of those when he was pleased with how a plot was going Did he realize that Dalinar knew how to read his expressions and so masked his emotions No need to present anything Sadeas My men are at your disposal If you have need of anything simply ask Adolin with me Dalinar turned Gallant and galloped down the line toward the front of the marching army Adolin followed reluctantly and Sadeas remained behind with his attendants The long ride began The permanent bridges here were Dalinars maintained and guarded by his soldiers and scouts connecting plateaus that he controlled Sadeas spent the trip riding near the middle of the column of two thousand He periodically sent an attendant to pull certain soldiers out of line Dalinar spent the ride mentally preparing himself for the battle ahead He spoke with his officers about the layout of the plateau got a report on where specifically the chasmfiend had chosen to make its chrysalis and sent scouts ahead to watch for Parshendi Those scouts carried their long poles to get them from plateau to plateau without bridges Dalinars force eventually reached the end of the permanent bridges and had to start waiting for the chull bridges to be lowered across the chasms The big machines were built like siege towers with enormous wheels and armored sections at the side where soldiers could push At a chasm they unhooked the chulls pushed the machine forward by hand and ratcheted a crank at the back to lower the bridge Once the bridge was set down the machinery was unlocked and pulled across The bridge was built so they could lock the machine onto the other side pull the bridge up then turn and hook the chulls up again It was a slow process Dalinar watched from horseback fingers tapping the side of his hogshide saddle as the first chasm was spanned Perhaps Teleb was right Could they use lighter more portable bridges to get across these early chasms then resort to the siege bridges only for the final assault A clatter of hooves on rock announced someone riding up the side of the column Dalinar turned expecting Adolin and instead found Sadeas Why had Sadeas asked to be Highprince of Information and why was he so dogged in pursuing this matter of the broken girth If he did decide to create some kind of false implication of Dalinars guilt The visions told me to trust him Dalinar told himself firmly But he was growing less certain about them How much dared he risk on what theyd said Your soldiers are quite loyal to you Sadeas noted as he arrived Loyalty is the first lesson of a soldiers life Dalinar said I would be worried if these men hadnt yet mastered it Sadeas sighed Really Dalinar Must you always be so sanctimonious Dalinar didnt reply Its odd how a leaders influence can affect his men Sadeas said So many of these are like smaller versions of you Bundles of emotion wrapped up and tied until they become stiff from the pressure Theyre so sure in some ways yet so insecure in others Dalinar kept his jaw clenched What is your game Sadeas Sadeas smiled leaning in speaking softly You want so badly to snap at me dont you Even in the old days you hated it when someone implied that you were insecure Back then your displeasure often ended with a head or two rolling across the stones I killed many who did not deserve death Dalinar said A man should not fear losing his head because he took one too many sips of wine Perhaps Sadeas said lightly But dont you ever want to let it out as you used to Doesnt it pound on you inside like someone trapped within a large drum Beating banging trying to claw free Yes Dalinar said The admission seemed to surprise Sadeas And the Thrill Dalinar Do you still feel the Thrill Men didnt often speak of the Thrill the joy and lust for battle It was a private thing I feel each of the things you mention Sadeas Dalinar said eyes forward But I dont always let them out A mans emotions are what define him and control is the hallmark of true strength To lack feeling is to be dead but to act on every feeling is to be a child That has the stink of a quote about it Dalinar From Gavilars little book of virtues I assume Yes Doesnt it bother you at all that the Radiants betrayed us Legends The Recreance is an event so old it might as well be in the shadowdays What did the Radiants really do Why did they do it We dont know We know enough They used elaborate tricks to imitate great powers and pretend a holy calling When their deceptions were discovered they fled Their powers were not lies They were real Oh Sadeas said amused You know this Didnt you just say the event was so old it might as well have been in the shadowdays If the Radiants had such marvelous powers why can nobody reproduce them Where did those incredible skills go I dont know Dalinar said softly Perhaps were just not worthy of them any longer Sadeas snorted and Dalinar wished hed bitten his tongue His only evidence for what he said was his visions And yet if Sadeas belittled something he instinctively wanted to stand up for it I cant afford this I need to be focused on the battle ahead Sadeas he said determined to change the topic We need to work harder to unify the warcamps I want your help now that youre Highprince of Information To do what To do what needs to be done For the good of Alethkar Thats exactly what Im doing old friend Sadeas said Killing Parshendi Winning glory and wealth for our kingdom Seeking vengeance It would be best for Alethkar if youd stop wasting so much time in campand stop talking of fleeing like cowards It would be best for Alethkar if youd start acting like a man again Enough Sadeas Dalinar said more loudly than hed intended I gave you leave to come along for your investigation not to taunt me Sadeas sniffed That book ruined Gavilar Now its doing the same to you Youve listened to those stories so much theyve got your head full of false ideals Nobody ever really lived the way the Codes claim Bah Dalinar said waving a hand and turning Gallant I dont have time for your snideness today Sadeas He trotted his horse away furious at Sadeas then even more furious at himself for losing his temper He crossed the bridge stewing thinking of Sadeass words He found himself remembering a day when he stood with his brother beside the Impossible Falls of Kholinar Things are different now Dalinar Gavilar had said I see now in ways I never did before I wish I could show you what I mean It had been three days before his death Ten heartbeats Dalinar closed his eyes breathing in and outslowly calminglyas they prepared themselves behind the siege bridge Forget Sadeas Forget the visions Forget his worries and fears Just focus on the heartbeats Nearby chulls scraped the rock with their hard carapaced feet The wind blew across his face smelling wet It always smelled wet out here in these humid stormlands Soldiers clanked leather creaked Dalinar raised his head toward the sky his heart thumping deep within him The brilliant white sun stained his eyelids red Men shifted called cursed loosened swords in their sheaths tested bowstrings He could feel their tension their anxiety mixed with excitement Among them anticipationspren began to spring from the ground streamers connected by one side to the stone the others whipping in the air Some fearspren boiled up among them Are you ready Dalinar asked softly The Thrill was rising within him Yes Adolins voice was eager You never complain about the way we attack Dalinar said eyes still closed You never challenge me on this This is the best way Theyre my men too What is the point of being a Shardbearer if we can not lead the charge The tenth heartbeat sounded in Dalinars chest he could always hear the beats when he was summoning his Blade no matter how loud the world around him was The faster they passed the sooner the blade arrived So the more urgent you felt the sooner you were armed Was that intentional or just some quirk of the Shardblades nature Oathbringers familiar weight settled into his hand Go Dalinar said snapping his eyes open He slammed his visor down as Adolin did the same Stormlight rising from the sides as the helms sealed shut and became translucent The two of them burst out from behind the massive bridgeone Shardbearer on each side a figure of blue and another of slate grey The energy of the armor pulsed through Dalinar as he dashed across the stone ground arms pumping in rhythm with his steps The wave of arrows came immediately loosed from the Parshendi kneeling on the other side of the chasm Dalinar flung his arm up in front of his eye slit as arrows sprayed across him scraping metal some shafts snapping It felt like running against a hailstorm Adolin bellowed a war cry from the right voice muffled by his helm As they approached the chasm lip Dalinar lowered his arm despite the arrows He needed to be able to judge his approach The gulf was mere feet away His Plate gave him a surge of strength as he reached the edge of the chasm Then leaped For a moment he soared above the inky chasm cape flapping arrows filling the air around him He was reminded of the flying Radiant from his vision But this was nothing so mystical just a standard Shardplateassisted jump Dalinar cleared the chasm and crashed back to the ground on the other side sweeping his Blade down and across to slay three Parshendi with a single blow Their eyes burned black and smoke rose as they collapsed He swung again Bits of armor and weapons sprayed into the air where arrows had once flown sheared free by his Blade As always it sliced apart anything inanimate but blurred when it touched flesh as if turning to mist The way it reacted to flesh and cut steel so easily it sometimes felt to Dalinar like he was swinging a weapon of pure smoke As long as he kept the Blade in motion it could not get caught in chinks or stopped by the weight of what it was cutting Dalinar spun sweeping out with his Blade in a line of death He sheared through souls themselves leaving Parshendi to drop dead to the ground Then he kicked tossing a corpse into the faces of the Parshendi nearby A few more kicks sent corpses flyinga Platedriven kick could easily send a body tumbling thirty feetclearing the ground around him for better footing Adolin hit the plateau not far away spinning and falling into Windstance Adolin shoved his shoulder into a group of archers tossing them backward and throwing several into the chasm Gripping his Shardblade with both hands he did an initial sweep as Dalinar had cutting down six enemies The Parshendi were singing many of them wearing beards that glowed with small uncut gemstones Parshendi always sang as they fought that song changed as they abandoned their bowspulling out axes swords or macesand threw themselves at the two Shardbearers Dalinar put himself at the optimal distance from Adolin allowing his son to protect his blind spots but not getting too close The two Shardbearers fought still near the lip of the chasm cutting down the Parshendi who tried desperately to push them backward by sheer force of numbers This was their best chance to defeat the Shardbearers Dalinar and Adolin were alone without their honor guard A fall from this height would certainly kill even a man in Plate The Thrill rose within him so sweet Dalinar kicked away another corpse though he didnt need the extra room Theyd noticed that the Parshendi grew enraged when you moved their dead He kicked another body taunting them drawing them toward him to fight in pairs as they often did He cut down a group that came singing in voices angry at what hed done to their dead Nearby Adolin began to lay about him with punches as the Parshendi got too close he was fond of the tactic switching between using his sword in two hands or one Parshendi corpses flew this way and that bones and armor shattered by the blows orange Parshendi blood spraying across the ground Adolin moved back to his Blade a moment later kicking away a corpse The Thrill consumed Dalinar giving him strength focus and power The glory of the battle grew grand Hed stayed away from this too long He saw with clarity now They did need to push harder assault more plateaus win the gemhearts Dalinar was the Blackthorn He was a natural force never to be halted He was death itself He He felt a sudden stab of powerful revulsion a sickness so strong that it made him gasp He slipped partially on a patch of blood but partially because his knees grew suddenly weak The corpses before him suddenly seemed a horrifying sight Eyes burned out like spent coals Bodies limp and broken bones shattered where Adolin had punched them Heads cracked open blood and brains and entrails spilled around them Such butchery such death The Thrill vanished How could a man enjoy this The Parshendi surged toward him Adolin was there in a heartbeat attacking with more skill than any other man Dalinar had known The lad was a genius with the Blade an artist with paint of only one shade He struck expertly forcing the Parshendi back Dalinar shook his head recovering his stance He forced himself to resume fighting and as the Thrill began to rise again Dalinar hesitantly embraced it The odd sickness faded and his battle reflexes took control He spun into the Parshendi advance sweeping out with his Blade in broad aggressive strokes He needed this victory For himself for Adolin and for his men Why had he been so horrified The Parshendi had murdered Gavilar It was right to kill them He was a soldier Fighting was what he did And he did it well The Parshendi advance unit broke before his assault scattering back toward a larger mass of their troops who were forming ranks in haste Dalinar stepped back and found himself looking down at the corpses around him with their blackened eyes Smoke still curled from a few The sick feeling returned Life ended so quickly The Shardbearer was destruction incarnate the most powerful force on a battlefield Once these weapons meant protecting a voice inside of him whispered The three bridges crashed to the ground a few feet away and the cavalry charged across a moment later led by compact Ilamar A few windspren danced past in the air nearly invisible Adolin called for his horse but Dalinar just stood looking down at the dead Parshendi blood was orange and it smelled like mold Yet their facesmarbled black or white and redlooked so human A parshman nurse had practically raised Dalinar Life before death What was that voice He glanced back across the chasm toward where Sadeaswell outside of bow rangesat with his attendants Dalinar could sense the disapproval in his exfriends posture Dalinar and Adolin risked themselves taking a dangerous leap across the chasm An assault of the type Sadeas had pioneered would cost more lives But how many lives would Dalinars army lose if one of its Shardbearers was pushed into the chasm Gallant charged across the bridge alongside a line of soldiers who cheered for the Ryshadium He slowed near Dalinar who grabbed the reins Right now he was needed His men were fighting and dying and this was not a time for regret or secondguessing A Plateenhanced jump put him in the saddle Then Shardblade raised high he charged into battle to kill for his men That was not what the Radiants had fought for But at least it was something They won the battle Dalinar stepped back feeling fatigued as Adolin did the honors of harvesting the gemheart The chrysalis itself sat like an enormous oblong rockbud fifteen feet tall and attached to the uneven stone ground by something that looked like crem There were bodies all around it some human others Parshendi The Parshendi had tried to get into it quickly and flee but theyd only managed to get a few cracks into the shell The fighting had been most furious here around the chrysalis Dalinar rested back against a shelf of rock and pulled his helm off exposing a sweaty head to the cool breeze The sun was high overhead the battle had lasted two hours or so Adolin worked efficiently using his Shardblade with care to shave off a section of the outside of the chrysalis Then he expertly plunged it in killing the pupating creature but avoiding the region with the gemheart Just like that the creature was dead Now the Shardblade could cut it and Adolin carved away sections of flesh Purple ichor spurted out as he reached in questing for the gemheart The soldiers cheered as he pulled it free gloryspren hovering above the entire army like hundreds of spheres of light Dalinar found himself walking away helm held in his left hand He crossed the battlefield passing surgeons tending the wounded and teams who were carrying his dead back to the bridges There were sleds behind the chull carts for them so they could be burned properly back at camp There were a lot of Parshendi corpses Looking at them now he was neither disgusted nor excited Just exhausted Hed gone to battle dozens perhaps hundreds of times Never before had he felt as he had this day That revulsion had distracted him and that could have gotten him killed Battle was no time for reflection you had to keep your mind on what you were doing The Thrill had seemed subdued the entire battle and he hadnt fought nearly as well as he once had This battle should have brought him clarity Instead his troubles seemed magnified Blood of my fathers he thought stepping up to the top of a small rock hill What is happening to me His weakness today seemed the latest and most potent argument to fuel what Adolinand indeed what many otherssaid about him He stood atop the hill looking eastward toward the Origin His eyes went that direction so often Why What was He froze noticing a group of Parshendi on a nearby plateau His scouts watched them warily it was the army that Dalinars people had driven off Though theyd killed a lot of Parshendi today the vast majority had still escaped retreating when they realized the battle was lost to them That was one of the reasons the war was lasting so long The Parshendi understood strategic retreat This army stood in ranks grouped in warpairs A commanding figure stood at their head a large Parshendi in glittering armor Shardplate Even at a distance it was easy to tell the difference between it and something more mundane That Shardbearer hadnt been here during the battle itself Why come now Had he arrived too late The armored figure and the rest of the Parshendi turned and left leaping across the chasm behind them and fleeing back toward their unseen haven at the center of the Plains If anything I have said makes a glimmer of sense to you I trust that youll call them off Or maybe you could astound me and ask them to do something productive for once Kaladin pushed his way into the apothecarys shop the door banging shut behind him As before the aged man pretended to be feeble feeling his way with a cane until he recognized Kaladin Then he stood up straighter Oh Its you It had been two more long days Daytime spent working and trainingTeft and Rock now practiced with himevenings spent at the first chasm retrieving the reeds from their hiding place in a crevice and then milking for hours Gaz had seen them go down last night and the bridge sergeant was undoubtedly suspicious There was no helping that Bridge Four had been called out on a bridge run today Thankfully theyd arrived before the Parshendi and none of the bridge crews had lost any men Things hadnt gone so well for the regular Alethi troops The Alethi line had eventually buckled before the Parshendi assault and the bridge crews had been forced to lead a tired angry and defeated troop of soldiers back to the camp Kaladin was blearyeyed with fatigue from staying up late working on the reeds His stomach growled perpetually from being given a fraction of the food it needed as he shared his meals with two wounded That all ended today The apothecary walked back behind his counter and Kaladin stepped up to it Syl darted into the room her small ribbon of light turning into a woman midtwist She flipped like an acrobat landing on the table in a smooth motion What do you need the apothecary asked More bandages Well I might just He cut off as Kaladin slapped a mediumsized liquor bottle down on the table It had a cracked top but would still hold a cork He pulled this free revealing the milky white knobweed sap inside Hed used the first of what theyd harvested to treat Leyten Dabbid and Hobber Whats this the elderly apothecary asked adjusting his spectacles and leaning down Offering me a drink I dont take the stuff these days Unsettles the stomach you know Its not liquor Its knobweed sap You said it was expensive Well how much will you give me for this The apothecary blinked then leaned in closer giving the contents a whiff Whered you get this I harvested it from the reeds growing outside of camp The apothecarys expression darkened He shrugged Worthless Im afraid What The wild weeds arent potent enough The apothecary replaced the cork A strong wind buffeted the building blowing under the door stirring the scents of the many powders and tonics he sold This is practically useless Ill give you two clearmarks for it which is being generous Ill have to distill it and will be lucky to get a couple of spoonfuls Two marks Kaladin thought with despair After three days of work three of us pushing ourselves getting only a few hours of sleep each night All for something worth only a couple days wage But no The sap had worked on Leytens wound making the rotspren flee and the infection retreat Kaladin narrowed his eyes as the apothecary fished two marks out of his money pouch setting them on the table Like many spheres these were flattened slightly on one side to keep them from rolling away Actually the apothecary said rubbing his chin Ill give you three He took out one more mark Hate to see all of your effort go to waste Kaladin Syl said studying the apothecary Hes nervous about something I think hes lying I know Kaladin said Whats that the apothecary said Well if you knew it was worthless why did you spend so much effort on it He reached for the bottle Kaladin caught his hand We got two or more drops from each reed you know The apothecary frowned Last time Kaladin said you told me Id be lucky to get one drop per reed You said that was why knobweed sap was so expensive You said nothing about wild plants being weaker Well I didnt think youd go and try gathering them and He trailed off as Kaladin locked eyes with him The army doesnt know do they Kaladin asked They arent aware how valuable those plants outside are You harvest them you sell the sap and you make a killing since the military needs a lot of antiseptic The old apothecary cursed pulling his hand back I dont know what youre talking about Kaladin took his jar And if I go to the healing tent and tell them where I got this Theyd take it from you the man said urgently Dont be a fool Youve a slave brand boy Theyll think you stole it Kaladin moved to walk away Ill give a skymark the apothecary said Thats half what Id charge the military for this much Kaladin turned You charge them two skymarks for something that only takes a couple of days to gather Its not just me the apothecary said scowling Each of the apothecaries charges the same We got together decided on a fair price How is that a fair price We have to make a living here in this Almightyforsaken land It costs us money to set up shop to maintain ourselves to hire guards He fished in his pouch pulling out a sphere that glowed deep blue A sapphire sphere was worth about twentyfive times a diamond one As Kaladin made one diamond mark a day a skymark was worth as much as Kaladin made in half a month Of course a common darkeyed soldier earned five clearmarks a day which would make this a weeks wages to them Once this wouldnt have seemed like much money to Kaladin Now it was a fortune Still he hesitated I should expose you Men die because of you No they dont the apothecary said The highprinces have more than enough to pay this considering what they make on the plateaus We supply them with bottles of sap as often as they need them All youd do by exposing us is let monsters like Sadeas keep a few more spheres in their pockets The apothecary was sweating Kaladin was threatening to topple his entire business on the Shattered Plains And so much money was being earned on the sap that this could grow very dangerous Men killed to keep such secrets Line my pocket or line the brightlords Kaladin said I guess I cant argue with that logic He set the bottle back on the counter Ill take the deal provided you throw in some more bandages Very well the apothecary said relaxing But stay away from those reeds Im surprised you found any nearby that hadnt already been harvested My workers are having an increasingly difficult time They dont have a windspren guiding them Kaladin thought Then why would you want to discourage me I could get more of this for you Well yes the apothecary said But Its cheaper if you do it yourself Kaladin said leaning down But this way you have a clean trail I provide the sap charging one skymark If the lighteyes ever discover what the apothecaries have been doing you can claim ignoranceall you know is that some bridgeman was selling you sap and you resold it to the army at a reasonable markup That seemed to appeal to the old man Well perhaps I wont ask too many questions about how you harvested this Your business young man Your business indeed He shuffled to the back of his store returning with a box of bandages Kaladin accepted it and left the shop without a word Arent you worried Syl said floating up beside his head as he entered the afternoon sunlight If Gaz discovers what youre doing you could get into trouble What more could they do to me Kaladin asked I doubt theyd consider this a crime worth stringing me up for Syl looked backward forming into little more than a cloud with the faint suggestion of a female form I cant decide if its dishonest or not Its not dishonest its business He grimaced Lavis grain is sold the same way Grown by the farmers and sold at a pittance to merchants who carry it to the cities and sell it to other merchants who sell it to people for four or five times what it was originally bought for So why did it bother you Syl asked frowning as they avoided a troop of soldiers one of whom tossed the pit of a palafruit at Kaladins head The soldiers laughed Kaladin rubbed his temple Ive still got some strange scruples about charging for medical care because of my father He sounds like hes a very generous man For all the good it did him Of course in a way Kaladin was just as bad During his early days as a slave hed have done almost anything for a chance to walk around unsupervised like this The army perimeter was guarded but if he could sneak the knobweed in he could probably find a way to sneak himself out With that sapphire mark he even had money to aid him Yes he had the slave brand but some quick if painful work with a knife could turn that into a battle scar instead He could talk and fight like a soldier so it would be plausible Hed be taken for a deserter but he could live with that That had been his plan for most of the later months of his enslavement but hed never had the means It took money to travel to get far enough away from the area where his description would be in circulation Money to buy lodging in a seedy section of town a place where nobody asked questions while he healed from his selfinflicted wound In addition there had always been the others So hed stayed trying to get as many out as he could Failing every time And he was doing it again Kaladin Syl asked from his shoulder You look very serious What are you thinking Im wondering if I should run Escape this stormcursed camp and find myself a new life Syl fell silent Life is hard here she finally said I dont know if anyone would blame you Rock would he thought And Teft Theyd worked for that knobweed sap They didnt know what it was worth they thought it was only for healing the sick If he ran hed be betraying them Hed be abandoning the bridgemen Shove over you fool Kaladin thought to himself You wont save these bridgemen Just like you didnt save Tien You should run And then what he whispered Syl turned to him What If he ran what good would it do A life working for chips in the underbelly of some rotting city No He couldnt leave them Just like hed never been able to leave anyone who hed thought needed him He had to protect them He had to For Tien And for his own sanity Chasm duty Gaz said spitting to the side The spittle was colored black from the yamma plant he chewed What Kaladin had returned from selling the knobweed to discover that Gaz had changed Bridge Fours work detail They werent scheduled to be on duty for any bridge runstheir run the day before exempted them Instead they were supposed to be assigned to Sadeass smithy to help lift ingots and other supplies That sounded like difficult work but it was actually among the easiest jobs bridgemen got The blacksmiths felt they didnt need the extra hands That or they presumed that clumsy bridgemen would just get in the way On smithy duty you usually only worked a few hours of the shift and could spend the rest lounging Gaz stood with Kaladin in the early afternoon sunlight You see Gaz said you got me thinking the other day Nobody cares if Bridge Four is given unfair work details Everyone hates chasm duty I figured you wouldnt care How much did they pay you Kaladin asked stepping forward Storm off Gaz said spitting again The others resent you Itll do your crew good to be seen paying for what you did Surviving Gaz shrugged Everyone knows you broke the rules in bringing back those men If the others do what you did wed have each barrack filled with the dying before the leeward side of a month was over Theyre people Gaz If we dont fill the barracks with wounded its because were leaving them out there to die Theyll die here anyway Well see Gaz watched him eyes narrow It seemed like he suspected that Kaladin had somehow tricked him in taking the stonegathering duty Earlier Gaz had apparently gone down to the chasm probably trying to figure out what Kaladin and the other two had been doing Damnation Kaladin thought Hed thought he had Gaz cowed enough to stay in line Well go Kaladin snapped turning away But Im not taking the blame among my men for this one Theyll know you did it Fine Gaz called after him Then to himself he continued Maybe Ill get lucky and a chasmfiend will eat the lot of you Chasm duty Most bridgemen would rather spend all day hauling stones than get assigned to the chasms With an unlit oilsoaked torch tied to his back Kaladin climbed down the precarious rope ladder The chasm was shallow here only about fifty feet down but that was enough to take him into a different world A world where the only natural light came from the rift high in the sky A world that stayed damp on even the hottest days a drowned landscape of moss fungus and hardy plants that survived in even dim light The chasms were wider at the bottom perhaps a result of highstorms They caused enormous floods to crash through the chasms to be caught in a chasm during a highstorm was death A sediment of hardened crem smoothed the pathway on the floor of the chasms though it rose and fell with the varying erosion of the underlying rock In some few places the distance from the chasm floor to the edge of the plateau above was only about forty feet In most places however it was closer to a hundred or more Kaladin jumped off the ladder falling a few feet and landing with a splash in a puddle of rainwater After lighting the torch he held it high peering along the caliginous rift The sides were slick with a dark green moss and several thin vines he didnt recognize trailed down from intermediate ledges above Bits of bone wood and torn cloth lay strewn about or wedged into clefts Someone splashed to the ground beside him Teft cursed looking down at his soaked legs and trousers as he stepped out of the large puddle Storms take that cremling Gaz the aging bridgeman muttered Sending us down here when it isnt our turn Ill have his beans for this I am certain that he is very scared of you Rock said stepping down off the ladder onto a dry spot Is probably back in camp crying in fear Storm off Teft said shaking the water from his left leg The two of them carried unlit torches Kaladin lit his with a flint and steel but the others did not They needed to ration the torches The other men of Bridge Four began to gather near the bottom of the ladder staying in a clump Every fourth man lit his torch but the light didnt do much to dispel the gloom it just allowed Kaladin to see more of the unnatural landscape Strange tubeshaped fungi grew in cracks They were a wan yellow like the skin of a child with jaundice Scuttling cremlings moved away from the light The tiny crustaceans were a translucent reddish color as one scrambled past on the wall he realized that he could see its internal organs through its shell The light also revealed a twisted broken figure at the base of the chasm wall a short distance away Kaladin raised his torch and stepped up to it It was beginning to stink already He raised a hand unconsciously covering his nose and mouth as he knelt down It was a bridgeman or had been from one of the other crews He was fresh If hed been here longer than a few days the highstorm would have washed him away to some distant place Bridge Four gathered behind Kaladin looking silently at the one who had chosen to throw himself into the chasm May you someday find a place of honor in the Tranquiline Halls fallen brother Kaladin said his voice echoing And may we find a better end than you He stood holding his torch high and led the way past the dead sentry His crew followed nervously Kaladin had quickly understood the basic tactics of fighting on the Shattered Plains You wanted to advance forcefully pressing your enemy to the plateaus edge That was why the battles often turned bloody for the Alethi who usually arrived after the Parshendi The Alethi had bridges while these odd Eastern parshmen could leap most chasms given a running start But both had trouble when squeezed toward the cliffs and that generally resulted in soldiers losing their footing and tumbling into the void The numbers were significant enough for the Alethi to want to recover lost equipment And so bridgemen were sent on chasm duty It was like barrow robbing only without the barrows They carried sacks and would spend hours walking around looking for the corpses of the fallen searching for anything of value Spheres breastplates caps weapons Some days when a plateau run was recent they could try to make their way all the way out to where it had happened and scavenge from those bodies But highstorms generally made that futile Wait even a few days and the bodies would be washed someplace else Beyond that the chasms were a bewildering maze and getting to a specific contested plateau and then returning in a reasonable time was near impossible General wisdom was to wait for a highstorm to push the bodies toward the Alethi side of the Plainshighstorms always came east to west after alland then send bridgemen down to search them out That meant a lot of random wandering But over the years enough bodies had fallen that it wasnt too difficult to find places to harvest The crew was required to bring up a specific amount of salvage or face docked pay for the week but the quota wasnt onerous Enough to keep the bridgemen working but not enough to force them to fully exert themselves Like most bridgeman work this was meant to keep them occupied as much as anything else As they walked down the first chasm some of his men got out their sacks and picked up pieces of salvage they passed A helmet here a shield there They kept a keen watch for spheres Finding a valuable fallen sphere would result in a small reward for the whole crew They werent allowed to bring their own spheres or possessions into the chasm of course And on their way out they were searched thoroughly The humiliation of that searchwhich included any place a sphere might be hiddenwas part of the reason chasm duty was so loathed But only a part As they walked the chasm floor widened to about fifteen feet Here marks scarred the walls gashes where the moss had been scraped away the stone itself scored The bridgemen tried not to look at those marks Occasionally chasmfiends stalked these pathways searching for either carrion or a suitable plateau to pupate upon Encountering one of them was uncommon but possible Kelek but I hate this place Teft said walking beside Kaladin I heard that once an entire bridge crew got eaten by a chasmfiend one at a time after it backed them into a dead end It just sat there picking them off as they tried to run past Rock chuckled If they were all eaten then who was returning to tell this story Teft rubbed his chin I dunno Maybe they just never returned Then perhaps they fled Deserting No Teft said You cant get out of these chasms without a ladder He glanced upward toward the narrow rift of blue seventy feet above following the curve of the plateau Kaladin glanced up as well That blue sky seemed so distant Unreachable Like the light of the Halls themselves And even if you could climb out at one of the shallower areas youd either be trapped on the Plains without a way to cross chasms or youd be close enough to the Alethi side that the scouts would spot you crossing the permanent bridges You could try going eastward toward where the plateaus were worn away to the point that they were just spires But that would take weeks of walking and would require surviving multiple highstorms You ever been in a slot canyon when rains come Rock Teft asked perhaps thinking along the same lines No Rock replied On the Peaks we have not these things They only exist where foolish men choose to live You live here Rock Kaladin noted And I am foolish the large Horneater said chuckling Did you not notice this thing These last two days had changed him a great deal He was more affable returning in some measure to what Kaladin assumed was his normal personality I was talking Teft said about slot canyons You want to guess what will happen if we get trapped down here in a highstorm Lots of water I guess Rock said Lots of water looking to go any place it can Teft said It gathers into enormous waves and goes crashing through these confined spaces with enough force to toss boulders In fact an ordinary rain will feel like a highstorm down here A highstormwell this would probably be the worst place in Roshar to be when one hits Rock frowned at that glancing upward Best not to be caught in the storm then Yeah Teft said Though Teft Rock added it would give you bath which you very much need Hey Teft grumbled Is that a comment on how I smell No Rock said Is comment on what I have to smell Sometimes I am thinking that a Parshendi arrow in the eye would be better than smelling entire bridge crew enclosed in barrack at night Teft chuckled Id take offense at that if it werent true He sniffed at the damp moldy chasm air This place aint much better It smells worse than a Horneaters boots in winter down here He hesitated Er no offense I mean personally Kaladin smiled then glanced back The thirty or so other bridgemen followed like ghosts A few seemed to be edging close to Kaladins group as if trying to listen in without being obvious Teft Kaladin said Smells worse than a Horneaters boots How in the Halls isnt he supposed to take offense at that phrase Its just an expression Teft said scowling It was out of my mouth before I realized what I was saying Alas Rock said pulling a tuft of moss off the wall inspecting it as they walked Your insult has offended me If we were at the Peaks we would have to duel in the traditional aliltikii fashion Which is what Teft asked With spears Rock laughed No no We upon the Peaks are not barbarians like you down here How then Kaladin asked genuinely curious Well Rock said dropping the moss and dusting off his hands is involving much mudbeer and singing Hows that a duel He who can still sing after the most drinks is winner Plus soon everyone is so drunk that they probably forget what argument was about Teft laughed Beats knives at dawn I suppose I guess that depends Kaladin said Upon what Teft asked On whether or not youre a knife merchant Eh Dunny The other two glanced to the side where Dunny had moved up close to listen The spindly youth jumped and blushed ErI Rock chuckled at Kaladins words Dunny he said to the youth Is odd name What is meaning of it Meaning Dunny asked I dont know Names dont always have a meaning Rock shook his head displeased Lowlanders How are you to know who you are if your name has no meaning So your name means something Teft asked Numanu Numuhukumakiakiaialunamor Rock said the native Horneater sounds flowing easily from his lips Of course Is description of very special rock my father discovered the day before my birth So your name is a whole sentence Dunny asked uncertainas if he wasnt sure he belonged Is poem Rock said On the Peaks everyones name is poem Is that so Teft said scratching at his beard Must make calling the family at mealtime a bit of a chore Rock laughed True true Is also making for some interesting arguments Usually the best insults on the Peaks are in the form of a poem one which is similar in composition and rhyme to the persons name Kelek Teft muttered Sounds like a lot of work Is why most arguments end in drinking perhaps Rock said Dunny smiled hesitantly Hey you big buffoon you smell like a wet hog so go out by the moon and jump yourself in the bog Rock laughed riotously his booming voice echoing down the chasm Is good is good he said wiping his eyes Simple but good That almost had the sound of a song to it Dunny Kaladin said Well it was the first thing that came to mind I put it to the tune of Maris Two Lovers to get the beat right You can sing Rock asked I must be hearing But Dunny said Sing Rock commanded pointing Dunny yelped but obeyed breaking into a song that wasnt familiar to Kaladin It was an amusing tale involving a woman and twin brothers who she thought were the same person Dunnys voice was a pure tenor and he seemed to have more confidence when he sang than when he spoke He was good Once he moved to the second verse Rock began humming in a deep voice providing a harmony The Horneater was obviously very practiced at song Kaladin glanced back at the other bridgemen hoping to pull some more into the conversation or the song He smiled at Skar but got only a scowl in return Moash and Sigzilthe darkskinned Azish manwouldnt even look at him Peet looked only at his feet When the song was finished Teft clapped appreciatively Thats a better performance than Ive heard at many an inn Is good to meet a lowlander who can sing Rock said stooping down to pick up a helm and stuff it in his bag This particular chasm didnt seem to have much in the way of salvage this time I had begun thinking you were all as tone deaf as my fathers old axehound Ha Dunny blushed but seemed to walk more confidently They continued occasionally passing turns or rifts in the stone where the waters had deposited large clusters of salvage Here the work turned more gruesome and theyd often have to pull out corpses or piles of bones to get what they wanted gagging at the scent Kaladin told them to leave the more sickening or rotted bodies for now Rotspren tended to cluster around the dead If they didnt find enough salvage later they could get those on the way back At every intersection or branch Kaladin made a white mark on the wall with a piece of chalk That was the bridgeleaders duty and he took it seriously He wouldnt have his crew getting lost out in these rifts As they walked and worked Kaladin kept the conversation going He laughedforced himself to laughwith them If that laugher felt hollow to him the others didnt seem to notice Perhaps they felt as he did that even forced laughter was preferable to going back to the selfabsorbed mournful silence that cloaked most bridgemen Before long Dunny was laughing and talking with Teft and Rock his shyness faded A few others hovered just behindYake Maps a couple of otherslike wild creatures drawn to the light and warmth of a fire Kaladin tried to draw them into the conversation but it didnt work so eventually he just let them be Eventually they reached a place with a significant number of fresh corpses Kaladin wasnt sure what combination of waterflow had made this section of chasm a good place for thatit looked the same as other stretches A little narrower perhaps Sometimes they could go to the same nooks and find good salvage there other times those were empty but other places would have dozens of corpses These bodies looked like theyd floated in the wash of the highstorm flood then been deposited as the water slowly receded There were no Parshendi among them and they were broken and torn from either their fall or the crush of the flood Many were missing limbs The stink of blood and viscera hung in the humid air Kaladin held his torch aloft as his companions fell silent The dank chill kept the bodies from rotting too quickly though the dampness counteracted some of that The cremlings had begun chewing the skin off hands and gnawing out the eyes Soon the stomachs would bloat with gas Some rotsprentiny red translucentscrambled across the corpses Syl floated down and landed on his shoulder making disgusted noises As usual she offered no explanation for her absence The men knew what to do Even with the rotspren this was too rich a place to pass up They went to work pulling the corpses into a line so they could be inspected Kaladin waved for Rock and Teft to join him as he picked up some stray bits of salvage that lay on the ground around the corpses Dunny tagged along Those bodies wear the highprinces colors Rock noted as Kaladin picked up a dented steel cap Ill bet theyre from that run a few days back Kaladin said It went badly for Sadeass forces Brightlord Sadeas Dunny said Then he ducked his head in embarrassment Sorry I didnt mean to correct you I used to forget to say the title My master beat me when I did Master Teft asked picking up a fallen spear and pulling some moss off its shaft I was an apprentice I mean before Dunny trailed off then looked away Teft had been right bridgemen didnt like talking about their pasts Anyway Dunny was probably right to correct him Kaladin would be punished if he were heard omitting a lighteyess honorific Kaladin put the cap in his sack then rammed his torch into a gap between two mosscovered boulders and started helping the others get the bodies into a line He didnt prod the men toward conversation The fallen deserved some reverenceif that was possible while robbing them Next the bridgemen stripped the fallen of their armor Leather vests from the archers steel breastplates from the foot soldiers This group included a lighteyes in fine clothing beneath even finer armor Sometimes the bodies of fallen lighteyes would be recovered from the chasms by special teams so the corpse could be Soulcast into a statue Darkeyes unless they were very wealthy were burned And most soldiers who fell into the chasms were ignored the men in camp spoke of the chasms being hallowed resting places but the truth was that the effort to get the bodies out wasnt worth the cost or the danger Regardless to find a lighteyes here meant that his family hadnt been wealthy enough or concerned enough to send men out to recover him His face was crushed beyond recognition but his rank insignia identified him as seventh dahn Landless attached to a more powerful officers retinue Once they had his armor they pulled daggers and boots off everyone in lineboots were always in demand They left the fallen their clothing though they took off the belts and cut free many shirt buttons As they worked Kaladin sent Teft and Rock around the bend to see if there were any other bodies nearby Once the armor weapons and boots had been separated the most grisly task began searching pockets and pouches for spheres and jewelry This pile was the smallest of the lot but valuable They didnt find any broams which meant no pitiful reward for the bridgemen As the men performed their morbid task Kaladin noticed the end of a spear poking out of a nearby pool It had gone unnoticed in their initial sweep Lost in thought he fetched it shaking off the water carrying it over to the weapons pile He hesitated there holding the spear over the pile with one hand cold water dripping from it He rubbed his finger along the smooth wood He could tell from the heft balance and sanding that it was a good weapon Sturdy well made well kept He closed his eyes remembering days as a boy holding a quarterstaff Words spoken by Tukks years ago returned to him words spoken on that bright summer day when hed first held a weapon in Amarams army The first step is to care Tukkss voice seemed to whisper Some talk about being emotionless in battle Well I suppose its important to keep your head But I hate that feeling of killing while calm and cold Ive seen that those who care fight harder longer and better than those who dont Its the difference between mercenaries and real soldiers Its the difference between fighting to defend your homeland and fighting on foreign soil Its good to care when you fight so long as you dont let it consume you Dont try to stop yourself from feeling Youll hate who you become The spear quivered in Kaladins fingers as if begging him to swing it spin it dance with it What are you planning to do lordling a voice called Going to ram that spear into your own gut Kaladin glanced up at the speaker Moashstill one of Kaladins biggest detractorsstood near the line of corpses How had he known to call Kaladin lordling Had he been talking to Gaz He claims hes a deserter Moash said to Narm the man working next to him Says he was some important soldier a squadleader or the like But Gaz says thats all stupid boasting They wouldnt send a man to the bridges if he actually knew how to fight Kaladin lowered the spear Moash smirked turning back to his work Others however had now noticed Kaladin Look at him Sigzil said Ho bridgeleader You think that youre grand That you are better than us You think pretending that were your own personal troop of soldiers will change anything Leave him alone Drehy said He shoved Sigzil as he passed At least he tries Earless Jacks snorted pulling a boot free from a dead foot He cares about looking important Even if he was in the army Ill bet he spent his days cleaning out latrines It appeared that there was something that would pull the bridgemen out of their silent stupors loathing for Kaladin Others began talking calling gibes his fault were down here wants to run us ragged during our only free time just so he can feel important sent us to carry rocks to show us he could shove us around bet hes never held a spear in his life Kaladin closed his eyes listening to their scorn rubbing his fingers on the wood Never held a spear in his life Maybe if hed never picked up that first spear none of this would have happened He felt the smooth wood slick with rainwater memories jumbling in his head Training to forget training to get vengeance training to learn and make sense of what had happened Without thinking about it he snapped the spear up under his arm into a guard position point down Water droplets from its length sprayed across his back Moash cut off in the middle of another gibe The bridgemen sputtered to a stop The chasm became quiet And Kaladin was in another place He was listening to Tukks chide him He was listening to Tien laugh He was hearing his mother tease him in her clever witty way He was on the battlefield surrounded by enemies but ringed by friends He was listening to his father tell him with a sneer in his voice that spears were only for killing You could not kill to protect He was alone in a chasm deep beneath the earth holding the spear of a fallen man fingers gripping the wet wood a faint dripping coming from somewhere distant Strength surged through him as he spun the spear up into an advanced kata His body moved of its own accord going through the forms hed trained in so frequently The spear danced in his fingers comfortable an extension of himself He spun with it swinging it around and around across his neck over his arm in and out of jabs and swings Though it had been months since hed even held a weapon his muscles knew what to do It was as if the spear itself knew what to do Tension melted away frustration melted away and his body sighed in contentment even as he worked it furiously This was familiar This was welcome This was what it had been created to do Men had always told Kaladin that he fought like nobody else Hed felt it on the first day hed picked up a quarterstaff though Tukkss advice had helped him refine and channel what he could do Kaladin had cared when he fought Hed never fought empty or cold He fought to keep his men alive Of all the recruits in his cohort he had learned the quickest How to hold the spear how to stand to spar Hed done it almost without instruction That had shocked Tukks But why should it have You were not shocked when a child knew how to breathe You were not shocked when a skyeel took flight for the first time You should not be shocked when you hand Kaladin Stormblessed a spear and he knows how to use it Kaladin spun through the last motions of the kata chasm forgotten bridgemen forgotten fatigue forgotten For a moment it was just him Him and the wind He fought with her and she laughed He snapped the spear back into place holding the haft at the onequarter position spearhead down bottom of the haft tucked underneath his arm end rising back behind his head He breathed in deeply shivering Oh how Ive missed that He opened his eyes Sputtering torchlight revealed a group of stunned bridgemen standing in a damp corridor of stone the walls wet and reflecting the light Moash dropped a handful of spheres in stunned silence staring at Kaladin with mouth agape Those spheres plopped into the puddle at his feet causing it to glow but none of the bridgemen noticed They just stared at Kaladin who was still in a battle stance half crouched trails of sweat running down the sides of his face He blinked realizing what hed done If word got back to Gaz that he was playing around with spearsKaladin stood up straight and dropped the spear into the pile of weapons Sorry he whispered to it though he didnt know why Then louder he said Back to work I dont want to be caught down here when night falls The bridgemen jumped into motion Down the chasm corridor he saw Rock and Teft Had they seen the entire kata Flushing Kaladin hurried up to them Syl landed on his shoulder silent Kaladin lad Teft said reverently That was It was meaningless Kaladin said Just a kata Meant to work the muscles and make you practice the basic jabs thrusts and sweeps Its a lot showier than it is useful But No really Kaladin said Can you imagine a man swinging a spear around his neck like that in combat Hed be gutted in a second Lad Teft said Ive seen katas before But never one like that The way you movedThe speed the graceAnd there was some sort of spren zipping around you between your sweeps glowing with a pale light It was beautiful Rock started You could see that Sure Teft said Never seen a spren like that Ask the other menI saw a few of them pointing Kaladin glanced at his shoulder frowning at Syl She sat primly legs crossed and hands folded atop her knee pointedly not looking at him It was nothing Kaladin repeated No Rock said That it certainly was not Perhaps you should challenge Shardbearer You could become brightlord I dont want to be a brightlord Kaladin snapped perhaps more harshly than he should have The other two jumped Besides he added looking away from them I tried that once Wheres Dunny Wait Teft said you Where is Dunny Kaladin said firmly punctuating each word Stormfather I need to keep my mouth shut Teft and Rock shared a glance then Teft pointed We found some dead Parshendi around the bend Thought youd want to know Parshendi Kaladin said Lets go look Might have something valuable Hed never looted Parshendi bodies before fewer of them fell into the chasms than Alethi Is true Rock said leading the way carrying a lit torch Those weapons they have yes very nice And gemstones in their beards Not to mention the armor Kaladin said Rock shook his head No armor Rock Ive seen their armor They always wear it Well yes but we can not use this thing I dont understand Kaladin said Come Rock said gesturing Is easier than explaining Kaladin shrugged and they rounded the corner Rock scratching at his redbearded chin Stupid hairs he muttered Ah to have it right again A man is not proper man without proper beard Kaladin rubbed his own beard One of these days hed save up and buy a razor and be rid of the blasted thing Or well probably not His spheres would be needed elsewhere They rounded the corner and found Dunny pulling the Parshendi bodies into a line There were four of them and they looked like theyd been swept in from another direction There were a few more Alethi bodies here too Kaladin strode forward waving Rock to bring the light and knelt to inspect one of the Parshendi dead They were like parshmen with skin in marbled patterns of black and crimson Their only clothing was kneelength black skirts Three wore beards which was unusual for parshmen and those were woven with uncut gemstones Just as Kaladin had expected they wore armor of a pale red color Breastplates helms on the heads guards on the arms and legs Extensive armor for regular foot soldiers Some of it was cracked from the fall or the wash It wasnt metal then Painted wood I thought you said they werent armored Kaladin said What are you trying to tell me That you dont dare take it off the dead Dont dare Rock said Kaladin Master Brightlord brilliant bridgeleader spinner of spear perhaps you will get it off them Kaladin shrugged His father had instilled in him a familiarity with the dead and dying and though it felt bad to rob the dead he was not squeamish He prodded the first Parshendi noting the mans knife He took it and looked for the strap that held the shoulder guard in place There was no strap Kaladin frowned and peered underneath the guard trying to pry it up The skin lifted with it Stormfather he said He inspected the helm It was grown into the head Or grown from the head What is this Do not know Rock said shrugging It is looking like they grow their own armor eh Thats ridiculous Kaladin said Theyre just people Peopleeven parshmendont grow armor Parshendi do Teft said Kaladin and the other two turned to him Dont look at me like that the older man said with a scowl I worked in the camp for a few years before I ended up as a bridgemanno Im not going to tell you how so storm off Anyway the soldiers talk about it The Parshendi grow carapaces Ive known parshmen Kaladin said There were a couple of them in my hometown serving the citylord None of them grew armor Well these are a different kind of parshman Teft said with a scowl Bigger stronger They can jump chasms for Keleks sake And they grow armor Thats just how it is There was no disputing it so they just moved on to gathering what they could Many Parshendi used heavy weaponsaxes hammersand those hadnt been carried along with the bodies like many of the spears and bows Alethi soldiers had But they did find several knives and one ornate sword still in a sheath at the Parshendis side The skirts didnt have pockets but the corpses did have pouches tied to their waists These just carried flint and tinder whetstones or other basic supplies So they knelt to begin pulling the gemstones from the beards Those gemstones had holes drilled through them to facilitate weaving and Stormlight infused them though they didnt glow as brightly as they would have if theyd been properly cut As Rock pulled the gemstones out of the final Parshendis beard Kaladin held one of the knives up near Dunnys torch inspecting the detailed carving Those look like glyphs he said showing it to Teft I cant read glyphs boy Oh right Kaladin thought Well if they were glyphs they werent ones he was familiar with Of course you could draw most glyphs in complex ways that made it hard to read them unless you knew exactly what to look for There was a figure at the center of the hilt nicely carved It was a man in fine armor Shardplate certainly A symbol was etched behind him surrounding him spreading out from his back like wings Kaladin showed it to Rock who had walked up to see what he found so fascinating The Parshendi out here are supposed to be barbarians Kaladin said Without culture Where did they get knives like these Id swear this is a picture of one of the Heralds Jezerezeh or Nalan Rock shrugged Kaladin sighed and returned the knife to its sheath then dropped it into his sack Then they rounded the curve back to the others The crew had gathered up sacks full of armor belts boots and spheres Each took up a spear to carry back to the ladder holding them like walking sticks Theyd left one for Kaladin but he tossed it to Rock He didnt trust himself to hold one of them again worried hed be tempted to fall into another kata The walk back was uneventful though with the darkening sky the men began jumping at every sound Kaladin engaged Rock Teft and Dunny in conversation again He was able to get Drehy and Torfin to talk a little as well They safely reached the first chasm much to the relief of his men Kaladin sent the others up the ladder first waiting to go up last Rock waited with him and as Dunny finally started upleaving Rock and Kaladin alonethe tall Horneater put a hand on Kaladins shoulder speaking in a soft voice You do good work here Rock said I am thinking that in a few weeks these men will be yours Kaladin shook his head Were bridgemen Rock We dont have a few weeks If I take that long winning them over half of us will be dead Rock frowned Is not a happy thought Thats why we have to win over the other men now But how Kaladin looked up at the dangling ladder shaking as the men climbed up Only four could go at a time lest they overload it Meet me after were searched Were going to the camp market Very well Rock said swinging onto the ladder as Earless Jaks reached the top What will be our purpose in this thing Were going to try out my secret weapon Rock laughed as Kaladin held the ladder steady for him And what weapon is this Kaladin smiled Actually its you Two hours later at Salass first violet light Rock and Kaladin walked back into the lumberyard It was just past sunset and many of the bridgemen would soon be going to sleep Not much time Kaladin thought gesturing for Rock to carry his burden to a place near the front of Bridge Fours barrack The large Horneater set his burden down next to Teft and Dunny who had done as Kaladin had ordered building a small ring of stones and setting up some stumps of wood from the lumberyard scrap pile That wood was free for anyone to take Even bridgemen were allowed some liked to take chunks to whittle Kaladin got out a sphere for light The thing Rock had been carrying was an old iron cauldron Even though it was secondhand it had cost Kaladin a fair chunk of the knobweed sap money The Horneater began to unpack supplies from inside the cauldron as Kaladin arranged some wood scraps inside the ring of stones Dunny water if you please Kaladin said getting out his flint Dunny ran off to fetch a bucket from one of the rain barrels Rock finished emptying the cauldron laying out small packages that had cost another substantial portion of Kaladins spheres He had only a handful of clearchips left As they worked Hobber limped out of the barrack He was mending quickly though the other two wounded that Kaladin had treated were still in bad shape What are you up to Kaladin Hobber asked just as Kaladin got a flame started Kaladin smiled standing Have a seat Hobber did just that He hadnt lost the neardevotion hed shown Kaladin for saving his life If anything his loyalty had grown stronger Dunny returned with a bucket of water which he poured into the cauldron Then he and Teft ran off to get more Kaladin built up the flames and Rock began to hum to himself as he diced tubers and unwrapped some seasonings In under a half hour they had a roaring flame and a simmering pot of stew Teft sat down on one of the stumps warming his hands This is your secret weapon Kaladin sat down next to the older man Have you known many soldiers in your life Teft A few You ever known any who could turn down a warm fire and some stew at the end of a hard day Well no But bridgemen aint soldiers That was true Kaladin turned to the barrack doorway Rock and Dunny started up a song together and Teft began to clap along Some of the men from other bridge crews were up late and they gave Kaladin and the others nothing more than scowls Figures shifted inside the barrack shadows moving The door was open and the scents of Rocks stew grew strong Inviting Come on Kaladin thought Remember why we live Remember warmth remember good food Remember friends and song and evenings spent around the hearth You arent dead yet Storm you If you dont come out It all suddenly seemed so contrived to Kaladin The singing was forced the stew an act of desperation It was all just an attempt to briefly distract from the pathetic life he had been forced into A figure moved in the doorway Skarshort squarebearded and keeneyedstepped out into the firelight Kaladin smiled at him A forced smile Sometimes that was all one could offer Let it be enough he prayed standing up dipping a wooden bowl into Rocks stew Kaladin held the bowl toward Skar Steam curled from the surface of the brownish liquid Will you join us Kaladin asked Please Skar looked at him then back down at the stew He laughed taking the stew Id join the Nightwatcher herself around a fire if there was stew involved Be careful Teft said Thats Horneater stew Might be snail shells or crab claws floating in it There is not Rock barked Is unfortunate that you have unrefined lowlander tastes but I prepare the food such as I am ordered by our dear bridgeleader Kaladin smiled letting out a deep breath as Skar sat down Others trailed out after him taking bowls sitting Some stared into the fire not saying much but others began to laugh and sing At one point Gaz walked past eyeing them with his single eye as if trying to decide if they were breaking any camp regulations They werent Kaladin had checked Kaladin dipped out a bowl of stew and held it toward Gaz The bridge sergeant snorted in derision and stalked away Cant expect too many miracles in one night Kaladin thought with a sigh settling back down and trying the stew It was quite good He smiled joining in the next verse of Dunnys song The next morning when Kaladin called for the bridgemen to rise threequarters of them piled out of the barrackeveryone but the loudest complainers Moash Sigzil Narm and a couple of others The ones who came to his call looked surprisingly refreshed despite the long evening spent singing and eating When he ordered them to join him in practice carrying the bridge almost all of those who had risen joined him Not everyone but enough He had a feeling that Moash and the others would give in before too long Theyd eaten his stew Nobody had turned that down And now that he had so many the others would feel foolish not joining in Bridge Four was his Now he had to keep them alive long enough for that to mean something For I have never been dedicated to a more important purpose and the very pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here I ask again Support me Do not stand aside and let disaster consume more lives Ive never begged you for something before old friend I do so now Adolin was frightened He stood beside his father on the staging ground Dalinar lookedweathered Creases running back from his eyes furrows in his skin Black hair going white like bleached rock along the sides How could a man standing in full Shardplatea man who yet retained a warriors frame despite his agelook fragile In front of them two chulls followed their handler stepping up onto the bridge The wooden span linked two piles of cut stones a mock chasm only a few feet deep The chulls whiplike antennae twitched mandibles clacking fistsize black eyes glancing about They pulled a massive siege bridge rolling on creaking wooden wheels Thats much wider than the bridges Sadeas uses Dalinar said to Teleb who stood beside them Its necessary to accommodate the siege bridge Brightlord Dalinar nodded absently Adolin suspected that he was the only one who could see that his father was distressed Dalinar maintained his usual confident front his head high his voice firm when he spoke Yet those eyes They were too red too strained And when Adolins father felt strained he grew cold and businesslike When he spoke to Teleb his tone was too controlled Dalinar Kholin was suddenly a man laboring beneath great weight And Adolin had helped put him there The chulls advanced Their boulderlike shells were painted blue and yellow the colors and pattern indicating the island of their Reshi handlers The bridge beneath them groaned ominously as the larger siege bridge rolled onto it All around the staging area soldiers turned to look Even the workmen cutting a latrine into the stony ground on the eastern side stopped to watch The groans from the bridge grew louder Then they became sharp cracks The handlers halted the chulls glancing toward Teleb Its not going to hold is it Adolin asked Teleb sighed Storm it I was hopingBah we made the smaller bridge too thin when we widened it But if we make it thicker it will get too heavy to carry He glanced at Dalinar I apologize for wasting your time Brightlord You are correct this is akin to the ten fools Adolin what do you think Dalinar asked Adolin frowned WellI think perhaps we should keep working with it This is only the first attempt Teleb Perhaps theres still a way Design the siege bridges to be narrower maybe That could be very costly Brightlord Teleb said If it helps us win one extra gemheart the effort would be paid for several times over Yes Teleb said nodding I will speak with Lady Kalana Perhaps she can devise a new design Good Dalinar said He stared at the bridge for an extended moment Then oddly he turned to look toward the other side of the staging area where the workers had been cutting the latrine ditch Father Adolin asked Why do you suppose Dalinar said there are no Shardplatelike suits for workmen What Shardplate gives awesome strength but we rarely use it for anything other than war and slaughter Why did the Radiants fashion only weapons Why didnt they make productive tools for use by ordinary men I dont know Adolin said Perhaps because war was the most important thing around Perhaps Dalinar said voice growing softer And perhaps thats a final condemnation of them and their ideals For all of their lofty claims they never gave their Plate or its secrets to the common people II dont understand why thats important Father Dalinar shook himself slightly We should get on with our inspections Wheres Ladent Here Brightlord A short man stepped up to Dalinar Bald and bearded the ardent wore thick bluegrey layered robes from which his hands barely extended The effect was of a crab who was too small for his shell It looked terribly hot but he didnt seem to mind Send a messenger to the Fifth Battalion Dalinar told him Well be visiting them next Yes Brightlord Adolin and Dalinar began to walk Theyd chosen to wear their Shardplate for this days inspections That wasnt uncommon many Shardbearers found any excuse they could to wear Plate Plus it was good for the men to see their highprince and his heir in their strength They drew attention as they left the staging area and entered the warcamp proper Like Adolin Dalinar went about unhelmed though the gorget of his armor was tall and thick rising like a metal collar up to his chin He nodded to soldiers who saluted Adolin Dalinar said In combat do you feel the Thrill Adolin started He knew immediately what his father meant but he was shocked to hear the words This wasnt often discussed IWell of course Who doesnt Dalinar didnt reply He had been so reserved lately Was that pain in his eyes The way he was before Adolin thought deluded but confident That was actually better Dalinar said nothing more and the two of them continued through the camp Six years had let the soldiers settle in thoroughly Barracks were painted with company and squad symbols and the space between them was outfitted with firepits stools and canvasshaded dining areas Adolins father had forbidden none of this though he had set guidelines to discourage sloppiness Dalinar had also approved most requests for families to be brought to the Shattered Plains The officers already had their wives of coursea good lighteyes officer was really a team the man to command and fight the woman to read write engineer and manage camp Adolin smiled thinking of Malasha Would she prove to be the one for him Shed been a little cold to him lately Of course there was Danlan Hed only just met her but he was intrigued Regardless Dalinar had also approved requests by darkeyed common soldiers to bring their families He even paid half of the cost When Adolin had asked why Dalinar had replied that he didnt feel right forbidding them The warcamps were never attacked anymore so there was no danger Adolin suspected his father felt that since he was living in a luxurious nearpalace his men might as well have the comfort of their families And so it was that children played and ran through the camp Women hung wash and painted glyphwards as men sharpened spears and polished breastplates Barrack interiors had been partitioned to create rooms I think you were right Adolin said as they walked trying to draw his father out of his contemplations To let so many bring their families here I mean Yes but how many will leave when this is over Does it matter Im not certain The Shattered Plains are now a de facto Alethi province How will this place appear in a hundred years Will those rings of barracks become neighborhoods The outer shops become markets The hills to the west become fields for planting He shook his head The gemhearts will always be here it seems And so long as they are there will be people here as well Thats a good thing isnt it So long as those people are Alethi Adolin chuckled Perhaps And what will happen to the value of gemstones if we continue to capture gemhearts at the rate we have I That was a good question What happens I wonder when the scarcest yet most desirable substance in the land suddenly becomes commonplace Theres much going on here son Much we havent considered The gemhearts the Parshendi the death of Gavilar You will have to be ready to consider these things Me Adolin said What does that mean Dalinar didnt answer instead nodding as the commander of the Fifth Battalion hastened up to them and saluted Adolin sighed and saluted back The Twentyfirst and Twentysecond Companies were doing close order drill herean essential exercise whose true value few outside the military ever appreciated The Twentythird and Twentyfourth Companies were doing extended orderor combatdrill practicing the formations and movements used on the battlefield Fighting on the Shattered Plains was very different from regular warfare as the Alethi had learned from some embarrassing early losses The Parshendi were squat muscular and had that strange skingrown armor of theirs It didnt cover as fully as plate but it was far more efficient than what most foot soldiers had Each Parshendi was essentially an extremely mobile heavy infantryman The Parshendi always attacked in pairs eschewing a regular line of battle That should have made it easy for a disciplined line to defeat them But each pair of Parshendi had such momentumand was so well armoredthat they could break right through a shield wall Alternatively their jumping prowess could suddenly deposit entire ranks of Parshendi behind Alethi lines Beyond all that there was that distinctive way they moved as a group in combat They maneuvered with an inexplicable coordination What had seemed at first to be mere barbarian savagery turned out to disguise something more subtle and dangerous Theyd found only two reliable ways to defeat the Parshendi The first was to use a Shardblade Effective but of limited application The Kholin army had only two Blades and while Shards were incredibly powerful they needed proper support An isolated outnumbered Shardbearer could be tripped and toppled by his adversaries In fact the one time Adolin had seen a full Shardbearer fall to a regular soldier it had happened because he had been swarmed by spearmen who broke his breastplate Then a lighteyed archer had slain him from fifty paces winning the Shards for himself Not exactly a heroic end The other reliable way to fight Parshendi depended on quickmoving formations Flexibility mixed with discipline flexibility to respond to the uncanny way Parshendi fought discipline to maintain lines and make up for individual Parshendi strength Havrom Fifth Battalionlord waited for Adolin and Dalinar with his companylords in a line They saluted right fists to right shoulders knuckles outward Dalinar nodded to them Have my orders been seen to Brightlord Havrom Yes Highprince Havrom was built like a tower and wore a beard with long sides after the Horneater fashion chin cleanshaven He had relatives among the Peakfolk The men you wanted are waiting in the audience tent Whats this Adolin asked Ill show you in a moment Dalinar said First review the troops Adolin frowned but the soldiers were waiting One company at a time Havrom had the men fall in Adolin walked before them inspecting their lines and uniforms They were neat and orderly though Adolin knew that some of the soldiers in their army grumbled at the level of polish required of them He happened to agree with them on that point At the end of the inspection he questioned a few random men asked their rank and if they had any specific concerns None had any Were they satisfied or just intimidated When he was done Adolin returned to his father You did that well Dalinar said All I did was walk down a line Yes but the presentation was good The men know you care for their needs and they respect you He nodded as if to himself Youve learned well I think youre reading too much into a simple inspection Father Dalinar nodded to Havrom and the battalionlord led the two of them to an audience tent near the side of the practice field Adolin puzzled glanced at his father I had Havrom gather the soldiers that Sadeas spoke to the other day Dalinar said The ones he interviewed while we were on our way to the plateau assault Ah Adolin said Well want to know what he asked them Yes Dalinar said He gestured for Adolin to enter before him and they walked intailed by a few of Dalinars ardents Inside a group of ten soldiers waited on benches They rose and saluted At ease Dalinar said clasping plated hands behind his back Adolin Dalinar nodded toward the men indicating that Adolin should take the lead in the questioning Adolin stifled a sigh Again Men we need to know what Sadeas asked you and how you responded Dont worry Brightlord said one of the men speaking with a rural northern Alethi accent We didnt tell him nothing The others nodded vigorously Hes an eel and we know it another added He is a highprince Dalinar said sternly You will treat him with respect The soldier paled then nodded What specifically did he ask you Adolin asked He wanted to know our duties in the camp Brightlord the man said Were grooms you see Each soldier was trained in one or two additional skills beyond those of combat Having a group of soldiers who could care for horses was useful as it kept civilians from plateau assaults He asked around said one of the men Or well his people did Found out we were in charge of the kings horse during the chasmfiend hunt But we didnt say nothing the first soldier repeated Nothing to get you into trouble sir Were not going to give that eeer that highprince Brightlord sir the rope to hang you sir Adolin closed his eyes If they had acted this way around Sadeas it would have been more incriminating than the cut girth itself He couldnt fault their loyalty but they acted as if they assumed Dalinar had done something wrong and needed to defend him He opened his eyes I spoke to some of you before I recall But let me ask again Did any of you see a cut strap on the kings saddle The men looked at each other shaking heads No Brightlord one of the men replied If wed seen it wed have changed it right we would But Brightlord one of the men added there was a lot of confusion that day and a lot of people Wasnt a right regular plateau assault or nothing like that And well to be honest sir whod have thought that wed need to protect the kings saddle of all things under the Halls Dalinar nodded to Adolin and they stepped out of the tent Well They probably didnt do much to help our cause Adolin said with a grimace Despite their ardor Or rather because of it Agreed unfortunately Dalinar let out a sigh He waved to Tadet the short ardent was standing to the side of the tent Interview them separately Dalinar told him softly See if you can tease specifics from them Try to find out the exact words Sadeas used and what their exact responses were Yes Brightlord Come Adolin Dalinar said Weve still got a few inspections to do Father Adolin said taking Dalinars arm Their armor clinked softly Dalinar turned to him frowning and Adolin made a quick gesture toward the Cobalt Guard A request for space to speak The guards moved efficiently and quickly clearing a private space around the two men What is this about Father Adolin demanded softly What Were doing inspections and seeing to camp business And in each case you shove me out into the lead Adolin said Awkwardly in a few cases I might add Whats wrong Whats going on inside that head of yours I thought you had a distinct problem with the things going on inside my head Adolin winced Father I No its all right Adolin Im just trying to make a difficult decision It helps me to move about while I do it Dalinar grimaced Another man might find a place to sit and brood but that never seems to help me Ive got too much to do What is it youre trying to decide Adolin asked Perhaps I can help You already have I Dalinar cut off frowning A small force of soldiers was walking up to the Fifth Battalions practice yards They were escorting a man in red and brown Those were Thanadals colors Dont you have a meeting with him this evening Adolin asked Yes Dalinar said Niterhead of the Cobalt Guardran to intercept the newcomers He could be overly suspicious at times but that wasnt a terrible trait for a bodyguard to have He returned to Dalinar and Adolin shortly Tanfaced Niter bore a black beard cut short He was a lighteyes of very low rank and had been with the guard for years He says that Highprince Thanadal will be unable to meet with you today as planned Dalinars expression grew dark I will speak to the runner myself Reluctantly Niter waved the spindly fellow forward He approached and dropped to one knee before Dalinar Brightlord This time Dalinar didnt ask for Adolin to take the lead Deliver your message Brightlord Thanadal regrets that he is unable to attend you this day And did he offer another time to meet He regrets to say that he has grown too busy But he would be happy to speak with you at the kings feast one evening In public Adolin thought where half the men nearby will be eavesdropping while the other halflikely including Thanadal himselfwill probably be drunk I see Dalinar said And did he give any indication of when hed no longer be so busy Brightlord the messenger said growing uncomfortable He said that if you pressed I should explain that he has spoken with several of the other highprinces and feels he knows the nature of your inquiry He said to tell you he does not wish to form an alliance nor does he have any intention of going on a joint plateau assault with you Dalinars expression grew darker He dismissed the messenger with a wave then turned to Adolin The Cobalt Guard still kept a space open around them so they could talk Thanadal was the last of them Dalinar said Each highprince had turned him down in his own way Hatham with exceeding politeness Bethab by letting his wife give the explanation Thanadal with hostile civility All of them but Sadeas at least I doubt it would be wise to approach him with this Father Youre probably right Dalinars voice was cold He was angry Furious even Theyre sending me a message Theyve never liked the influence I have over the king and theyre eager to see me fall They dont want to do something I ask them to just in case it might help me regain my footing Father Im sorry Perhaps its for the best The important point is that I have failed I cant get them to work together Elhokar was right He looked to Adolin I would like you to continue inspections for me son Theres something I want to do What Just some work I see needs to be done Adolin wanted to object but he couldnt think of the words to say Finally he sighed and gave a nod Youll tell me what this is about though Soon Dalinar promised Very soon Dalinar watched his son leave striding purposefully away He would make a good highprince Dalinars decision was a simple one Was it time to step aside and let his son take his place If he took this step Dalinar would be expected to stay out of politics retiring to his lands and leaving Adolin to rule It was a painful decision to contemplate and he had to be careful not to make it hastily But if he really was going mad as everyone in the camp seemed to believe then he had to step down And soon before his condition progressed to the point that he no longer had the presence of mind to let go A monarch is control he thought remembering a passage from The Way of Kings He provides stability It is his service and his trade good If he can not control himself then how can he control the lives of men What merchant worth his Stormlight wont partake of the very fruit he sells Odd that those quotes still came to him even as he was wondering if they hadin partdriven him to madness Niter he said Fetch my warhammer Have it waiting for me at the staging field Dalinar wanted to be moving working as he thought His guards hastened to keep up as he strode down the pathway between the barracks of Battalions Six and Seven Niter sent several men to fetch the weapon His voice sounded strangely excited as if he thought Dalinar was going to do something impressive Dalinar doubted he would think it so He eventually strode out onto the staging field cape fluttering behind him plated boots clanking against the stones He didnt have to wait long for the hammer it came pulled by two men on a small cart Sweating the soldiers heaved it from the cart the haft as thick as a mans wrist and the front of the head larger than an outspread palm Two men together could barely lift it Dalinar grabbed the hammer with one gauntleted hand swinging it up to rest on his shoulder He ignored the soldiers performing exercises on the field walking to where the group of dirty workers chipped at the latrine ditch They looked up at him horrified to see the highprince himself looming over them in full Shardplate Whos in charge here Dalinar asked A scruffy civilian in brown trousers raised a nervous hand Brightlord how may we serve you By relaxing for a little while Dalinar said Out with you The worried workers scrambled out Lighteyed officers gathered behind confused by Dalinars actions Dalinar gripped the haft of his warhammer in a gauntleted hand the metal shaft was wrapped tightly with leather Taking a deep breath he leaped down into the halffinished ditch lifted the hammer then swung slamming the weapon down against the rock A powerful crack rang across the practice field and a wave of shock ran up Dalinars arms The Shardplate absorbed most of the recoil and he left a large crack in the stones He hefted and swung again this time breaking free a large section of rock Though it would have been difficult for two or three regular men to lift Dalinar grabbed it with one hand and tossed it aside It clattered across the stones Where were the Shards for regular men Why hadnt the ancients who were so wise created anything to help them As Dalinar continued to work beats of his hammer throwing chips and dust into the air he easily did the work of twenty men Shardplate could be used for so many things to ease the lives of workers and darkeyes across Roshar It felt good to be working To be doing something useful Lately he felt as if his efforts had been akin to running about in circles The work helped him think He was losing his thirst for battle That worried him as the Thrillthe enjoyment and longing for warwas part of what drove the Alethi as a people The grandest of masculine arts was to become a great warrior and the most important Calling was to fight The Almighty himself depended on the Alethi to train themselves in honorable battle so that when they died they could join the Heralds army and win back the Tranquiline Halls And yet thinking about killing was starting to sicken him It had grown worse since that last bridge assault What would happen next time he went into battle He could not lead this way That was a major reason that abdicating in favor of Adolin looked right He continued to swing Again and again beating against the stones Soldiers gathered above anddespite his ordersthe workers did not leave to relax They watched dumbfounded as a Shardbearer did their work Occasionally he summoned his Blade and used it to cut the rock slicing out sections before returning to the hammer to break them apart He probably looked ridiculous He couldnt do the work of all of the laborers in camp and he had important tasks to fill his time There was no reason for him to get down in a trench and toil And yet it felt so good So wonderful to pitch in directly with the needs of the camp The results of what he did to protect Elhokar were often difficult to gauge it was fulfilling to be able to do something where his progress was obvious But even in this he was acting according to the ideals that had infected him The book spoke of a king carrying the burdens of his people It said that those who led were the lowest of men for they were required to serve everyone It all swirled around in him The Codes the teachings of the book the things the visionsor delusionsshowed Never fight other men except when forced to in war Bang Let your actions defend you not your words Bang Expect honor from those you meet and give them the chance to live up to it Bang Rule as you would be ruled Bang He stood waistdeep in what would eventually be a latrine his ears filled with the groans of breaking stone He was coming to believe those ideals No hed already come to believe them Now he was living them What would the world be like if all men lived as the book proclaimed Someone had to start Someone had to be the model In this he had a reason not to abdicate Whether or not he was mad the way he now did things was better than the way Sadeas or the others did them One needed only look at the lives of his soldiers and his people to see that was true Bang Stone could not be changed without pounding Was it the same with a man like him Was that why everything was so hard for him suddenly But why him Dalinar wasnt a philosopher or idealist He was a soldier Andif he admitted the truthin earlier years hed been a tyrant and a warmonger Could twilight years spent pretending to follow the precepts of better men erase a lifetime of butchery He had begun to sweat The swath he had cut through the ground was as wide as a man was tall as deep as his chest and some thirty yards long The longer he worked the more people gathered to watch and whisper Shardplate was sacred Was the highprince really digging a latrine with it Had the stress affected him that profoundly Frightened of highstorms Growing cowardly Refusing to duel or defend himself from slurs Afraid of fighting wishing to give up the war Suspected of trying to kill the king Eventually Teleb decided that letting all the people stare down at Dalinar wasnt respectful and he ordered the men back to their separate duties He cleared away the workers taking Dalinars order to heart and commanding them to sit in the shade and converse in a lighthearted manner From someone else that command might have been said with a smile but Teleb was as literal as the rocks themselves Still Dalinar worked He knew where the latrine was supposed to end hed approved the work order A long sloping trough was to be cut then covered with oiled and tarred boards to seal in the scent A latrine house would be set at the high end and the contents could be Soulcast to smoke once every few months The work felt even better once he was alone One man breaking rocks pounding beat after beat Like the drums the Parshendi had played on that day so long past Dalinar could feel those beats still could hear them in his mind shaking him Im sorry brother He had spoken to the ardents about his visions They felt that the visions were most likely a product of an overtaxed mind He had no reason to believe the truth of anything the visions showed him In following them he had done more than just ignore Sadeass maneuvers hed depleted his resources precariously His reputation was on the brink of ruin He was in danger of dragging down the entire Kholin house And that was the most important point in favor of him abdicating If he continued his actions could very well lead to the deaths of Adolin Renarin and Elhokar He would risk his own life for his ideals but could he risk the lives of his sons Chips sprayed bouncing off his Plate He was beginning to feel worn and tired The Plate didnt do the work for himit enhanced his strength so each strike of the hammer was his own His fingers were growing numb from the repeated vibration of the hammers haft He was close to a decision His mind was calm clear He swung the hammer again Wouldnt the Blade be more efficient asked a dry feminine voice Dalinar froze the hammers head resting on broken stone He turned to see Navani standing beside the trough wearing a gown of blue and soft red her greysprinkled hair reflecting light from a sun that was unexpectedly close to setting She was attended by two young womennot her own wards but ones she had borrowed from other lighteyed women in the camp Navani stood with her arms folded the sunlight behind her like a halo Dalinar hesitantly raised an armored forearm to block the light Mathana The rockwork Navani said nodding to the trough Now I wouldnt presume to make judgments hitting things is a masculine art But are you not in the possession of a sword that can cut through stone as easily asI once had it described to mea highstorm blows over a Herdazian Dalinar looked back at the rocks Then he raised his hammer again and slammed it into the stones making a satisfying crunch Shardblades are too good at cutting Curious she said Ill do my best to pretend there was sense in that As an aside has it ever struck you that most masculine arts deal with destroying while feminine arts deal with creation Dalinar swung again Bang Remarkable how much easier it was to have a conversation with Navani while not looking directly at her I do use the Blade to cut down the sides and middle But I still have to break up the rocks Have you ever tried to lift out a chunk of stone that has been sliced by a Shardblade I cant say that I have Its not easy Bang Blades make a very thin cut The rocks still press against one another Its hard to grasp or move them Bang Its more complicated than it seems Bang This is the best way Navani dusted a few chips of stone from her dress And more messy I see Bang So are you going to apologize she asked For For missing our appointment Dalinar froze in midswing Hed completely forgotten that at the feast when shed first returned hed agreed to have Navani read for him today He hadnt told his scribes of the appointment He turned toward her chagrined Hed been angered because Thanadal had canceled their appointment but at least he had thought to send a messenger Navani stood with arms folded safehand tucked away sleek dress seeming to burn with sunlight She bore a hint of a smile on her lips By standing her up hed put himselfby honorin her power Im truly sorry he said Ive had some difficult things to consider lately but that doesnt excuse forgetting you I know Ill ponder a way to let you make up for the lapse But for now you should know that one of your spanreeds is flashing What Which one Your scribes say it is the one bound to my daughter Jasnah It had been weeks since theyd last communicated the messages hed sent her had prompted only the tersest of answers When Jasnah was deeply immersed in one of her projects she often ignored all else If she was sending to him now either shed discovered something or she was taking a break to renew her contacts Dalinar turned to look down the latrine Hed nearly completed it and he realized hed been unconsciously planning to make his final decision once he reached the end He itched to continue working But if Jasnah wanted to converse He needed to talk with her Perhaps he could persuade her to return to the Shattered Plains He would feel a lot more secure about abdicating if he knew that she would come watch over Elhokar and Adolin Dalinar tossed aside his hammerhis pounding had bent the haft a good thirty degrees and the head was a misshapen lumpand jumped out of the ditch Hed have a new weapon forged that was not unusual for Shardbearers Your pardon Mathana Dalinar said but I fear I must beg your leave so soon after begging your forgiveness I must receive this communication He bowed to her and turned to hurry away Actually Navani said from behind I think Ill beg something of you It has been months since Ive spoken with my daughter Ill join you if youll permit it He hesitated but he couldnt deny her so soon after giving her offense Of course He waited as Navani walked to her palanquin and settled herself The bearers lifted it and Dalinar struck out again the bearers and Navanis borrowed wards walking close You are a kind man Dalinar Kholin Navani said that same sly smile on her lips as she sat back in the cushioned chair Im afraid that Im compelled to find you fascinating My sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate Dalinar said eyes forward Dealing with her was not something he needed right now I know it does No need to toy with me Navani She laughed softly Im not trying to take advantage of you Dalinar I She paused Well perhaps I am taking advantage of you just a little But Im not toying with you This last year in particular youve begun to be the person the others all claim that they are Cant you see how intriguing that makes you I dont do it to be intriguing If you did it wouldnt work She leaned toward him Do you know why I picked Gavilar instead of you all those years ago Blast Her commentsher presencewere like a goblet of darkwine poured into the middle of his crystal thoughts The clarity hed sought in hard labor was quickly vanishing Did she have to be so forward He didnt answer the question Instead he picked up his pace and hoped that shed see he didnt want to discuss the topic It was no use I didnt pick him because he would become king Dalinar Though thats what everyone says I chose him because you frightened me That intensity of yoursit scared your brother too you know He said nothing Its still in there she said I can see it in your eyes But youve wrapped armor around it a glistening set of Shardplate to contain it That is part of what I find fascinating He stopped looking at her The palanquin bearers halted This would not work Navani he said softly Wouldnt it He shook his head I will not dishonor my brothers memory He regarded her sternly and she eventually nodded When he continued walking she said nothing though she did eye him slyly from time to time Eventually they reached his personal complex marked by fluttering blue banners with the glyphpair khokh and linil the former drawn in the shape of a crown the second forming a tower Dalinars mother had drawn the original design the same his signet ring bore though Elhokar used a sword and crown instead The soldiers at the entrance to his complex saluted and Dalinar waited for Navani to join him before entering The cavernous interior was lit by infused sapphires Once they reached his sitting chamber he was again struck by just how lavish it had gotten over the months Three of his clerks waited with their attending girls All six stood up when he entered Adolin was also there Dalinar frowned at the youth Shouldnt you be seeing to the inspections Adolin started Father I finished those hours ago You did Stormfather How long did I spend pounding on those stones Father Adolin said stepping up to him Can we speak privately for a moment As usual Adolins blackpeppered blond hair was an unruly mop Hed changed from his Plate and bathed and now he wore a fashionablethough battleworthyuniform with a long blue coat buttoned at the sides and straight stiff brown trousers beneath Im not ready to discuss that as yet son Dalinar said softly I need a little more time Adolin studied him eyes concerned He will make a fine highprince Dalinar thought Hes been reared to it in a way that I never was All right then Adolin said But theres something else I want to ask you He pointed toward one of the clerks a woman with auburn hair and only a few strands of black She was lithe and longnecked wearing a green dress her hair arranged high on her head in a complex set of braids held together with four traditional steel hairspikes This is Danlan Morakotha Adolin said softly to Dalinar She came into camp yesterday to spend a few months with her father Brightlord Morakotha She has been calling on me recently and I took the liberty of offering her a position among your clerks while she is here Dalinar blinked What about Malasha Adolin sighed Didnt work out And this one Dalinar asked voice hushed yet incredulous How long did you say shes been in camp Since yesterday And youve already got her calling on you Adolin shrugged Well I do have a reputation to maintain Dalinar sighed eyeing Navani who stood close enough to hear She pretendedfor proprietythat she wasnt listening in You know it is customary to eventually choose just one woman to court Youre going to need a good wife son Perhaps very soon When Im old and boring perhaps Adolin said smiling at the young woman She was pretty But only in camp one day Blood of my ancestors Dalinar thought Hed spent three years courting the woman whod eventually become his wife Even if he couldnt remember her face he did remember how persistently hed pursued her Surely hed loved her All emotion regarding her was gone wiped from his mind by forces he should never have tempted Unfortunately he did remember how much hed desired Navani years before meeting the woman who would become his wife Stop that he told himself Moments ago hed been on the brink of deciding to abdicate his seat as highprince It was no time to let Navani distract him Brightness Danlan Morakotha he said to the young woman You are welcome among my clerks I understand that Ive received a communication Indeed Brightlord the woman said curtsying She nodded to the line of five spanreeds sitting on his bookshelf set upright in pen holders The spanreeds looked like ordinary writing reeds except that each had a small infused ruby affixed The one on the far right pulsed slowly Litima was there and though she had seniority she nodded for Danlan to fetch the spanreed The young woman hurried to the bookshelf and moved the stillblinking reed to the small writing desk beside the lectern She carefully clipped a piece of paper onto the writing board and put the ink vial into its hole twisting it snugly into place and then pulling the stopper Lighteyed women were very proficient at working with just their freehand She sat down looking up at him seeming slightly nervous Dalinar didnt trust her of courseshe could easily be a spy for one of the other highprinces Unfortunately there werent any women in camp he trusted completely not with Jasnah gone I am ready Brightlord Danlan said She had a breathy husky voice Just the type that attracted Adolin He hoped she wasnt as vapid as those he usually picked Proceed Dalinar said waving Navani toward one of the rooms plush easy chairs The other clerks sat back down on their bench Danlan turned the spanreeds gemstone one notch indicating that the request had been acknowledged Then she checked the levels on the sides of the writing boardsmall vials of oil with bubbles at the center which allowed her to make the board perfectly flat Finally she inked the reed and placed it on the dot at the top left of the page Holding it upright she twisted the gemstone setting one more time with her thumb Then she removed her hand The reed remained in place tip against the paper hovering as if held in a phantom hand Then it began to write mimicking the exact movements Jasnah made miles away writing with a reed conjoined to this one Dalinar stood beside the writing table armored arms folded He could see that his proximity made Danlan nervous but he was too anxious to sit Jasnah had elegant handwriting of courseJasnah rarely did anything without taking the time to perfect it Dalinar leaned forward as the familiaryet indecipherablelines appeared on the page in stark violet Faint wisps of reddish smoke floated up from the gemstone The pen stopped writing freezing in place Uncle Danlan read I presume that you are well Indeed Dalinar replied I am well cared for by those around me The words were code indicating that he didnt trustor at least didnt knoweveryone listening Jasnah would be careful not to send anything too sensitive Danlan took the pen and twisted the gemstone then wrote out the words sending them across the ocean to Jasnah Was she still in Tukar After Danlan finished writing she returned it to the dot at the top leftthe spot where the pens were both to be placed so Jasnah could continue the conversationthen turned the gemstone back to the previous setting As I expected I have found my way to Kharbranth Danlan read The secrets I seek are too obscure to be contained even in the Palanaeum but I find hints Tantalizing fragments Is Elhokar well Hints Fragments Of what She had a penchant for drama Jasnah did though she wasnt as flamboyant about it as the king Your brother tried very hard to get himself killed by a chasmfiend a few weeks back Dalinar replied Adolin smiled at that leaning with his shoulder against the bookcase But evidently the Heralds watch over him He is well though your presence here is sorely missed Im certain he could use your counsel He is relying heavily on Brightness Lalai to act as clerk Perhaps that would make Jasnah return There was little love lost between herself and Sadeass cousin who was the kings head scribe in the queens absence Danlan scratched away writing the words To the side Navani cleared her throat Oh Dalinar said add this Your mother is here in the warcamps again A short time later the pen wrote of its own volition Send my mother my respect Keep her at arms length Uncle She bites From the side Navani sniffed and Dalinar realized he hadnt signaled that Navani was actually listening He blushed as Danlan continued speaking I can not speak of my work via spanreed but Im growing increasingly concerned There is something here hidden by the sheer number of accrued pages in the historical record Jasnah was a Veristitalian Shed explained it to him once they were an order of scholars who tried to find the truth in the past They wished to create unbiased factual accounts of what had happened in order to extrapolate what to do in the future He wasnt clear on why they thought themselves different from regular historians Will you be returning Dalinar asked I can not say Danlan read after the reply came I do not dare stop my research But a time may soon come when I dare not stay away either What Dalinar thought Regardless Danlan continued I have some questions for you I need you to describe for me again what happened when you met that first Parshendi patrol seven years ago Dalinar frowned Despite the Plates augmentation his digging had left him feeling tired But he didnt dare sit on one of the rooms chairs while wearing his Plate He took off one of his gauntlets though and ran his hand through his hair He wasnt fond of this topic but part of him was glad of the distraction A reason to hold off on making a decision that would change his life forever Danlan looked at him prepared to dictate his words Why did Jasnah want this story again Hadnt she written an account of these very events in her biography of her father Well she would eventually tell him why andif her past revelations were any indicationher current project would be of great worth He wished Elhokar had received a measure of his sisters wisdom These are painful memories Jasnah I wish Id never convinced your father to go on that expedition If wed never discovered the Parshendi then they couldnt have assassinated him The first meeting happened when we were exploring a forest that wasnt on the maps This was south of the Shattered Plains in a valley about two weeks march from the Drying Sea During Gavilars youth only two things had thrilled himconquest and hunting When he hadnt been seeking one it had been the other Suggesting the hunt had seemed rational at the time Gavilar had been acting oddly losing his thirst for battle Men had started to say that he was weak Dalinar had wanted to remind his brother of the good times in their youth Hence the hunt for a legendary chasmfiend Your father wasnt with me when I ran across them Dalinar continued thinking back Camping on humid forested hills Interrogating Natan natives via translators Looking for scat or broken trees I was leading scouts up a tributary of the Deathbend River while your father scouted downstream We found the Parshendi camped on the other side I didnt believe it at first Parshmen Camped free and organized And they carried weapons Not crude ones either Swords spears with carved hafts He trailed off Gavilar hadnt believed either when Dalinar told him There was no such thing as a free parshman tribe They were servants and always had been servants Did they have Shardblades then Danlan said Dalinar hadnt realized that Jasnah had made a response No A scratched reply eventually came But they have them now When did you first see a Parshendi Shardbearer After Gavilars death Dalinar said He made the connection Theyd always wondered why Gavilar had wanted a treaty with the Parshendi They wouldnt have needed one just to harvest the greatshells on the Shattered Plains the Parshendi hadnt lived on the Plains then Dalinar felt a chill Could his brother have known that these Parshendi had access to Shardblades Had he made the treaty hoping to get out of them where theyd found the weapons Is it his death Dalinar wondered Is that the secret Jasnahs looking for Shed never shown Elhokars dedication to vengeance but she thought differently from her brother Revenge wouldnt drive her But questions Yes questions would One more thing Uncle Danlan read Then I can go back to digging through this labyrinth of a library At times I feel like a cairn robber sifting through the bones of those long dead Regardless The Parshendi you once mentioned how quickly they seemed to learn our language Yes Dalinar said In a matter of days we were speaking and communicating quite well Remarkable Who would have thought that parshmen of all people had the wit for such a marvel Most hed known didnt do much speaking at all What were the first things they spoke to you about Danlan said The very first questions they asked Can you remember Dalinar closed his eyes remembering days with the Parshendi camped just across the river from them Gavilar had become fascinated by them They wanted to see our maps Did they mention the Voidbringers Voidbringers Not that I recall Why Id rather not say right now However I want to show you something Have your scribe get out a new sheet of paper Danlan affixed a new page to the writing board She put the pen to the corner and let go It rose and began to scratch back and forth in quick bold strokes It was a drawing Dalinar stood up and stepped closer and Adolin crowded near Reed and ink wasnt the best medium and drawing across spans wasnt precise The pen leaked tiny globs of ink in places it wouldnt have on the other side and though the inkwell was in the exact same placeallowing Jasnah to reink both her reed and Dalinars at the same timehis reed sometimes ran out before the one on the other side Still the picture was marvelous This isnt Jasnah Dalinar realized Whoever was doing the drawing was far far more talented than his niece The picture resolved into a depiction of a tall shadow looming over some buildings Hints of carapace and claws showed in the thin ink lines and shadows were made by drawing finer lines close together Danlan set it aside getting out a third sheet of paper Dalinar held the drawing up Adolin at his side The nightmarish beast in the lines and shadows was faintly familiar Like Its a chasmfiend Adolin said pointing Its distortedfar more menacing in the face and larger at the shoulders and I dont see its second set of foreclawsbut someone was obviously trying to draw one of them Yes Dalinar said rubbing his chin This is a depiction from one of the books here Danlan read My new ward is quite skilled at drawing and so I had her reproduce it for you Tell me Does it remind you of anything A new ward Dalinar thought It had been years since Jasnah had taken one She always said she didnt have the time This pictures of a chasmfiend Dalinar said Danlan wrote the words A moment later the reply came The book describes this as a picture of a Voidbringer Danlan frowned cocking her head The book is a copy of a text originally written in the years before the Recreance However the illustrations are copied from another text even older In fact some think that picture was drawn only two or three generations after the Heralds departed Adolin whistled softly That would make it very old indeed So far as Dalinar understood they had few pieces of art or writing dating from the shadowdays The Way of Kings being one of the oldest and the only complete text And even it had survived only in translation they had no copies in the original tongue Before you jump to conclusions Danlan read Im not implying that the Voidbringers were the same thing as chasmfiends I believe that the ancient artist didnt know what a Voidbringer looked like and so she drew the most horrific thing she knew of But how did the original artist know what a chasmfiend looked like Dalinar thought We only just discovered the Shattered Plains But of course Though the Unclaimed Hills were now empty they had once been an inhabited kingdom Someone in the past had known about chasmfiends known them well enough to draw one and label it a Voidbringer I must go now Jasnah said via Danlan Care for my brother in my absence Uncle Jasnah Dalinar sent choosing his words very carefully Things are difficult here The storm begins to blow unchecked and the building shakes and moans You may soon hear news that shocks you It would be very nice if you could return and lend your aid He waited quietly for the reply the spanreed scratching I should like to promise a date when I will come Dalinar could almost hear Jasnahs calm cool voice But I can not estimate when my research will be completed This is very important Jasnah Dalinar said Please reconsider Be assured Uncle that I am coming Eventually I just cant say when Dalinar sighed Note Jasnah wrote that I am most eager to see a chasmfiend for myself A dead one Dalinar said I have no intention of letting you repeat your brothers experience of a few weeks ago Ah Jasnah sent back dear overprotective Dalinar One of these years you will have to admit that your favored niece and nephew have grown up Ill treat you as adults so long as you act the part Dalinar said Come speedily and well get you a dead chasmfiend Take care They waited to see if a further response came but the gem stopped blinking Jasnahs transmission complete Danlan put away the spanreed and the board and Dalinar thanked the clerks for their aid They withdrew Adolin looked as if he wanted to linger but Dalinar gestured for him to leave Dalinar looked down at the picture of the chasmfiend again unsatisfied What had he gained from the conversation More vague hints What could be so important about Jasnahs research that she would ignore threats to the kingdom He would have to compose a more forthright letter to her once hed made his announcement explaining why he had decided to step down Perhaps that would bring her back And in a moment of shock Dalinar realized that he had made his decision Sometime between leaving the trench and now hed stopped treating his abdication as an if and started thinking of it as a when It was the right decision He felt sick about it but certain A man sometimes needed to do things that were unpleasant It was the discussion with Jasnah he realized The talk of her father He was acting like Gavilar at the end That had nearly undermined the kingdom Well he needed to stop himself before he got that far Perhaps whatever was happening to him was some kind of disease of the mind inherited from their parents It You are quite fond of Jasnah Navani said Dalinar started turning away from the picture of the chasmfiend Hed assumed shed followed Adolin out But she still stood there looking at him Why is it Navani said that you encourage her so strongly to return He turned to face Navani and realized that shed sent her two youthful attendants out with the clerks They were now alone Navani he said This is inappropriate Bah Were family and I have questions Dalinar hesitated then walked to the center of the room Navani stood near the door Blessedly her attendants had left open the door at the end of the antechamber and beyond it were two guards in the hall outside It wasnt an ideal situation but so long as Dalinar could see the guards and they him his conversation with Navani was just barely proper Dalinar Navani asked Are you going to answer me Why is it you trust my daughter so much when others almost universally revile her I consider their disdain for her to be a recommendation he said She is a heretic She refused to join any of the devotaries because she did not believe in their teachings Rather than compromise for the sake of appearances she has been honest and has refused to make professions she does not believe I find that a sign of honor Navani snorted You two are a pair of nails in the same doorframe Stern hard and storming annoying to pull free You should go now Dalinar said nodding toward the hallway He suddenly felt very exhausted People will talk Let them We need to plan Dalinar You are the most important highprince in Navani he cut in Im going to abdicate in favor of Adolin She blinked in surprise Im stepping down as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements It will be a few days at most Speaking the words felt odd as if saying them made his decision real Navani looked pained Oh Dalinar she whispered This is a terrible mistake It is mine to make And I must repeat my request I have many things to think about Navani and I cant deal with you right now He pointed at the doorway Navani rolled her eyes but left as requested She shut the door behind her Thats it Dalinar thought letting out a long exhalation Ive made the decision Too weary to remove his Plate unassisted he sank down onto the floor resting his head back against the wall He would tell Adolin of his decision in the morning then announce it at a feast within the week From there he would return to Alethkar and his lands It was over THE END OF Part Two Rysn hesitantly stepped down from the caravans lead wagon Her feet fell on soft uneven ground that sank down a little beneath her That made her shiver particularly since the toothick grass didnt move away as it should Rysn tapped her foot a few times The grass didnt so much as quiver Its not going to move Vstim said Grass here doesnt behave the way it does elsewhere Surely youve heard that The older man sat beneath the bright yellow canopy of the lead wagon He rested one arm on the side rail holding a set of ledgers with the other hand One of his long white eyebrows was tucked behind his ear and he let the other trail down beside his face He preferred stiffly starched robesblue and redand a flattopped conical hat It was classic Thaylen merchants clothing several decades out of date yet still distinguished Ive heard of the grass Rysn said to him But its just so odd She stepped again walking in a circle around the lead wagon Yes shed heard of the grass here in Shinovar but shed assumed that it would just be lethargic That people said it didnt disappear because it moved too slowly But no that wasnt it It didnt move at all How did it survive Shouldnt it have all been eaten away by animals She shook her head in wonder looking up across the plain The grass completely covered it The blades were all crowded together and you couldnt see the ground What a mess it was The ground is springy she said rounding back to her original side of the wagon Not just because of the grass Hmm Vstim said still working on his ledgers Yes Its called soil It makes me feel like Im going to sink down to my knees How can the Shin stand living here Theyre an interesting people Shouldnt you be setting up the device Rysn sighed but walked to the rear of the wagon The other wagons in the caravansix in allwere pulling up and forming a loose circle She took down the tailgate of the lead wagon and heaved pulling out a wooden tripod nearly as tall as she was She carried it over one shoulder marching to the center of the grassy circle She was more fashionable than her babsk she wore the most modern of clothing for a young woman her age a deep blue patterned silk vest over a light green longsleeved shirt with stiff cuffs Her anklelength skirtalso greenwas stiff and businesslike utilitarian in cut but embroidered for fashion She wore a green glove on her left hand Covering the safehand was a silly tradition just a result of Vorin cultural dominance But it was best to keep up appearances Many of the more traditional Thaylen peopleincluding unfortunately her babskstill found it scandalous for a woman to go about with her safehand uncovered She set up the tripod It had been five months since Vstim become her babsk and she his apprentice Hed been good to her Not all babsk were by tradition he was more than just her master He was her father legally until he pronounced her ready to become a merchant on her own She did wish he wouldnt spend so much time traveling to such odd places He was known as a great merchant and shed assumed that great merchants would be the ones visiting exotic cities and ports Not ones who traveled to empty meadows in backward countries Tripod set up she returned to the wagon to fetch the fabrial The wagon back formed an enclosure with thick sides and top to offer protection against highstormseven the weaker ones in the West could be dangerous at least until one got through the passes and into Shinovar She hurried back to the tripod with the fabrials box She slid off the wooden top and removed the large heliodor inside The pale yellow gemstone at least two inches in diameter was fixed inside a metal framework It glowed gently not as bright as one might expect of such a sizable gem She set it in the tripod then spun a few of the dials underneath setting the fabrial to the people in the caravan Then she pulled a stool from the wagon and sat down to watch Shed been astonished at what Vstim had paid for the deviceone of the new recently invented types that would give warning if people approached Was it really so important She sat back looking up at the gemstone watching to see if it grew brighter The odd grass of the Shin lands waved in the wind stubbornly refusing to withdraw even at the strongest of gusts In the distance rose the white peaks of the Misted Mountains sheltering Shinovar Those mountains caused the highstorms to break and fade making Shinovar one of the only places in all of Roshar where highstorms did not reign The plain around her was dotted with strange straighttrunked trees with stiff skeletal branches full of leaves that didnt withdraw in the wind The entire landscape had an eerie feel to it as if it were dead Nothing moved With a start Rysn realized she couldnt see any spren Not a one No windspren no lifespren nothing It was as if the entire land were slow of wit Like a man who was born without all his brains one who didnt know when to protect himself but instead just stared at the wall drooling She dug into the ground with a finger then brought it up to inspect the soil as Vstim had called it It was dirty stuff Why a strong gust could uproot this entire field of grass and blow it away Good thing the highstorms couldnt reach these lands Near the wagons the servants and guards unloaded crates and set up camp Suddenly the heliodor began to pulse with a brighter yellow light Master she called standing Someones nearby Vstimwho had been going through crateslooked up sharply He waved to Kylrm head of the guards and his six men got out their bows There one said pointing In the distance a group of horsemen was approaching They didnt ride very quickly and they led several large animalslike thick squat horsespulling wagons The gemstone in the fabrial pulsed more brightly as the newcomers got closer Yes Vstim said looking at the fabrial That is going to be very handy Good range on it But we knew they were coming Rysn said rising from her stool and walking over to him This time he said But if it warns us of bandits in the dark itll repay its cost a dozen times over Kylrm lower your bows You know how they feel about those things The guards did as they were told and the group of Thaylens waited Rysn found herself tucking her eyebrows back nervously though she didnt know why she bothered The newcomers were just Shin Of course Vstim insisted that she shouldnt think of them as savages He seemed to have great respect for them As they approached she was surprised by the variety in their appearance Other Shin shed seen had worn basic brown robes or other workers clothing At the front of this group however was a man in what must be Shin finery a bright multicolored cloak that completely enveloped him tied closed at the front It trailed down on either side of his horse drooping almost to the ground Only his head was exposed Four men rode on horses around him and they wore more subdued clothing Still bright just not as bright They wore shirts trousers and colorful capes At least three dozen other men walked alongside them wearing brown tunics More drove the three large wagons Wow Rysn said He brought a lot of servants Servants Vstim said The fellows in brown Her babsk smiled Those are his guards child What They look so dull Shin are a curious folk he said Here warriors are the lowliest of menkind of like slaves Men trade and sell them between houses by way of little stones that signify ownership and any man who picks up a weapon must join them and be treated the same The fellow in the fancy robe Hes a farmer A landowner you mean No As far as I can tell he goes out every daywell the days when hes not overseeing a negotiation like thisand works the fields They treat all farmers like that lavish them with attention and respect Rysn gaped But most villages are filled with farmers Indeed Vstim said Holy places here Foreigners arent allowed near fields or farming villages How strange she thought Perhaps living in this place has affected their minds Kylrm and his guards didnt look terribly pleased at being so heavily outnumbered but Vstim didnt seem bothered Once the Shin grew close he walked out from his wagons without a hint of trepidation Rysn hurried after him her skirt brushing the grass below Bother she thought Another problem with its not retracting If she had to buy a new hem because of this dull grass it was going to make her very cross Vstim met up with the Shin then bowed in a distinctive way hands toward the ground Tan balo ken tala he said She didnt know what it meant The man in the cloakthe farmernodded respectfully and one of the other riders dismounted and walked forward Winds of Fortune guide you my friend He spoke Thaylen very well He who adds is happy for your safe arrival Thank you ThreshsonEsan Vstim said And my thanks to he who adds What have you brought for us from your strange lands friend Thresh said More metal I hope Vstim waved and some of the guards brought over a heavy crate They set it down and pried off the top revealing its peculiar contents Pieces of scrap metal mostly shaped like bits of shell though some were formed like pieces of wood It looked to Rysn like garbage that hadfor some inexplicable reasonbeen Soulcast into metal Ah Thresh said squatting down to inspect the box Wonderful Not a bit of it was mined Vstim said No rocks were broken or smelted to get this metal Thresh It was Soulcast from shells bark or branches I have a document sealed by five separate Thaylen notaries attesting to it You neednt have done such a thing as this Thresh said You have once earned our trust in this matter long ago Id rather be proper about it Vstim said A merchant who is careless with contracts is one who finds himself with enemies instead of friends Thresh stood up clapping three times The men in brown with the downcast eyes lowered the back of a wagon revealing crates The others who visit us Thresh noted walking to the wagon All they seem to care about are horses Everyone wishes to buy horses But never you my friend Why is that Too hard to care for Vstim said walking with Thresh And theres too often a poor return on the investment valuable as they are But not with these Thresh said picking up one of the light crates There was something alive inside Not at all Vstim said Chickens fetch a good price and theyre easy to care for assuming you have feed We brought you plenty Thresh said I can not believe you buy these from us They are not worth nearly so much as you outsiders think And you give us metal for them Metal that bears no stain of broken rock A miracle Vstim shrugged Those scraps are practically worthless where I come from Theyre made by ardents practicing with Soulcasters They cant make food because if you get it wrong its poisonous So they turn garbage into metal and throw it away But it can be forged Why forge the metal Vstim said when you can carve an object from wood in the precise shape you want then Soulcast it Thresh just shook his head bemused Rysn watched with her own share of confusion This was the craziest trade exchange shed ever seen Normally Vstim argued and haggled like a crushkiller But here he freely revealed that his wares were worthless In fact as conversation proceeded the two both took pains to explain how worthless their goods were Eventually they came to an agreementthough Rysn couldnt grasp howand shook hands on the deal Some of Threshs soldiers began to unload their boxes of chickens cloth and exotic dried meats Others began carting away boxes of scrap metal You couldnt trade me a soldier could you Vstim asked as they waited They can not be sold to an outsider I am afraid But there was that one you traded me Its been nearly seven years Thresh said with a laugh And still you ask You dont know what I got for him Vstim said And you gave him to me for practically nothing He was Truthless Thresh said shrugging He wasnt worth anything at all You forced me to take something in trade though to confess I had to throw your payment into a river I could not take money for a Truthless Well I suppose I cant take offense at that Vstim said rubbing his chin But if you ever have another let me know Best servant I ever had I still regret that I traded him I will remember friend Thresh said But I do not think it likely we will have another like him He seemed to grow distracted Indeed I should hope that we never do Once the goods were exchanged they shook hands again then Vstim bowed to the farmer Rysn tried to mimic what he did and earned a smile from Thresh and several of his companions who chattered in their whispering Shin language Such a long boring ride for such a short exchange But Vstim was right those chickens would be worth good spheres in the East What did you learn Vstim said to her as they walked back toward the lead wagon That Shin are odd No Vstim said though he wasnt stern He never seemed to be stern They are simply different child Odd people are those who act erratically Thresh and his kind they are anything but erratic They may be a little too stable The world is changing outside but the Shin seem determined to remain the same Ive tried to offer them fabrials but they find them worthless Or unholy Or too holy to use Those are rather different things master Yes he said But with the Shin its often hard to distinguish among them Regardless what did you really learn That they treat being humble like the Herdazians treat boasting she said You both went out of your way to show how worthless your wares were I found it strange but I think it might just be how they haggle He smiled widely And already you are wiser than half the men Ive brought here Listen Here is your lesson Never try to cheat the Shin Be forthright tell them the truth andif anythingundervalue your goods They will love you for it And theyll pay you for it too She nodded They reached the wagon and he got out a strange little pot Here he said Use a knife and go cut out some of that grass Be sure to cut down far and get plenty of the soil The plants cant live without it Why am I doing this she asked wrinkling her nose and taking the pot Because he said Youre going to learn to care for that plant I want you to keep it with you until you stop thinking of it as odd But why Because it will make you a better merchant he said She frowned Must he be so strange so much of the time Perhaps that was why he was one of the only Thaylens who could get a good deal out of the Shin He was as odd as they were She walked off to do as she was told No use complaining She did get out a rugged pair of gloves first though and roll up her sleeves She was not going to ruin a good dress for a pot of drooling wallstaring imbecile grass And that was that Axies the Collector groaned lying on his back skull pounding with a headache He opened his eyes and looked down the length of his body He was naked Blight it all he thought Well best to check and see if he was hurt too badly His toes pointed at the sky The nails were a deep blue color not uncommon for an Aimian man like himself He tried to wiggle them and pleasingly they actually moved Well thats something he said dropping his head back to the ground It made a squishing sound as it touched something soft likely a bit of rotting garbage Yes that was what it was He could smell it now pungent and rank He focused on his nose sculpting his body so that he could no longer smell Ah he thought Much better Now if he could only banish the pounding in his head Really did the sun have to be so garish overhead He closed his eyes Youre still in my alley a gruff voice said from behind him That voice had awakened him in the first place I shall vacate it presently Axies promised You owe me rent One nights sleep In an alleyway Finest alleyway in Kasitor Ah Is that where I am then Excellent A few heartbeats of mental focus finally banished the headache He opened his eyes and this time found the sunlight quite pleasant Brick walls rose toward the sky on either side of him overgrown with a crusty red lichen Small heaps of rotting tubers were scattered around him No Not scattered They looked to be arranged carefully Odd that They were likely the source of the scents hed noticed earlier Best to leave his sense of smell inhibited He sat up stretching checking his muscles All seemed to be in working order though he had quite a few bruises Hed deal with those in a bit Now he said turning you wouldnt happen to have a spare pair of pants would you The own er of the voice turned out to be a scragglybearded man sitting on a box at the end of the alleyway Axies didnt recognize him nor did he recognize the location That wasnt surprising considering that hed been beaten robbed and left for dead Again The things I do in the name of scholarship he thought with a sigh His memory was returning Kasitor was a large Iriali city second in size only to Rall Elorim Hed come here by design Hed also gotten himself drunk by design Perhaps he should have picked his drinking companions more carefully Im going to guess that you dont have a spare pair of pants Axies said standing and inspecting the tattoos on his arm And if you did Id suggest that you wear them yourself Is that a lavis sack you have on You owe me rent the man grumbled And payment for destroying the temple of the northern god Odd Axies said looking over his shoulder toward the alleyways opening There was a busy street beyond The good people of Kasitor would likely not take well to his nudity I dont recall destroying any temples Normally Im quite cognizant of that sort of thing You took out half of Hapron Street the beggar said Number of homes as well Ill let that slide Mighty kind of you Theyve been wicked lately Axies frowned looking back at the beggar He followed the mans gaze looking down at the ground The heaps of rotting vegetables had been placed in a very particular arrangement Like a city Ah Axies said moving his foot which had been planted on a small square of vegetable That was a bakery the beggar said Terribly sorry The family was away Thats a relief They were worshipping at the temple The one I Smashed with your head Yes Im certain youll be kind to their souls The beggar narrowed his eyes at him Im still trying to decide how you fit into things Are you a Voidbringer or a Herald Voidbringer Im afraid Axies said I mean I did destroy a temple The beggars eyes grew more suspicious Only the sacred cloth can banish me Axies continued And since you dontI say what is that youre holding The beggar looked down at his hand which was touching one of the ratty blankets draped over one of his equally ratty boxes He perched atop them likewell like a god looking down over his people Poor fool Axies thought It was really time to be moving on Wouldnt want to bring any bad luck down upon the addled fellow The beggar held up the blanket Axies shied back raising his hands That made the beggar smile a grin that could have used a few more teeth He hopped off his box holding the blanket up wardingly Axies shied away The beggar cackled and threw the blanket at him Axies snatched it from the air and shook a fist at the beggar Then he retreated from the alleyway while wrapping the blanket around his waist And lo the beggar said from behind the foul beast was banished And lo Axies said fixing the blanket in place the foul beast avoided imprisonment for public indecency Iriali were very particular about their chastity laws They were very particular about a lot of things Of course that could be said for most peoplesthe only difference were the things they were particular about Axies the Collector drew his share of stares Not because of his unconventional clothingIri was on the northwestern rim of Roshar and its weather therefore tended to be much warmer than that of places like Alethkar or even Azir A fair number of the goldenhaired Iriali men went about wearing only waist wraps their skin painted various colors and patterns Even Axiess tattoos werent that noteworthy here Perhaps he drew stares because of his blue nails and crystalline deep blue eyes Aimianseven Siah Aimianswere rare Or perhaps it was because he cast a shadow the wrong way Toward light instead of away from it It was a small thing and the shadows werent long with the sun so high But those who noticed muttered or jumped out of the way Likely theyd heard of his kind It hadnt been that long since the scouring of his homeland Just long ago enough for stories and legends to have crept into the general knowledge of most peoples Perhaps someone important would take exception to him and have him brought before a local magistrate Wouldnt be the first time Hed learned long ago not to worry When the Curse of Kind followed you you learned to take what happened as it happened He began to whistle softly to himself inspecting his tattoos and ignoring those observant enough to gawk I remember writing something somewhere he thought looking over his wrist then twisting his arm over and trying to see if there were any new tattoos on the back Like all Aimians he could change the color and markings of his skin at will That was convenient as when you were very regularly robbed of everything you owned it was blighted difficult to keep a proper notebook And so he kept his notes on his skin at least until he could return to a safe location and transcribe them Hopefully he hadnt gotten so drunk that hed written his observations someplace inconvenient Hed done that once and reading the mess had required two mirrors and a very confused bathing attendant Ah he thought discovering a new entry near the inside of his left elbow He read it awkwardly shuffling down the incline Test successful Have noted spren who appear only when one is severely intoxicated Appear as small brown bubbles clinging to objects nearby Further testing may be needed to prove they were more than a drunken hallucination Very nice he said out loud Very nice indeed I wonder what I should call them The stories hed heard called them sudspren but that seemed silly Intoxicationspren No too unwieldy Alespren He felt a surge of excitement Hed been hunting this particular type of spren for years If they proved real it would be quite a victory Why did they appear only in Iri And why so infrequently Hed gotten himself stupidly drunk a dozen times and had only found them once If indeed he had ever really found them Spren however could be very elusive Sometimes even the most common typesflamespren for instancewould refuse to appear That made it particularly frustrating for a man who had made it his lifes work to observe catalogue and study every single type of spren in Roshar He continued whistling as he made his way through the town to the dockside Around him flowed large numbers of the goldenhaired Iriali The hair bred true like black Alethi hairthe purer your blood was the more locks of gold you had And it wasnt merely blond it was truly gold lustrous in the sun He had a fondness for the Iriali They werent nearly as prudish as the Vorin peoples to the east and were rarely inclined to bickering or fighting That made it easier to hunt spren Of course there were also spren you could find only during war A group of people had gathered at the docks Ah he thought excellent Im not too late Most were crowding onto a purposebuilt viewing platform Axies found himself a place to stand adjusted his holy blanket and leaned back against the railing to wait It wasnt long At precisely seven fortysix in the morningthe locals could use it to set their timepiecesan enormous seablue spren surged from the waters of the bay It was translucent and though it appeared to throw out waves as it rose that was illusory The actual surface of the bay wasnt disturbed It takes the shape of a large jet of water Axies thought creating a tattoo along an open portion of his leg scribing the words The center is of the deepest blue like the ocean depths though the outer edges are a lighter shade Judging by the masts of the nearby ships Id say that the spren has grown to a height of at least a hundred feet One of the largest Ive ever seen The column sprouted four long arms that came down around the bay forming fingers and thumbs They landed on golden pedestals that had been placed there by the people of the city The spren came at the same time every day without fail They called it by name Cusicesh the Protector Some worshipped it as a god Most simply accepted it as part of the city It was unique One of the few types of spren he knew of that seemed to have only a single member But what kind of spren is it Axies wrote fascinated It has formed a face looking eastward Directly toward the Origin That face is shifting bewilderingly quick Different human faces appear on the end of its stumplike neck one after another in blurred succession The display lasted a full ten minutes Did any of the faces repeat They changed so quickly he couldnt tell Some seemed male others female Once the display was finished Cusicesh retreated down into the bay sending up phantom waves again Axies felt drained as if something had been leeched from him That was reported to be a common reaction Was he imagining it because it was expected Or was it real As he considered a street urchin scrambled past and grabbed his wrap yanking it free and laughing to himself He tossed it to some friends and they scrambled away Axies shook his head What a bother he said as people around him began to gasp and mutter There are guards nearby I assume Ah yes Four of them Wonderful The four were already stalking toward him golden hair falling around their shoulders expressions stern Well he said to himself making a final notation as one of the guards grabbed him on the shoulder It appears Ill have another chance to search for captivityspren Odd how those had eluded him all these years despite his numerous incarcerations He was beginning to consider them mythological The guards towed him off toward the city dungeons but he didnt mind Two new spren in as many days At this rate it might only take a few more centuries to complete his research Grand indeed He resumed whistling to himself SzethsonsonVallano Truthless of Shinovar crouched on a high stone ledge at the side of the gambling den The ledge was meant for holding a lantern both his legs and the shelf were hidden by his long enveloping cloak making him seem to be hanging from the wall There were few lights nearby Makkek liked Szeth to remain cloaked in shadow He wore a formfitting black costume beneath the cloak the lower part of his face covered by a cloth mask both were of Makkeks design The cloak was too big and the clothing too tight It was a terrible outfit for an assassin but Makkek demanded drama and Szeth did as his master commanded Always Perhaps there was something useful to the drama With only his eyes and bald head showing he unnerved the people who passed by Shin eyes too round slightly too large The people here thought them similar to the eyes of a child Why did that disturb them so Nearby a group of men in brown cloaks sat chatting and rubbing their thumbs and forefingers together Wisps of smoke rose between their fingers accompanied by a faint crackling sound Rubbing firemoss was said to make a mans mind more receptive to thoughts and ideas The one time Szeth had tried it it had given him a headache and two blistered fingers But once you grew the calluses it could apparently be euphoric The circular den had a bar at the center serving a wide variety of drinks at a wider variety of prices The barmaids were dressed in violet robes that had plunging necklines and were open at the sides Their safehands were exposed something that the Bavlanderswho were Vorin by descentseemed to find extremely provocative So odd It was just a hand Around the perimeter of the den various games were in progress None of them were overt games of chanceno dice throws no bets on card flips There were games of breakneck shallowcrab fights andoddlyguessing games That was another oddity about Vorin peoples they avoided overtly guessing the future A game like breakneck would have throws and tosses but they wouldnt bet on the outcome Instead theyd bet on the hand they held after the throws and the draws It seemed a meaningless distinction to Szeth but it was deeply steeped in the culture Even here in one of the vilest pits in the citywhere women walked with their hands exposed and men spoke openly of crimesnobody risked offending the Heralds by seeking to know the future Even predicting the highstorms made many uncomfortable And yet they thought nothing of walking on stone or using Stormlight for everyday illumination They ignored the spirits of things that lived around them and they ate whatever they wanted on any day they wanted Strange So strange And yet this was his life Recently Szeth had begun to question some of the prohibitions he had once followed so strictly How could these Easterners not walk on stone There was no soil in their lands How could they get about without treading on stone Dangerous thoughts His way of life was all that remained to him If he questioned Stone Shamanism would he then question his nature as Truthless Dangerous dangerous Though his murders and sins would damn him at least his soul would be given to the stones upon his death He would continue to exist Punished in agony but not exiled to nothingness Better to exist in agony than to vanish entirely Makkek himself strode the floor of the gambling den a woman on each arm His scrawny leanness was gone his face having slowly gained a juicy plumpness like a fruit ripening after the drownings waters Also gone were his ragged footpads garments replaced with luxurious silks Makkeks companionsthe ones with him when theyd killed Tookwere all dead murdered by Szeth at Makkeks orders All to hide the secret of the Oathstone Why were these Easterners always so ashamed of the way they controlled Szeth Was it because they feared another would steal the Oathstone from them Were they terrified that the weapon they employed so callously would be turned against them Perhaps he feared that if it were known how easily Szeth was controlled it would spoil their reputation Szeth had overheard more than one conversation centered around the mystery of Makkeks terribly effective bodyguard If a creature like Szeth served Makkek then the master himself must be even more dangerous Makkek passed the place where Szeth lurked one of the women on his arms laughing with tinkling sound Makkek glanced at Szeth then gestured curtly Szeth bowed his masked head in acknowledgment He slid from his place dropping to the ground oversized cloak fluttering Games stilled Men both drunken and sober turned to watch Szeth and as he passed the three men with the firemoss their fingers went limp Most in the room knew what Szeth was about this night A man had moved into Bornwater and opened his own gambling den to challenge Makkek Likely this newcomer didnt believe the reputation of Makkeks phantom assassin Well he had reason to be skeptical Szeths reputation was inaccurate He was far far more dangerous than it suggested He ducked out of the gambling den passing up the steps through the darkened storefront and then out into the yard He tossed the cloak and face mask into a wagon as he passed The cloak would only make noise and why cover his face He was the only Shin in town If someone saw his eyes theyd know who he was He retained the tight black clothing changing would take too much time Bornwater was the largest town in the area it hadnt taken Makkek long to outgrow Staplind Now he was talking of moving up to Kneespike the city where the local landlord had his mansion If that happened Szeth would spend months wading in blood as he systematically tracked down and killed each and every thief cutthroat and gambling master who refused Makkeks rule That was months off For now there was Bornwaters interloper a man named Gavashaw Szeth prowled through the streets eschewing Stormlight or Shardblade counting on his natural grace and care to keep him unseen He enjoyed his brief freedom These momentswhen he wasnt trapped in one of Makkeks smokefilled denswere too few lately Slipping between buildingsmoving swiftly in the darkness with the wet cold air on his skinhe could almost think himself back in Shinovar The buildings around him were not of blasphemous stone but earthen ones built with clay and soil Those low sounds were not muffled cheers from within another of Makkeks gambling dens but the thunder and whinnies of wild horses on the plains But no In Shinovar hed never smelled refuse like thatpungency compounded by weeks spent marinating He was not home There was no place for him in the Valley of Truth Szeth entered one of the richer sections of town where buildings had more space between homes Bornwater was in a lait protected by a towering cliffside to the east Gavashaw had arrogantly made his home in a large mansion on the eastern side of town It belonged to the provincial landlord Gavashaw had his favor The landlord had heard of Makkek and his quick rise to prominence in the underground and supporting a rival was a good way to create an early check on Makkeks power The citylords local mansion was three stories tall with a stone wall surrounding the compact neatly gardened grounds Szeth approached in a low crouch Here on the outskirts of town the ground was spotted with bulbous rockbuds As he passed the plants rustled pulling back their vines and lethargically closing their shells He reached the wall and pressed himself against it It was the time between the first two moons the darkest period of night The hateful hour his people called it for it was one of the only times when the gods did not watch men Soldiers walked the wall above feet scraping the stones Gavashaw probably thought himself safe in this building which was secure enough for a powerful lighteyes Szeth breathed in infusing himself with Stormlight from the spheres in his pouch He began to glow luminescent vapors rising from his skin In the darkness it was quite noticeable These powers had never been intended for assassination Surgebinders had fought during the light of day battling the night but not embracing it That was not Szeths place He would simply have to take extra care not to be seen Ten heartbeats after the passing of the guards Szeth Lashed himself to the wall That direction became down for him and he was able to run up the side of the stone fortification As he reached the top he leaped forward then briefly Lashed himself backward He spun over the top of the wall in a tucked flip then Lashed himself back to the wall again He came down with feet planted on the stones facing the ground He ran and Lashed himself downward again dropping the last few feet The grounds were laced with shalebark mounds cultivated to form small terraces Szeth ducked low picking his way through the mazelike garden There were guards at the buildings doorways watching by the light of spheres How easy it would be to dash up consume the Stormlight and plunge the men into darkness before cutting them down But Makkek had not expressly commanded him to be so destructive Gavashaw was to be assassinated but the method was up to Szeth He picked one that would not require killing the guards That was what he always did when given the chance It was the only way to preserve what little humanity he had left He reached the western wall of the mansion and Lashed himself to it then ran up it onto the roof It was long and flat sloped gently eastwardan unnecessary feature in a lait but Easterners saw the world by the light of the highstorms Szeth quickly crossed to the rear of the building to where a small rock dome covered a lower portion of the mansion He dropped down onto the dome Stormlight streaming from his body Translucent luminescent pristine Like the ghost of a fire burning from him consuming his soul He summoned his Shardblade in the stillness and dark then used it to slice a hole in the dome angling his Blade so that the chunk of rock did not fall down inside He reached down with his free hand and infused the stone circle with Light Lashing it toward the northwest section of the sky Lashing something to a distant point like that was possible but imprecise It was like trying to shoot an arrow a great distance He stepped back as the stone circle lurched free and fell up into the air streaming Stormlight as it soared toward the splattered paint drops of stars above Szeth leapt into the hole then immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling He twisted in the air landing with his feet planted on the underside of the dome beside the lip of the hole hed cut From his perspective he was now standing at the bottom of a gigantic stone bowl the hole cut in the very bottom looking out on the stars beneath He walked up the side of the bowl Lashing himself to the right In seconds he was on the floor reoriented so that the dome rose above him Distantly he heard a faint crashing The chunk of stone Stormlight exhausted had fallen back to the ground He had aimed it out of the town Hopefully it had not caused any accidental deaths The guards would now be distracted searching for the source of the distant crash Szeth breathed in deeply draining his second pouch of gemstones The light streaming from him became brighter letting him see the room around him As hed suspected it was empty This was a rarely used feasting hall with cold firepits tables and benches The air was still silent and musty Like that of a tomb Szeth hurried to the door slid his Shardblade between it and the frame and sliced through the deadbolt He eased the door open The Stormlight rising from his body illuminated the dark hallway outside Early during his time with Makkek Szeth had been careful not to use the Shardblade As his tasks had grown more difficult however hed been forced to resort to it to avoid unnecessary killing Now the rumors about him were populated with tales of holes cut through stone and dead men with burned eyes Makkek had begun to believe those rumors He hadnt yet demanded that Szeth relinquish the Bladeif he did so he would discover the second of Szeths two forbidden actions He was required to carry the Blade until his death after which Shin Stone Shamans would recover it from whomever had killed him He moved through the hallways He wasnt worried about Makkek taking the Blade but he was worried about how bold the thief lord was growing The more successful Szeth was the more audacious Makkek became How long before he stopped using Szeth to kill minor rivals instead sending him to kill Shardbearers or powerful lighteyes How long before someone made the connection A Shin assassin with a Shardblade capable of mysterious feats and extreme stealth Could this be the nowinfamous Assassin in White Makkek could draw the Alethi king and highprinces away from their war on the Shattered Plains and bring them crashing down upon Jah Keved Thousands would die Blood would fall like the rain of a highstormthick pervasive destructive He continued down the hallway in a swift low run Shardblade carried in a reverse grip extending out behind him Tonight at least he assassinated a man who deserved his fate Were the hallways too quiet Szeth hadnt seen a soul since leaving the rooftop Could Gavashaw have been foolish enough to place all of his guards outside leaving his bedchamber undefended Ahead the doors into the masters rooms lay unwatched and dark at the end of a short hallway Suspicious Szeth crept up to the doors listening Nothing He hesitated glancing to the side A grand stairway led up to the second floor He hustled over and used his Blade to shear free a wooden knob from the newel post It was about the size of a small melon A few hacks with the Blade cut a cloaksized section of drapery free from a window Szeth hurried back to the doors and infused the wooden sphere with Stormlight giving it a Basic Lashing that pointed it westward directly ahead of him He cut through the latch between the doors and eased one open The room beyond was dark Was Gavashaw gone for the evening Where would he go This city was not safe for him yet Szeth placed the wooden ball in the middle of the drape then held it up and dropped it It fell forward toward the far wall Wrapped in the fabric the ball looked vaguely like a person in a cloak running through the room in a crouch No concealed guards struck at it The decoy bounced off a latched window then came to rest hanging against the wall It continued to leak Stormlight That light illuminated a small table with an object atop it Szeth squinted trying to make out what it was He edged forward slinking into the room closer and closer to the table Yes The object on the table was a head One with Gavashaws features Shadows thrown by Stormlight gave the grisly face an even more haunted cast Someone had beaten Szeth to the assassination SzethsonNeturo a voice said Szeth turned spinning his Shardblade around and falling into a defensive stance A figure stood on the far side of the room shrouded in the darkness Who are you Szeth demanded his Stormlight aura growing brighter once he stopped holding his breath Are you satisfied with this SzethsonNeturo the voice asked It was male and deep What was that accent The man wasnt Veden Alethi perhaps Are you satisfied with trivial crimes Killing over meaningless turf in backwater mining villages Szeth didnt reply He scanned the room looking for motion in the other shadows None seemed to be hiding anyone Ive watched you the voice said Youve been sent to intimidate shopkeepers Youve killed footpads so unimportant even the authorities ignore them Youve been shown off to impress whores as if they were high lighteyed ladies What a waste I do as my master demands You are squandered the voice said You are not meant for petty extortions and murders Using you like this its like hitching a Ryshadium stallion to a rundown market wagon Its like using a Shardblade to slice vegetables or like using the finest parchment as kindling for a washwater fire It is a crime You are a work of art SzethsonNeturo a god And each day Makkek throws dung at you Who are you Szeth repeated An admirer of the arts Do not call me by my fathers name Szeth said He should not be sullied by association with me The sphere on the wall finally ran out of Stormlight dropping to the floor the drapery muffling its fall Very well the figure said But do you not rebel against this frivolous use of your skills Were you not meant for greatness There is no greatness in killing Szeth said You speak like a kukori Great men create food and clothing He who adds is to be revered I am he who takes away At least in the killing of men such as these I can pretend to be doing a service This from the man who nearly toppled one of the greatest kingdoms in Roshar This from the man who committed one of the most heinous slaughters in Roshar Szeth corrected The figure snorted What you did was a mere breeze compared to the storm of slaughter Shardbearers wreak on a battlefield each day And those are breezes compared to the tempests you are capable of Szeth began to walk away Where are you going the figure asked Gavashaw is dead I must return to my master Something hit the floor Szeth spun Shardblade down The figure had dropped something round and heavy It rolled across the floor toward Szeth Another head It came to rest on its side Szeth froze as he made out the features The pudgy cheeks were stained with blood the dead eyes wide with shock Makkek How Szeth demanded We took him seconds after you left the gambling den We Servants of your new master My Oathstone The figure opened his hand revealing a gemstone suspended in his palm by a chain wrapped around his fingers Sitting beside it now illuminated was Szeths Oathstone The figures face was dark he wore a mask Szeth dismissed his Shardblade and went down on one knee What are your orders There is a list on the table the figure said closing his hand and hiding the Oathstone It details our masters wishes Szeth rose and walked over Beside the head which rested on a plate to contain the blood was a sheet of paper He took it and his Stormlight illuminated some two dozen names written in the warriors script of his homeland Some had a note beside them with instructions on how they were to be killed Glories within Szeth thought These are some of the most powerful people in the world Six highprinces A Selay gerontarch The king of Jah Keved It is time you stopped wasting your talent the figure said walking to the far wall resting his hand upon it This will cause chaos Szeth whispered Infighting War Confusion and pain such as the world has rarely known The chained gemstone on the mans palm flashed The wall vanished turned to smoke A Soulcaster The dark figure glanced at Szeth Indeed Our master directs that you are to use tactics similar to those you employed so well in Alethkar years ago When you are done you will receive further instructions He then exited through the opening leaving Szeth horrified This was his nightmare To be in the hands of those who understood his capabilities and who had the ambition to use them properly He stood for a time silent long past when his Stormlight ran out Then reverently he folded the list He was surprised that his hands were so steady He should be trembling For soon the world itself would shake The ones of ash and fire who killed like a swarm relentless before the Heralds Noted in Masly page 337 Corroborated by Coldwin and Hasavah It sounds like youre getting into Jasnahs good graces quickly the spanreed wrote out How long before you can make the switch Shallan grimaced turning the gemstone on the reed I dont know she wrote back Jasnah keeps a close watch on the Soulcaster as youd expect She wears it all day At night she locks it away in her safe and wears the key around her neck She turned the gemstone then waited for a reply She was in her chamber a small stonecarved room inside Jasnahs quarters Her accommodations were austere A small bed a nightstand and the writing table were her only furniture Her clothing remained in the trunk she had brought No rug adorned the floor and there were no windows as the rooms were in the Kharbranthian Conclave which was underground That does make it troubling the reed wrote EylitaNan Balats betrothedwas the one doing the writing but all three of Shallans surviving brothers would be in the room back in Jah Keved contributing to the conversation Im guessing she takes it off while bathing Shallan wrote Once she trusts me more she may begin using me as a bathing attendant That may present an opportunity That is a good plan the spanreed wrote Nan Balat wants me to point out that we are very sorry to make you do this It must be difficult for you to be away so long Difficult Shallan picked up the spanreed and hesitated Yes it was difficult Difficult not to fall in love with the freedom difficult not to get too absorbed in her studies It had been only two months since shed convinced Jasnah to take her as a ward but already she felt half as timid and twice as confident The most difficult thing of all was knowing that it would soon end Coming to study in Kharbranth was without doubt the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to her I will manage she wrote You are the ones living the difficult life maintaining our familys interests at home How are you doing It took time for them to reply Poorly Eylita finally sent Your fathers debts are coming due and Wikim can barely keep the creditors distracted The highprince ails and everyone wants to know where our house stands on the question of succession The last of the quarries is running out If it becomes known that we no longer have resources it will go badly for us Shallan grimaced How long do I have A few more months at best Nan Balat sent back via his betrothed It depends on how long the highprince lasts and whether or not anyone realizes why Asha Jushu is selling our possessions Jushu was the youngest of the brothers just older than Shallan His old gambling habit was actually coming in handy For years hed been stealing things from their father and selling them to cover his losses He pretended he was still doing that but he brought the money back to help He was a good man despite his habit And all things considered he really couldnt be blamed for much of what hed done None of them could Wikim thinks that he can keep everyone at bay for a while longer But we are getting desperate The sooner you return with the Soulcaster the better Shallan hesitated then wrote Are we certain this is the best way Perhaps we should simply ask Jasnah for help You think she would respond to that they wrote back She would help an unknown and disliked Veden house She would keep our secrets Probably not Though Shallan was increasingly certain that Jasnahs reputation was exaggerated the woman did have a ruthless side to her She would not leave her important studies to go help Shallans family She reached for the reed to reply but it started scribbling again Shallan it said This is Nan Balat I have sent the others away It is only Eylita and me writing you now There is something you need to know Luesh is dead Shallan blinked in surprise Luesh her fathers steward had been the one who had known how to use the Soulcaster He was one of the few people she and her brothers had determined they could trust What happened she wrote after switching to a new sheet of paper He died in his sleep and theres no reason to suspect he was killed But Shallan a few weeks after his passing some men visited here claiming to be friends of our father In private with me they implied they knew of Fathers Soulcaster and suggested strongly that I was to return it to them Shallan frowned She still carried her fathers broken Soulcaster in the safepouch of her sleeve Return it she wrote We never did figure out where Father got it Nan Balat sent Shallan he was involved in something Those maps the things Luesh said and now this We continue to pretend that Father is alive and occasionally he gets letters from other lighteyes that speak of vague plans I think he was going to make a play to become highprince And he was supported by some very powerful forces These men who came they were dangerous Shallan The type of men you do not cross And they want their Soulcaster back Whoever they are I suspect they gave it to Father so he could create wealth and make a bid for the succession They know hes dead I believe that if we dont return a working Soulcaster to them we could all be in serious danger You need to bring Jasnahs fabrial to us Well quickly use it to create new quarries of valuable stone and then we can give it up to these men Shallan you must succeed I was hesitant about this plan when you suggested it but other avenues are quickly vanishing Shallan felt a chill She read over the paragraphs a few times then wrote If Luesh is dead then we dont know how to use the Soulcaster That is problematic I know Nan Balat sent See if you can figure that out This is dangerous Shallan I know it is Im sorry She took a deep breath It must be done she wrote Here Nan Balat sent I wanted to show you something Have you ever seen this symbol The sketch that followed was crude Eylita wasnt much of an artist Fortunately it was a simple picturethree diamond shapes in a curious pattern Ive never seen it Shallan wrote Why Luesh wore a pendant with this symbol on it Nan Balat sent We found it on his body And one of the men who came searching for the Soulcaster had the same pattern tattooed on his hand just below his thumb Curious Shallan wrote So Luesh Yes Nan Balat sent Despite what he said I think he must have been the one who brought the Soulcaster to Father Luesh was involved in this perhaps as liaison between Father and the people backing him I tried to suggest that they could back me instead but the men just laughed They did not stay long or give a specific time by which the Soulcaster must be returned I doubt theyd be satisfied to receive a broken one Shallan pursed her lips Balat have you thought that we might be risking a war If it becomes known that weve stolen an Alethi Soulcaster No there wouldnt be a war Nan Balat wrote back King Hanavanar would just turn us over to the Alethi Theyd execute us for the theft Wonderfully comforting Balat she wrote Thank you so much Youre welcome Were going to have to hope that Jasnah doesnt realize that you took the Soulcaster It seems likely shell assume that hers broke for some reason Shallan sighed Perhaps she wrote Take care Nan Balat sent her You too And that was it She set the spanreed aside then read over the entire conversation memorizing it Then she crumpled up the sheets and walked into the sitting room of Jasnahs quarters She wasnt thereJasnah rarely broke from her studiesso Shallan burned the conversation in the hearth She stood for a long moment watching the fire She was worried Nan Balat was capable but they all bore scars from the lives theyd led Eylita was the only scribe they could trust and shewell she was incredibly nice but not very clever With a sigh Shallan left the room to return to her studies Not only would they help get her mind off her troubles but Jasnah would grow testy if she dallied too long Five hours later Shallan wondered why it was shed been so eager She did enjoy her chances at scholarship But recently Jasnah had set her to study the history of the Alethi monarchy It wasnt the most interesting subject around Her boredom was compounded by her being forced to read a number of books that expressed opinions she found ridiculous She sat in Jasnahs alcove at the Veil The enormous wall of lights alcoves and mysterious researchers no longer awed her The place was becoming comfortable and familiar She was alone at the moment Shallan rubbed her eyes with her freehand then slid her book closed I she muttered am really coming to hate the Alethi monarchy Is that so a calm voice said from behind Jasnah walked past wearing a sleek violet dress followed by a parshman porter with a stack of books Ill try not to take it personally Shallan winced then blushed furiously I didnt mean individually Brightness Jasnah I meant categorically Jasnah lithely took her seat in the alcove She raised an eyebrow at Shallan then gestured for the parshman to set down his burden Shallan still found Jasnah an enigma At times she seemed a stern scholar annoyed by Shallans interruptions At other times there seemed to be a hint of wry humor hiding behind the stern facade Either way Shallan was finding that she felt remarkably comfortable around the woman Jasnah encouraged her to speak her mind something Shallan had taken to gladly I assume from your outburst that this topic is wearing on you Jasnah said sorting through her volumes as the parshman withdrew You expressed interest in being a scholar Well you must learn that this is scholarship Reading argument after argument from people who refuse to see any other point of view Theyre confident Im not an expert on confidence Brightness Shallan said holding up a book and inspecting it critically But Id like to think that I could recognize it if it were before me I dont think thats the right word for books like this one from Mederia They feel more arrogant than confident to me She sighed setting the book aside To be honest arrogant doesnt feel like quite the right word Its not specific enough And what would be the right word then I dont know Errorgant perhaps Jasnah raised a skeptical eyebrow It means to be twice as certain as someone who is merely arrogant Shallan said while possessing only onetenth the requisite facts Her words drew a hint of a smile from Jasnah What you are reacting against is known as the Assuredness Movement Shallan This errorgance is a literary device The scholars are intentionally overstating their case The Assuredness Movement Shallan asked holding up one of her books I guess I could get behind that Oh Yes Much easier to stab it in the back from that position That got only an eyebrow raise So more seriously Shallan continued I suppose I can understand the device Brightness but these books youve given me on King Gavilars death are more and more irrational in defending their points What began as a rhetorical conceit seems to have descended into namecalling and squabbling They are trying to provoke discussion Would you rather that the scholars hide from the truth like so many You would have men prefer ignorance When reading these books scholarship and ignorance feel much alike to me Shallan said Ignorance may reside in a man hiding from intelligence but scholarship can seem ignorance hidden behind intelligence And what of intelligence without ignorance Finding truth while not dismissing the possibility of being wrong A mythological treasure Brightness much like the Dawnshards or the Honorblades Certainly worth seeking but only with great caution Caution Jasnah said frowning It would make you famous but actually finding it would destroy us all Proof that one can be both intelligent and accept the intelligence of those who disagree with you Why I should think it would undermine the scholarly world in its entirety Jasnah sniffed You go too far child If you took half the energy you devote to being witty and channeled it into your work I daresay you could be one of the greatest scholars of our age Im sorry Brightness Shallan said Iwell Im confused Considering the gaps in my education I assumed you would have me studying things deeper in the past than a few years ago Jasnah opened one of her books I have found that youths like you have a relative lack of appreciation for the distant past Therefore I selected an area of study that is both more recent and sensational to ease you into true scholarship Is the murder of a king not of interest to you Yes Brightness Shallan said We children love things that are shiny and loud You have quite the mouth on you at times At times You mean its not there at others Ill have to Shallan trailed off then bit her lip realizing shed gone too far Sorry Never apologize for being clever Shallan It sets a bad precedent However one must apply ones wit with care You often seem to say the first passably clever thing that enters your mind I know Shallan said Its long been a foible of mine Brightness One my nurses and tutors tried very hard to discourage Likely through strict punishments Yes Making me sit in the corner holding books over my head was the preferred method Which in turn Jasnah said with a sigh only trained you to make your quips more quickly for you knew you had to get them out before you could reconsider and suppress them Shallan cocked her head The punishments were incompetent Jasnah said Used upon one such as yourself they were actually encouragement A game How much would you have to say to earn a punishment Could you say something so clever that your tutors missed the joke Sitting in the corner just gave you more time to compose retorts But its unseemly for a young woman to speak as I so often do The only unseemly thing is to not channel your intelligence usefully Consider You have trained yourself to do something very similar to what annoys you in the scholars cleverness without thought behind itintelligence one might say without a foundation of proper consideration Jasnah turned a page Errorgant wouldnt you say Shallan blushed I prefer my wards to be clever Jasnah said It gives me more to work with I should bring you to court with me I suspect that Wit at least would find you amusingif only because your apparent natural timidity and your clever tongue make such an intriguing combination Yes Brightness Please just remember that a womans mind is her most precious weapon It must not be employed clumsily or prematurely Much like the aforementioned knife to the back a clever gibe is most effective when it is unanticipated Im sorry Brightness It wasnt an admonition Jasnah said turning a page Simply an observation I make them on occasion Those books are musty The sky is blue today My ward is a smartlipped reprobate Shallan smiled Now tell me what youve discovered Shallan grimaced Not much Brightness Or should I say too much Each writer has her own theories on why the Parshendi killed your father Some claim he must have insulted them at the feast that night Others say that the entire treaty was a ruse intended to get the Parshendi close to him But that makes little sense as they had much better opportunities earlier And the Assassin in White Jasnah asked A true anomaly Shallan said The undertexts are filled with commentary about him Why would the Parshendi hire an outside assassin Did they fear they could not accomplish the job themselves Or perhaps they didnt hire him and were framed Many think that is unlikely considering that the Parshendi took credit for the murder And your thoughts I feel inadequate to draw conclusions Brightness What is the point of research if not to draw conclusions My tutors told me that supposition was only for the very experienced Shallan explained Jasnah sniffed Your tutors were idiots Youthful immaturity is one of the cosmeres great catalysts for change Shallan Do you realize that the Sunmaker was only seventeen when he began his conquest Gavarah hadnt reached her twentieth Weeping when she proposed the theory of the three realms But for every Sunmaker or Gavarah are there not a hundred Gregorhs He had been a youthful king notorious for beginning a pointless war with kingdoms that had been his fathers allies There was only one Gregorh Jasnah said with a grimace thankfully Your point is a valid one Hence the purpose of education To be young is about action To be a scholar is about informed action Or about sitting in an alcove reading about a fiveyearold murder I would not have you studying this if there were no point to it Jasnah said opening up another of her own books Too many scholars think of research as purely a cerebral pursuit If we do nothing with the knowledge we gain then we have wasted our study Books can store information better than we canwhat we do that books can not is interpret So if one is not going to draw conclusions then one might as well just leave the information in the texts Shallan sat back thoughtful Presented that way it somehow made her want to dig back into the studies What was it that Jasnah wanted her to do with the information Once again she felt a stab of guilt Jasnah was taking great pains to instruct her in scholarship and she was going to reward the woman by stealing her most valuable possession and leaving a broken replacement It made Shallan feel sick She had expected study beneath Jasnah to involve meaningless memorization and busywork accompanied by chastisement for not being smart enough That was how her tutors had approached her instruction Jasnah was different She gave Shallan a topic and the freedom to pursue it as she wished Jasnah offered encouragement and speculation but nearly all of their conversations turned to topics like the true nature of scholarship the purpose of studying the beauty of knowledge and its application Jasnah Kholin truly loved learning and she wanted others to as well Behind the stern gaze intense eyes and rarely smiling lips Jasnah Kholin truly believed in what she was doing Whatever that was Shallan raised one of her books but covertly eyed the spines of Jasnahs latest stack of tomes More histories about the Heraldic Epochs Mythologies commentaries books by scholars known to be wild speculators Jasnahs current volume was called Shadows Remembered Shallan memorized the title She would try to find a copy and look through it What was Jasnah pursuing What secrets was she hoping to pry from these volumes most of them centuriesold copies of copies Though Shallan had discovered some secrets regarding the Soulcaster the nature of Jasnahs questthe reason the princess had come to Kharbranthremained elusive Maddeningly yet tantalizingly so Jasnah liked to speak of the great women of the past ones who had not just recorded history but shaped it Whatever it was she studied she felt that it was important Worldchanging You mustnt be drawn in Shallan told herself settling back with book and notes Your goal is not to change the world Your goal is to protect your brothers and your house Still she needed to make a good show of her wardship And that gave her a reason to immerse herself for two hours until footsteps in the hallway interrupted Likely the servants bringing the midday meal Jasnah and Shallan often ate on their balcony Shallans stomach grumbled as she smelled the food and she gleefully set aside her book She usually sketched at lunch an activity that Jasnahdespite her dislike of the visual artsencouraged She said that highborn men often thought drawing and painting to be enticing in a woman and so Shallan should maintain her skills if only for the purpose of attracting suitors Shallan didnt know whether to find that insulting or not And what did it say about Jasnahs own intentions for marriage that she herself never bothered with the more becoming feminine arts like music or drawing Your Majesty Jasnah said rising smoothly Shallan started and looked hastily over her shoulder The elderly king of Kharbranth was standing in the doorway wearing magnificent orange and white robes with detailed embroidery Shallan scrambled to her feet Brightness Jasnah the king said Am I interrupting Your company is never an interruption Your Majesty Jasnah said She had to be as surprised as Shallan was yet didnt display a moment of discomfort or anxiety We were soon to take lunch anyway I know Brightness Taravangian said I hope you dont mind if I join you A group of servants began bringing in food and a table Not at all Jasnah said The servants hurried to set things up putting two different tablecloths on the round table to separate the genders during dining They secured the halfmoons of clothred for the king blue for the womenwith weights at the center Covered plates filled with food followed a clear cold stew with sweet vegetables for the women a spicysmelling broth for the king Kharbranthians preferred soups for their lunches Shallan was surprised to see them set a place for her Her father had never eaten at the same table as his childreneven she his favorite had been relegated to her own table Once Jasnah sat Shallan did likewise Her stomach growled again and the king waved for them to begin His motions seemed ungainly compared with Jasnahs elegance Shallan was soon eating contentedlywith grace as a woman should safehand in her lap using her freehand and a skewer to spear chunks of vegetable or fruit The king slurped but he wasnt as noisy as many men Why had he deigned to visit Wouldnt a formal dinner invitation have been more proper Of course shed learned that Taravangian wasnt known for his mastery of protocol He was a popular king beloved by the darkeyes as a builder of hospitals However the lighteyes considered him less than bright He was not an idiot In lighteyed politics unfortunately being only average was a disadvantage As they ate the silence drew out becoming awkward Several times the king looked as if he wanted to say something but then turned back to his soup He seemed intimidated by Jasnah And how is your granddaughter Your Majesty Jasnah eventually asked She is recovering well Quite well thank you Taravangian said as if relieved to begin conversing Though she now avoids the narrower corridors of the Conclave I do want to thank you for your aid It is always fulfilling to be of service Your Majesty If you will forgive my saying so the ardents do not think much of your service Taravangian said I realize it is likely a sensitive topic Perhaps I shouldnt mention it but No feel free Jasnah said eating a small green lurnip from the end of her skewer I am not ashamed of my choices Then youll forgive an old mans curiosity I always forgive curiosity Your Majesty Jasnah said It strikes me as one of the most genuine of emotions Then where did you find it Taravangian asked nodding toward the Soulcaster which Jasnah wore covered by a black glove How did you keep it from the devotaries One might find those questions dangerous Your Majesty Ive already acquired some new enemies by welcoming you You will be forgiven Jasnah said Depending on the devotary you have chosen Forgiven Me The elderly man seemed to find that amusing and for a moment Shallan thought she saw deep regret in his expression Unlikely But that is something else entirely Please I stand by my questions And I stand by my evasiveness Your Majesty Im sorry I do forgive your curiosity but I can not reward it These secrets are mine Of course of course The king sat back looking embarrassed Now you probably assume I brought this meal simply to ambush you about the fabrial You had another purpose then Well you see Ive heard the most wonderful things about your wards artistic skill I thought that maybe He smiled at Shallan Of course Your Majesty Shallan said Id be happy to draw your likeness He beamed as she stood leaving her meal half eaten and gathering her things She glanced at Jasnah but the older womans face was unreadable Would you prefer a simple portrait against a white background Shallan asked Or would you prefer a broader perspective including surroundings Perhaps Jasnah said pointedly you should wait until the meal is finished Shallan Shallan blushed feeling a fool for her enthusiasm Of course No no the king said Im quite finished A wider sketch would be perfect child How would you like me to sit He slid his chair back posing and smiling in a grandfatherly way She blinked fixing the image in her mind That is perfect Your Majesty You can return to your meal Dont you need me to sit still Ive posed for portraits before Its all right Shallan assured him sitting down Very well he said pulling back to the table I do apologize for making you use me of all people as a subject for your art This face of mine isnt the most impressive one youve depicted Im sure Nonsense Shallan said A face like yours is just what an artist needs It is Yes the She cut herself off Shed been about to quip Yes the skin is enough like parchment to make an ideal canvas that handsome nose of yours and wise furrowed skin It will be quite striking in the black charcoal Oh well then Proceed Though I still cant see how youll work without me holding a pose Brightness Shallan has some unique talents Jasnah said Shallan began her sketch I suppose that she must the king said Ive seen the drawing she did for Varas Varas Jasnah asked The Palanaeums assistant chief of collections the king said A distant cousin of mine He says the staff is quite taken with your young ward How did you find her Unexpectedly Jasnah said and in need of an education The king cocked his head The artistic skill I can not claim Jasnah said It was a preexisting condition Ah a blessing of the Almighty You might say that But you would not I assume Taravangian chuckled awkwardly Shallan drew quickly establishing the shape of his head He shuffled uncomfortably Is it hard for you Jasnah Painful I mean Atheism is not a disease Your Majesty Jasnah said dryly Its not as if Ive caught a foot rash Of course not of course not Buter isnt it difficult having nothing in which to believe Shallan leaned forward still sketching but keeping her attention on the conversation Shallan had assumed that training under a heretic would be a little more exciting She and Kabsalthe witty ardent whom shed met on her first day in Kharbranthhad chatted several times now about Jasnahs faith However around Jasnah herself the topic almost never came up When it did Jasnah usually changed it Today however she did not Perhaps she sensed the sincerity in the kings question I wouldnt say that I have nothing to believe in Your Majesty Actually I have much to believe in My brother and my uncle my own abilities The things I was taught by my parents But what is right and wrong youveWell youve discarded that Just because I do not accept the teachings of the devotaries does not mean Ive discarded a belief in right and wrong But the Almighty determines what is right Must someone some unseen thing declare what is right for it to be right I believe that my own moralitywhich answers only to my heartis more sure and true than the morality of those who do right only because they fear retribution But that is the soul of law the king said sounding confused If there is no punishment there can be only chaos If there were no law some men would do as they wish yes Jasnah said But isnt it remarkable that given the chance for personal gain at the cost of others so many people choose what is right Because they fear the Almighty No Jasnah said I think something innate in us understands that seeking the good of society is usually best for the individual as well Humankind is noble when we give it the chance to be That nobility is something that exists independent of any gods decree I just dont see how anything could be outside Gods decrees The king shook his head bemused Brightness Jasnah I dont mean to argue but isnt the very definition of the Almighty that all things exist because of him If you add one and one that makes two does it not Well yes No god needs declare it so for it to be true Jasnah said So could we not say that mathematics exists outside the Almighty independent of him Perhaps Well Jasnah said I simply claim that morality and human will are independent of him too If you say that the king said chuckling then youve removed all purpose for the Almightys existence Indeed The balcony fell silent Jasnahs sphere lamps cast a cool even white light across them For an uncomfortable moment the only sound was the scratching of Shallans charcoal on her drawing pad She worked with quick scraping motions disturbed by the things that Jasnah had said They made her feel hollow inside That was partly because the king for all his affability was not good at arguing He was a dear man but no match for Jasnah in a conversation Well Taravangian said I must say that you make your points quite effectively I dont accept them though My intention is not to convert Your Majesty Jasnah said I am content keeping my beliefs to myself something most of my colleagues in the devotaries have difficulty doing Shallan have you finished yet Quite nearly Brightness But its been barely a few minutes the king said She has remarkable skill Your Majesty Jasnah said As I believe I mentioned Shallan sat back inspecting her piece Shed been so focused on the conversation shed just let her hands do the drawing trusting in her instincts The sketch depicted the king sitting in his chair with a wise expression the turretlike balcony walls behind him The doorway into the balcony was to his right Yes it was a good likeness Not her best work but Shallan froze her breath catching her heart lurching in her chest She had drawn something standing in the doorway behind the king Two tall and willowy creatures with cloaks that split down the front and hung at the sides too stiffly as if they were made of glass Above the stiff high collars where the creatures heads should be each had a large floating symbol of twisted design full of impossible angles and geometries Shallan sat stunned Why had she drawn those things What had driven her to She snapped her head up The hallway was empty The creatures hadnt been part of the Memory shed taken Her hands had simply drawn them of their accord Shallan Jasnah said By reflex Shallan dropped her charcoal and grabbed the sheet in her freehand crumpling it Im sorry Brightness I paid too much attention to the conversation I let myself grow sloppy Well certainly we can at least see it child the king said standing Shallan tightened her grip Please no She has an artists temperament at times Your Majesty Jasnah sighed There will be no getting it out of her Ill do you another Your Majesty Shallan said Im so sorry He rubbed his wispy beard Yes well it was going to be a gift for my granddaughter By the end of the day Shallan promised That would be wonderful Youre certain you dont need me to pose No no that wont be necessary Your Majesty Shallan said Her pulse was still racing and she couldnt shake the image of those two distorted figures from her mind so she took another Memory of the king She could use that to create a more suitable picture Well then the king said I suppose I should be going I wish to visit one of the hospitals and the sick You can send the drawing to my rooms but take your time Really it is quite all right Shallan curtsied crushed paper still held to her breast The king withdrew with his attendants several parshmen entering to remove the table Ive never known you to make a mistake in drawing Jasnah said sitting back down at the desk At least not one so horrible that you destroyed the paper Shallan blushed Even the master of an art may err I suppose Go ahead and take the next hour to do His Majesty a proper portrait Shallan looked down at the ruined sketch The creatures were simply her fancy the product of letting her mind wander That was all Just imagination Perhaps there was something in her subconscious that shed needed to express But what could the figures mean then I noticed that at one point when you were speaking to the king you hesitated Jasnah said What didnt you say Something inappropriate But clever Cleverness never seems quite so impressive when regarded outside the moment Brightness It was just a silly thought And you replaced it with an empty compliment I think you misunderstood what I was trying to explain child I do not wish for you to remain silent It is good to be clever But if Id spoken Shallan said Id have insulted the king perhaps confused him as well which would have caused him embarrassment I am certain he knows what people say about his slowness of thought Jasnah sniffed Idle words From foolish people But perhaps it was wise not to speak though keep in mind that channeling your capacities and stifling them are two separate things Id much prefer you to think of something both clever and appropriate Yes Brightness Besides Jasnah said I believe you might have made Taravangian laugh He seems haunted by something lately You dont find him dull then Shallan asked curious She herself didnt think the king dull or a fool but shed thought someone as intelligent and learned as Jasnah might not have patience for a man like him Taravangian is a wonderful man Jasnah said and worth a hundred selfproclaimed experts on courtly ways He reminds me of my uncle Dalinar Earnest sincere concerned The lighteyes here say hes weak Shallan said Because he panders to so many other monarchs because he fears war because he doesnt have a Shardblade Jasnah didnt reply though she looked disturbed Brightness Shallan prodded walking to her own seat and arranging her charcoals In ancient days Jasnah said a man who brought peace to his kingdom was considered to be of great worth Now that same man would be derided as a coward She shook her head It has been centuries coming this change It should terrify us We could do with more men like Taravangian and I shall require you to never call him dull again not even in passing Yes Brightness Shallan said bowing her head Did you really believe the things you said About the Almighty Jasnah was quiet for a moment I do Though perhaps I overstated my conviction The Assuredness Movement of rhetorical theory Yes Jasnah said I suppose that it was I must be careful not to put my back toward you as I read today Shallan smiled A true scholar must not close her mind close on any topic Jasnah said no matter how certain she may feel Just because I have not yet found a convincing reason to join one of the devotaries does not mean I never will Though each time I have a discussion like the one today my convictions grow firmer Shallan bit her lip Jasnah noticed the expression You will need to learn to control that Shallan It makes your feelings obvious Yes Brightness Well out with it Just that your conversation with the king was not entirely fair Oh Because of his well you know His limited capacity He did quite remarkably but didnt make the arguments that someone more versed in Vorin theology might have And what arguments might such a one have made Well Im not very well trained in that area myself But I do think that you ignored or at least minimized one vital part of the discussion Which is Shallan tapped at her breast Our hearts Brightness I believe because I feel something a closeness to the Almighty a peace that comes when I live my faith The mind is capable of projecting expected emotional responses But didnt you yourself argue that the way we actthe way we feel about right and wrongwas a defining attribute of our humanity You used our innate morality to prove your point So how can you discard my feelings Discard them No Regard them with skepticism Perhaps Your feelings Shallanhowever powerfulare your own Not mine And what I feel is that spending my life trying to earn the favor of an unseen unknown and unknowable being who watches me from the sky is an exercise in sheer futility She pointed at Shallan with her pen But your rhetorical method is improving Well make a scholar of you yet Shallan smiled feeling a surge of pleasure Praise from Jasnah was more precious than an emerald broam ButIm not going to be a scholar Im going to steal the Soulcaster and leave She didnt like to think about that That was something else shed have to get over she tended to avoid thinking about things that made her uncomfortable Now hurry and be about the kings sketch Jasnah said lifting a book You still have a great deal of real work to do once you are done drawing Yes Brightness Shallan said For once however she found sketching difficult her mind too troubled to focus They were suddenly dangerous Like a calm day that became a tempest This fragment is the origin of a Thaylen proverb that was eventually reworked into a more common derivation I believe it may reference the Voidbringers See Ixsixs Emperor fourth chapter Kaladin walked from the cavernous barrack into the pure light of first morning Bits of quartz in the ground sparkled before him catching the light as if the ground were sparking and burning ready to burst from within A group of twentynine men followed him Slaves Thieves Deserters Foreigners Even a few men whose only sin had been poverty Those had joined the bridge crews out of desperation The pay was good when compared with nothing and they were promised that if they survived a hundred bridge runs they would be promoted Assignment to a watch postwhich in the mind of a poor man sounded like a life of luxury Being paid to stand and look at things all day What kind of insanity was that It was like being rich almost They didnt understand Nobody survived a hundred bridge runs Kaladin had been on two dozen and he was already one of the most experienced living bridgemen Bridge Four followed him The last of the holdoutsa thin man named Bisighad given in yesterday Kaladin preferred to think that the laughter the food and the humanity had finally gotten to him But it had probably been a few glares or underthebreath threats from Rock and Teft Kaladin turned a blind eye to those Hed eventually need the mens loyalty but for now hed settle for obedience He guided them through the morning exercises hed learned his very first day in the military Stretches followed by jumping motions Carpenters in brown work overalls and tan or green caps passed on their way to the lumberyard shaking their heads in amusement Soldiers on the short ridge above where the camp proper began looked down and laughed Gaz watched from beside a nearby barrack arms folded single eye dissatisfied Kaladin wiped his brow He met Gazs eye for a long moment then turned back to the men There was still time to practice hauling the bridge before breakfast Gaz had never gotten used to having just one eye Could a man get used to that Hed rather have lost a hand or a leg than that eye He couldnt stop feeling that something hid in that darkness he couldnt see but others could What lurked there Spren that would drain his soul from his body The way a rat could empty an entire wineskin by chewing the corner His companions called him lucky That blow could have taken your life Well at least then he wouldnt have had to live with that darkness One of his eyes was always closed Close the other and the darkness swallowed him Gaz glanced left and the darkness scuttled to the side Lamaril stood leaning against a post tall and slim He was not a massive man but he was not weak He was all lines Rectangular beard Rectangular body Sharp Like a knife Lamaril waved Gaz over so he reluctantly approached Then he took a sphere out of his pouch and passed it over A topaz mark He hated losing it He always hated losing money You owe me twice as much as this Lamaril noted raising the sphere up to look through it as it sparkled in the sunlight Well thats all youll get for now Be glad you get anything Be glad Ive kept my mouth shut Lamaril said lazily leaning back against his post It was one that marked the edge of the lumberyard Gaz gritted his teeth He hated to pay but what else could he do Storms take him Raging storms take him You have a problem it seems Lamaril said At first Gaz thought he meant the half payment The lighteyed man nodded toward Bridge Fours barracks Gaz eyed the bridgemen unsettled The youthful bridgeleader barked an order and the bridgemen raced the span of the lumberyard in a jog He already had them running in time with one another That one change meant so much It sped them up helped them think like a team Could this boy actually have military training as hed once claimed Why would he be wasted as a bridgeman Of course there was that shash brand on his forehead I dont see a problem Gaz said with a grunt Theyre fast Thats good Theyre insubordinate They follow orders His orders perhaps Lamaril shook his head Bridgemen exist for one purpose Gaz To protect the lives of more valuable men Really And here I thought their purpose was to carry bridges Lamaril gave him a sharp look He leaned forward Dont try me Gaz And dont forget your place Would you like to join them Gaz felt a spike of fear Lamaril was a very lowly lighteyes one of the landless But he was Gazs immediate superior a liaison between bridge crews and the higherranked lighteyes who oversaw the lumberyard Gaz looked down at the ground Im sorry Brightlord Highprince Sadeas holds an edge Lamaril said leaning back against his post He maintains it by pushing us all Hard Each man in his place He nodded toward the members of Bridge Four Speed is not a bad thing Initiative is not a bad thing But men with initiative like that boys are not often happy in their position The bridge crews function as they are without need for modification Change can be unsettling Gaz doubted that any of the bridgemen really understood their place in Sadeass plans If they knew why they were worked as pitilessly as they wereand why they were forbidden shields or armorthey likely would just cast themselves into the chasm Bait They were bait Draw the Parshendi attention let the savages think they were doing some good by felling a few bridges worth of bridgemen every assault So long as you took plenty of men that didnt matter Except to those who were slaughtered Stormfather Gaz thought I hate myself for being a part of this But hed hated himself for a long time now It wasnt anything new to him Ill do something he promised Lamaril A knife in the night Poison in the food That twisted his insides The boys bribes were small but they were all that let him keep ahead of his payments to Lamaril No Lamaril hissed You want it seen that he was really a threat The real soldiers are already talking about him Lamaril grimaced The last thing we need is a martyr inspiring rebellion among the bridgemen I dont want any hint of it nothing our highprinces enemies could take advantage of Lamaril glanced at Kaladin jogging past again with his men That one has to fall on the field as he deserves Make certain it happens And get me the rest of the money you owe or youll soon find yourself carrying one of those bridges yourself He swept away forestgreen cloak fluttering In his time as a soldier Gaz had learned to fear the minor lighteyes the most They were galled by their closeness in rank to the darkeyes yet those darkeyes were the only ones they had any authority over That made them dangerous Being around a man like Lamaril was like handling a hot coal with bare fingers There was no way to avoid burning yourself You just hoped to be quick enough to keep the burns to a minimum Bridge Four ran by A month ago Gaz wouldnt have believed this possible A group of bridgemen practicing And all it seemed to have cost Kaladin was a few bribes of food and some empty promises that he would protect them That shouldnt have been enough Life as a bridgeman was hopeless Gaz couldnt join them He just couldnt Kaladin the lordling had to fall But if Kaladins spheres vanished Gaz could just as easily end up as a bridgeman for failing to pay Lamaril Storming Damnation he thought It was like trying to choose which claw of the chasmfiend would crush you Gaz continued to watch Kaladins crew And still that darkness waited for him Like an itch that couldnt be scratched Like a scream that couldnt be silenced A tingling numbness that he could never be rid of It would probably follow him even into death Bridge up Kaladin bellowed running with Bridge Four They raised the bridge over their heads while still moving It was harder to run this way holding the bridge up rather than resting it on the shoulders He felt its enormous weight on his arms Down he ordered Those at the front let go of the bridge and ran out to the sides The others lowered the bridge in a quick motion It hit the ground awkwardly scraping the stone They got into position pretending to move it across a chasm Kaladin helped at the side Well need to practice on a real chasm he thought as the men finished I wonder what kind of bribe it would take for Gaz to let me do that The bridgemen finished with their mock bridge run looked toward Kaladin exhausted but excited He smiled at them As a squadleader those months in Amarams army hed learned that praise should be honest but it should never be withheld We need to work on that setdown Kaladin said But overall Im impressed Two weeks and youre already working together as well as some teams I trained for months Im pleased And proud Go get something to drink and take a break Well do one or two more runs before work detail It was stonegathering duty again but that was nothing to complain about Hed convinced the men that lifting the stones would improve their strength and had enlisted the few he trusted the most to help gather the knobweed the means by which he continued tojust barelykeep the men supplied with extra food and build his stock of medical supplies Two weeks An easy two weeks as the lives of bridgemen went Only two bridge runs and on one theyd gotten to the plateau too late The Parshendi had escaped with the gemheart before theyd even arrived That was good for bridgemen The other assault hadnt been too bad by bridgeman numbers Two more dead Amark and Koolf Two more wounded Narm and Peet A fraction of what the other crews had lost but still too many Kaladin tried to keep his expression optimistic as he walked to the water barrel and took a ladle from one of the men drinking it down Bridge Four would drown in its own wounded They were only thirty strong with five wounded who drew no pay and had to be fed out of the knobweed income Counting those whod died theyd taken nearly thirty percent casualties in the weeks hed begun trying to protect them In Amarams army that rate of casualties would have been catastrophic Back then Kaladins life had been one of training and marching punctuated by occasional frenzied bursts of battle Here the fighting was relentless Every few days That kind of thing couldwouldwear an army down There has to be a better way Kaladin thought swishing the lukewarm water in his mouth then pouring another ladle on his head He couldnt continue to lose two men a week to death and wounds But how could they survive when their own officers didnt care if they lived or died He barely kept himself from throwing the ladle into the barrel in frustration Instead he handed it to Skar and gave him an encouraging smile A lie But an important one Gaz watched from the shadow of one of the other bridgeman barracks Syls translucent figureshaped now like floating knobweed fluffflitted around the bridge sergeant Eventually she made her way over to Kaladin landing on his shoulder taking her female form Hes planning something she said He hasnt interfered Kaladin said He hasnt even tried to stop us from having the nightly stew He was talking to that lighteyes Lamaril She nodded Lamarils his superior Kaladin said as he walked into the shade of Bridge Fours barrack He leaned against the wall looking over at his men by the water barrel They talked to one another now Joked Laughed They went out drinking together in the evenings Stormfather but he never thought hed be glad that the men under his command went drinking I didnt like their expressions Syl said sitting down on Kaladins shoulder Dark Like thunderclouds I didnt hear what they were saying I noticed them too late But I dont like it particularly that Lamaril Kaladin nodded slowly You dont trust him either Syl asked Hes a lighteyes That was enough So we So we do nothing Kaladin said I cant respond unless they try something And if I spend all of my energy worrying about what they might do I wont be able to solve the problems were facing right now What he didnt add was his real worry If Gaz or Lamaril decided to have Kaladin killed there was little he could to do to stop them True bridgemen were rarely executed for anything other than failing to run their bridge But even in an honest force like Amarams there had been rumors of trumpedup charges and fake evidence In Sadeass undisciplined barely regulated camp nobody would blink if Kaladina shashbranded slavewere strung up on some nebulous charge They could leave him for the highstorm washing their hands of his death claiming that the Stormfather had chosen his fate Kaladin stood up straight and walked toward the carpentry section of the lumberyard The craftsmen and their apprentices were hard at work cutting lengths of wood for spear hafts bridges posts or furniture The craftsmen nodded to Kaladin as he passed They were familiar with him now used to his odd requests like pieces of lumber long enough for four men to hold and run with to practice keeping cadence with one another He found a halffinished bridge It had eventually grown out of that one plank that Kaladin had used Kaladin knelt down inspecting the wood A group of men worked with a large saw just to his right slicing thin rounds off a log Those would probably become chair seats He ran his fingers along the smooth hardwood All mobile bridges were made of a kind of wood called makam It had a deep brown color the grain almost hidden and was both strong and light The craftsmen had sanded this length smooth and it smelled of sawdust and musky sap Kaladin Syl asked walking through the air then stepping onto the wood You look distant Its ironic how well they craft these bridges he said This armys carpenters are far more professional than its soldiers That makes sense she said The craftsmen want to make bridges that last The soldiers I listen to they just want to get to the plateau grab the gemheart and get away Its like a game to them Thats astute Youre getting better and better at observing us She grimaced I feel more like Im remembering things I once knew Soon youll hardly be a spren at all Youll be a little translucent philosopher Well have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time in deep important thoughts Yes she said like how to best get the ardents there to accidentally drink a mixture that will turn his mouth blue She smiled mischievously Kaladin smiled back but kept running his finger across the wood He still didnt understand why they wouldnt let bridgemen carry shields Nobody would give him a straight answer on the question They use makam because its strong enough for its weight to support a heavy cavalry charge he said We should be able to use this They deny us shields but we already carry one on our shoulders But how would they react if you try that Kaladin stood I dont know but I also dont have any other choice Trying this would be a risk A huge risk But hed run out of nonrisky ideas days ago We can hold it here Kaladin said pointing for Rock Teft Skar and Moash They stood beside a bridge turned up on its side its underbelly exposed The bottom was a complicated construction with eight rows of three positions accommodating up to twentyfour men directly underneath then sixteen sets of handleseight on each sidefor sixteen more men on the outside Forty men running shoulder to shoulder if they had a full complement Each position underneath the bridge had an indentation for the bridgemans head two curved blocks of wood to rest on his shoulders and two rods for handholds The bridgemen wore shoulder pads and those who were shorter wore extras to compensate Gaz generally tried to assign new bridgemen to crews based on their height That didnt hold for Bridge Four of course Bridge Four just got the leftovers Kaladin pointed to several rods and struts We could grab here then run straight forward carrying the bridge on its side to our right at a slant We put our taller men on the outside and our shorter men on the inside What good would that do Rock asked frowning Kaladin glanced at Gaz who was watching from nearby Uncomfortably close Best not to speak of why he really wanted to carry the bridge on its side Besides he didnt want to get the mens hopes up until he knew if it would work I just want to experiment he said If we can shift positions occasionally it might be easier Work different muscles Syl frowned as she stood on the top of the bridge She always frowned when Kaladin obscured the truth Gather the men Kaladin said waving to Rock Teft Skar and Moash Hed named the four as his subsquad commanders something that bridgemen didnt normally have But soldiers worked best in smaller groups of six or eight Soldiers Kaladin thought Is that how I think of them They didnt fight But yes they were soldiers It was too easy to underestimate men when you considered them to be just bridgemen Charging straight at enemy archers without shields took courage Even when you were compelled to do it He glanced to the side noticing that Moash hadnt left with the other three The narrowfaced man had dark green eyes and brown hair flecked with black Something wrong soldier Kaladin asked Moash blinked in surprise at the use of the word but he and the others had grown to expect all kinds of unorthodoxy from Kaladin Why did you make me leader of a subsquad Because you resisted my leadership longer than almost any of the others And you were flatout more vocal about it than any of them You made me a squad leader because I refused to obey you I made you squad leader because you struck me as capable and intelligent But beyond that you werent swayed too easily Youre strongwilled I can use that Moash scratched his chin with its short beard All right then But unlike Teft and that Horneater I dont think youre a gift straight from the Almighty I dont trust you Then why obey me Moash met his eyes then shrugged Guess Im curious He moved off to gather his squad What in the raging winds Gaz thought dumbfounded as he watched Bridge Four charge past What had possessed them to try carrying the bridge to the side It required them to clump up in an odd way forming three rows instead of five awkwardly clutching the underside of the bridge and holding it off to their right It was one of the strangest things hed ever seen They could barely all fit and the handholds werent made for carrying the bridge that way Gaz scratched his head as he watched them pass then held out a hand stopping Kaladin as he jogged by The lordling let go of the bridge and hurried up to Gaz wiping his brow as the others continued running Yes What is that Gaz said pointing Bridge crew Carrying what I believe isyes its a bridge I didnt ask for lip Gaz snarled I want an explanation Carrying the bridge over our heads gets tiring Kaladin said He was a tall man tall enough to tower over Gaz Storm it I will not be intimidated This is a way to use different muscles Like shifting a pack from one shoulder to the other Gaz glanced to the side Had something moved in the darkness Gaz Kaladin asked Look lordling Gaz said looking back to him Carrying it overhead may be tiring but carrying it like that is just plain stupid You look like youre about to stumble over one another and the handholds are terrible You can barely fit the men Yes Kaladin said more softly But a lot of the time only half of a bridge crew will survive a bridge run We can carry it back this way when there are fewer of us It will let us shift positions at least Gaz hesitated Only half a bridge crew If they carried the bridge like that on an actual assault theyd go slowly expose themselves It could be a disaster for Bridge Four at least Gaz smiled I like it Kaladin looked shocked What Initiative Creativity Yes keep practicing Id very much like to see you make a plateau approach carrying the bridge that way Kaladin narrowed his eyes Is that so Yes Gaz said Well then Perhaps we will Gaz smiled watching Kaladin retreat A disaster was exactly what he needed Now he just had to find some other way to pay Lamarils blackmail SIX YEARS AGO Dont make the same mistake I did son Kal looked up from his folio His father sat on the other side of the operating room one hand to his head halfempty cup of wine in his other Violet wine among the strongest of liquors Lirin set the cup down and the deep purple liquidthe color of cremling bloodshivered and trembled It refracted Stormlight from a couple of spheres sitting on the counter Father When you get to Kharbranth stay there His voice was slurred Dont get sucked back to this tiny backward foolish town Dont force your beautiful wife to live away from everyone else shes ever known or loved Kals father didnt often get drunk this was a rare night of indulgence Perhaps because Mother had gone to sleep early exhausted from her work Youve always said I should come back Kal said softly Im an idiot His back to Kal he stared at the wall splashed with white light from the spheres They dont want me here They never wanted me here Kal looked down at his folio It contained drawings of dissected bodies the muscles splayed and pulled out The drawings were so detailed Each had glyphpairs to designate every part and hed committed those to memory Now he studied the procedures delving into the bodies of men long dead Once Laral had told him that men werent supposed to see beneath the skin These folios with their pictures were part of what made everyone so mistrustful of Lirin Seeing beneath was like seeing beneath the clothing only worse Lirin poured himself more wine How much the world could change in a short time Kal pulled his coat close against the chill A season of winter had come but they couldnt afford charcoal for the brazier for patients no longer gave offerings Lirin hadnt stopped healing or surgery The townspeople had simply stopped their donations all at a word from Roshone He shouldnt be able to do this Kal whispered But he can Lirin said He wore a white shirt and black vest atop tan trousers The vest was unbuttoned the front flaps hanging down by his sides like the skin pulled back from the torsos of the men in Kals drawings We could spend the spheres Kal said hesitantly Those are for your education Lirin snapped If I could send you now I would Kals father and mother had sent a letter to the surgeons in Kharbranth asking them to let Kal take the entry tests early Theyd responded in the negative He wants us to spend them Lirin said words slurred Thats why he said what he did Hes trying to bully us into needing those spheres Roshones words to the townspeople hadnt exactly been a command Hed just implied that if Kals father was too foolish to charge then he shouldnt be paid The next day people had stopped donating The townsfolk regarded Roshone with a confusing mixture of adoration and fear In Kals opinion he didnt deserve either Obviously the man had been banished to Hearthstone because he was so bitter and flawed He clearly didnt deserve to be among the real lighteyes who fought for vengeance on the Shattered Plains Why do the people try so hard to please him Kal asked of his fathers back They never reacted this way around Brightlord Wistiow They do it because Roshone is unappeasable Kal frowned Was that the wine talking Kals father turned his eyes reflecting pure Stormlight In those eyes Kal saw a surprising lucidity He wasnt so drunk after all Brightlord Wistiow let men do as they wished And so they ignored him Roshone lets them know he finds them contemptible And so they scramble to please him That makes no sense Kal said It is the way of things Lirin said playing with one of the spheres on the table rolling it beneath his finger Youll have to learn this Kal When men perceive the world as being right we are content But if we see a holea deficiencywe scramble to fill it You make it sound noble what they do It is in a way Lirin said He sighed I shouldnt be so hard on our neighbors Theyre petty yes but its the pettiness of the ignorant Im not disgusted by them Im disgusted by the one who manipulates them A man like Roshone can take what is honest and true in men and twist it into a mess of sludge to walk on He took a sip finishing the wine We should just spend the spheres Kal said Or send them somewhere to a moneylender or something If they were gone hed leave us alone No Lirin said softly Roshone is not the kind to spare a man once he is beaten Hes the type who keeps kicking I dont know what political mistake landed him in this place but he obviously cant get revenge on his rivals So were all he has Lirin paused Poor fool Poor fool Kal thought Hes trying to destroy our lives and thats all Father can say What of the stories men sang at the hearths Tales of clever herdsmen outwitting and overthrowing a foolish lighteyed man There were dozens of variations and Kal had heard them all Shouldnt Lirin fight back somehow Do something other than sit and wait But he didnt say anything he knew exactly what Lirin would say Let me worry about it Get back to your studies Sighing Kal settled back in his chair opening his folio again The surgery room was dim lit by the four spheres on the table and a single one Kal used for reading Lirin kept most of the spheres closed up in their cupboard hidden away Kal held up his own sphere lighting the page There were longer explanations of procedures in the back that his mother could read to him She was the only woman in the town who could read though Lirin said it wasnt uncommon among wellborn darkeyed women in the cities As he studied Kal idly pulled something from his pocket A rock that had been sitting on his chair for him when hed come in to study He recognized it as a favorite one that Tien had been carrying around recently Now hed left it for Kaladin he often did that hoping that his older brother would be able to see the beauty in it too though they all just looked like ordinary rocks Hed have to ask Tien what he found so special about this particular one There was always something Tien spent his days now learning carpentry from Ral one of the men in the town Lirin had set him to it reluctantly hed been hoping for another surgery assistant but Tien couldnt stand the sight of blood He froze every time and hadnt gotten used to it That was troubling Kal had hoped that his father would have Tien as an assistant when he left And Kal was leaving one way or another He hadnt decided between the army or Kharbranth though in recent months hed begun leaning toward becoming a spearman If he took that route hed have to do it stealthily once he was old enough that the recruiters would take him over his parents objections Fifteen would probably be old enough Five more months For now he figured that knowing the musclesand vital parts of a bodywould be pretty useful for either a surgeon or a spearman A thump came at the door Kal jumped It hadnt been a knock but a thump It came again It sounded like something heavy pushing or slamming against the wood What in the stormwinds Lirin said rising from his stool He crossed the small room his undone vest brushed the operating table button scraping the wood Another thump Kal scrambled out of his chair closing the folio At fourteen and a half he was nearly as tall as his father now A scraping came at the door like nails or claws Kal raised a hand toward his father suddenly terrified It was late at night dark in the room and the town was silent There was something outside It sounded like a beast Inhuman A den of whitespines were said to be making trouble nearby striking at travelers on the roadway Kal had an image in his head of the reptilian creatures as big as horses but with carapace across their backs Was one of them sniffing at the door Brushing it trying to force its way in Father Kal yelped Lirin pulled open the door The dim light of the spheres revealed not a monster but a man wearing black clothing He had a long metal bar in his hands and he wore a black wool mask with holes cut for the eyes Kal felt his heart race in panic as the wouldbe intruder leapt backward Didnt expect to find anyone inside did you Kals father said Its been years since there was a theft in the town Im ashamed of you Give us the spheres a voice called out of the darkness Another figure moved in the shadows and then another Stormfather Kal clutched the folio to his chest with trembling hands How many are there Highwaymen come to rob the town Such things happened More and more frequently these days Kals father said How could Lirin be so calm Those spheres aint yours another voice called Is that so Kals father said Does that make them yours You think hed let you keep them Kals father spoke as if they werent bandits from outside the town Kal crept forward to stand just behind his father frightenedbut at the same time ashamed of that fear The men in the darkness were shadowy nightmarish things moving back and forth faces of black Well give them to him one voice said No need for this to get violent Lirin another added You aint going to spend them anyway Kals father snorted He ducked into the room Kal cried out moving back as Lirin threw open the cabinet where he kept the spheres He grabbed the large glass goblet that he stored them in it was covered with a black cloth You want them Lirin called walking to the doorway passing Kal Father Kal said panicked You want the light for yourself Lirins voice grew louder Here He pulled the cloth free The goblet exploded with fiery radiance the brightness nearly blinding Kal raised his arm His father was a shadowed silhouette that seemed to hold the sun itself in its fingers The large goblet shone with a calm light Almost a cold light Kal blinked away tears his eyes adjusting He could see the men outside clearly now Where dangerous shadows had once loomed cringing men now raised hands They didnt seem so intimidating in fact the cloths over their faces looked ridiculous Where Kal had been afraid he now felt strangely confident For a moment it wasnt light his father held but understanding itself Thats Luten Kal thought noticing a man who limped It was easy to distinguish him despite the mask Kals father had operated on that leg it was because of him that Luten could still walk He recognized others too Horl was the one with the wide shoulders Balsas the man wearing the nice new coat Lirin didnt say anything to them at first He stood with that light blazing illuminating the entire stone square outside The men seemed to shrink down as if they knew he recognized them Well Lirin said Youve threatened violence against me Come Hit me Rob me Do it knowing Ive lived among you almost my entire life Do it knowing that Ive healed your children Come in Bleed one of your own The men faded into the night without a word They lived high atop a place no man could reach but all could visit The tower city itself crafted by the hands of no man Though The Song of the Last Summer is a fanciful tale of romance from the third century after the Recreance it is likely a valid reference in this case See page 27 of Varalas translation and note the undertext They got better at carrying the bridge on its side But not much better Kaladin watched Bridge Four pass moving awkwardly maneuvering the bridge at their sides Fortunately there were plenty of handles on the bridges underside and theyd found how to grip them in the right way They had to carry it at less steep an angle than hed wanted That would expose their legs but may be he could train them to adjust to it as the arrows flew As it was their carry was slow and the bridgemen were so bunched up that if the Parshendi managed to drop a man the others would stumble over him Lose just a few men and the balance would be upset so theyd drop it for certain This will have to be handled very carefully Kaladin thought Syl fluttered along behind the bridge crew as a flurry of nearly translucent leaves Beyond her something caught Kaladins eye a uniformed soldier leading a ragged group of men in a despondent clump Finally Kaladin thought Hed been waiting for another group of recruits He waved curtly to Rock The Horneater nodded hed take over training It was time for a break anyway Kaladin jogged up the short incline at the rim of the lumberyard arriving just as Gaz intercepted the newcomers What a sorry batch Gaz said I thought wed been sent the dregs last time but this lot Lamaril shrugged Theyre yours now Gaz Split them up how you like He and his soldiers departed leaving the unfortunate conscripts Some wore decent clothing theyd be recently caught criminals The rest had slave brands on their foreheads Seeing them brought back feelings that Kaladin had to force down He still stood on the very top of a steep slope one wrong step could send him tumbling back down into that despair In a line you cremlings Gaz snapped at the new recruits pulling free his cudgel and waving it He eyed Kaladin but said nothing The group of men hastily lined up Gaz counted down the line picking out the taller members You five men youre in Bridge Six Remember that Forget it and Ill see you get a whipping He counted off another group You six men youre in Bridge Fourteen You four at the end Bridge Three You you and you Bridge One Bridge Two doesnt need anyYou four Bridge Seven That was all of them Gaz Kaladin said folding his arms Syl landed on his shoulder her small tempest of leaves forming into a young woman Gaz turned to him Bridge Four is down to thirty fighting members Bridge Six and Bridge Fourteen have fewer than that They each had twentynine and you just gave them both a big helping of new members And Bridge One is at thirtyseven and you sent them three new men You barely lost anyone on the last run and Kaladin caught Gazs arm as the sergeant tried to walk away Gaz flinched lifting his cudgel Try it Kaladin thought meeting Gazs eyes He almost wished that the sergeant would Gaz gritted his teeth Fine One man I pick him Kaladin said Whatever Theyre all worthless anyway Kaladin turned to the group of new bridgemen Theyd gathered into clusters by which bridge crew Gaz had put them in Kaladin immediately turned his attention to the taller men By slave standards they appeared well fed Two of them looked like theyd Hey gancho a voice said from another group Hey You want me I think Kaladin turned A short spindly man was waving to him The man had only one arm Who would assign him to be a bridgeman Hed stop an arrow Kaladin thought Thats all some bridgemen are good for in the eyes of the uppers The man had brown hair and deep tan skin just a shade too dark to be Alethi The fingernails on his hand were slatecolored and crystallinehe was a Herdazian then Most of the newcomers shared the same defeated look of apathy but this man was smiling though he wore a slaves mark on his head That mark is old Kaladin thought Either he had a kind master before this or he has somehow resisted being beaten down The man obviously didnt understand what awaited him as a bridgeman No person would smile if they understood that You can use me the man said We Herdazians are great fighters gon He pronounced that last word like gone and it appeared to refer to Kaladin You see this one time I was with sure three men and they were drunk and all but I still beat them He spoke at a very quick pace his thick accent slurring the words together Hed make a terrible bridgeman He might be able to run with the bridge on his shoulders but not maneuver it He even looked a little flabby around the waist Whatever bridge crew got him would put him right in the front and let him take an arrow then be rid of him Got ta do what you can to stay alive a voice from his past seemed to whisper Turn a liability into an advantage Tien Very well Kaladin said pointing Ill take the Herdazian at the back What Gaz said The short man sauntered up to Kaladin Thanks gancho Youll be glad you picked me Kaladin turned to walk back passing Gaz The bridge sergeant scratched his head You pushed me that hard so you could pick the onearmed runt Kaladin walked on without a word for Gaz Instead he turned to the onearmed Herdazian Why did you want to come with me You dont know anything about the different bridge crews You were only picking one the man said That means one man gets to be special the others dont Ive got a good feeling about you Its in your eyes gancho He paused Whats a bridge crew Kaladin found himself smiling at the mans nonchalant attitude Youll see Whats your name Lopen the man said Some of my cousins they call me the Lopen because they havent ever heard anyone else named that Ive asked around a lot maybe one hundredor two hundredlots of people sure And nobody has heard of that name Kaladin blinked at the torrent of words Did the man ever stop to breathe Bridge Four was taking their break their massive bridge resting on one side and giving shade The five wounded had joined them and were chatting even Leyten was up which was encouraging Hed been having a lot of trouble walking what with that crushed leg Kaladin had done what he could but the man would always have a limp The only one who didnt talk to the others was Dabbid the man who had been so profoundly shocked by battle He followed the others but he didnt talk Kaladin was starting to fear that the man would never recover from his mind fatigue Hobberthe roundfaced gaptoothed man who had taken an arrow to the legwas walking without a crutch It wouldnt be long before he could start running bridges again and a good thing too They needed every pair of hands they could get Head to the barrack there Kaladin said to Lopen Theres a blanket sandals and vest for you in the pile at the very back Sure Lopen said sauntering off He waved at a few of the men as he passed Rock walked up to Kaladin folding his arms Is new member Yes Kaladin said The only kind Gaz would give us I assume Rock sighed This thing we should have expected it He will give us only the very most useless of bridgemen from now on Kaladin was tempted to say something in the way of agreement but hesitated Syl would probably see it as a lie and that would annoy her This new way of carrying the bridge Rock said Is not very useful I think Is He cut off as a horn call blared over the camp echoing against stone buildings like the bleat of a distant greatshell Kaladin grew tense His men were on duty He waited tense until the third set of horns blew Line up Kaladin yelled Lets move Unlike the other nineteen crews on duty Kaladins men didnt scramble about in confusion but assembled in an orderly fashion Lopen dashed out wearing a vest then hesitated looking at the four squads not knowing where to go Hed be cut to ribbons if Kaladin put him in front but hed probably just slow them down anywhere else Lopen Kaladin shouted The onearmed man saluted Does he think hes actually in the military You see that rain barrel Go get some waterskins from the carpenters assistants They told me we could borrow some Fill as many as you can then catch up down below Sure gancho Lopen said Bridge up Kaladin shouted moving into position at the front Shoulder carry Bridge Four moved While some of the other bridge crews were crowded around their barracks Kaladins team charged across the lumberyard They were first down the incline and reached the first permanent bridge before the army even formed up There Kaladin ordered them to put their bridge down and wait Shortly thereafter Lopen trotted down the hillsideand surprisingly Dabbid and Hobber were with him They couldnt move fast not with Hobbers limp but they had constructed a sort of litter with a tarp and two lengths of wood Piled into the middle of it were a good twenty waterskins They trotted up to the bridge team Whats this Kaladin said You told me to bring whatever I could carry gon Lopen said Well we got this thing from the carpenters They use it to carry pieces of wood they said and they werent using it so we took it and now were here Aint that right moolie He said that last to Dabbid who just nodded Moolie Kaladin asked Means mute Lopen said shrugging Cuz he doesnt seem to talk much you see I see Well good job Bridge Four back in position Here comes the rest of the army The next few hours were what they had grown to expect from bridge runs Grueling conditions carrying the heavy bridge across plateaus The water proved a huge help The army occasionally watered the bridgemen during runs but never as often as the men needed it Being able to take a drink after crossing each plateau was as good as having a halfdozen more men But the real difference came from the practice Bridge Fours men no longer fell exhausted each time they set a bridge down The work was still difficult but their bodies were ready for it Kaladin caught more than a few glances of surprise or envy from the other bridge crews as his men laughed and joked instead of collapsing Running a bridge once a week or soas the other men didjust wasnt enough An extra meal each night combined with training had built up his mens muscles and prepared them to work The march was a long one as long as Kaladin had ever made They traveled eastward for hours That was a bad sign When they aimed for closer plateaus they often got there before the Parshendi But this far out they were racing just to prevent the Parshendi from escaping with the gemheart there was no chance theyd arrive before the enemy That meant it would probably be a difficult approach Were not ready for the side carry Kaladin thought nervously as they finally drew close to an enormous plateau rising in an unusual shape Hed heard of itthe Tower it was called No Alethi force had ever won a gemheart here They set their bridge down before the penultimate chasm positioning it and Kaladin felt a foreboding as the scouts crossed The Tower was wedgeshaped uneven with the southeastern point rising far into the air creating a steep hillside Sadeas had brought a large number of soldiers this plateau was enormous allowing the deployment of a larger force Kaladin waited anxious Maybe theyd be lucky and the Parshendi would already be gone with the gemheart It was possible this far out The scouts came charging back Enemy lines on the opposing rim They havent gotten the chrysalis open yet Kaladin groaned softly The army began to cross on his bridge and Bridge Four regarded him solemn expressions grim They knew what would come next Some of them perhaps many of them would not survive It was going to be very bad this time On previous runs theyd had a buff er When theyd lost four or five men theyd still been able to keep going Now they were running with just thirty members Every man they lost would slow them measurably and the loss of just four or five more would cause them to wobble or even topple When that happened the Parshendi would focus everything on them Hed seen it happen before If a bridge crew started to teeter the Parshendi pounced Besides when a bridge crew was visibly low on numbers it always got targeted by the Parshendi to be taken down Bridge Four was in trouble This run could easily end with fifteen or twenty deaths Something had to be done This was it Gather close Kaladin said The men frowned stepping up to him Were going to carry the bridge in side position Kaladin said softly Ill go first Im going to steer be ready to go in the direction I do Kaladin Teft said side position is slow It was an interesting idea but Do you trust me Teft Kaladin asked Well I guess The grizzled man glanced at the others Kaladin could see that many of them did not at least not fully This will work Kaladin said intently Were going to use the bridge as a shield to block arrows We need to hurry out in front faster than the other bridges Itll be hard to outrun them with the side carry but its the only thing I can think of If it doesnt work Ill be in front so Ill be the first to drop If I die move the bridge to shouldercarry Weve practiced doing that Then youll be rid of me The bridgemen were silent What if we dont want to be rid of you longfaced Natam asked Kaladin smiled Then run swiftly and follow my lead Im going to turn us unexpectedly during the run be ready to change directions He went back to the bridge The common soldiers were across and the lighteyesincluding Sadeas in his ornate Shardplatewere riding over the span Kaladin and Bridge Four followed then pulled the bridge behind them They shouldercarried it to the front of the army and put it down waiting for the other bridges to get in place Lopen and the other two watercarriers hung back with Gaz it looked like they wouldnt get into trouble for not running That was a small blessing Kaladin felt sweat bead on his forehead He could just barely make out the Parshendi ranks ahead on the other side of the chasm Men of black and crimson shortbows held at the ready arrows nocked The enormous slope of the Tower rose behind them Kaladins heart beat faster Anticipationspren sprung up around members of the army but not his team To their credit there werent any fearspren eithernot that they didnt feel fear they just werent as panicked as the other bridge crews so the fearspren went there instead Care Tukks seemed to whisper at him from the past The key to fighting isnt lack of passion its controlled passion Care about winning Care about those you defend You have to care about something I care Kaladin thought Storm me as a fool but I do Bridges up Gazs voice echoed across the front lines repeating the order given him by Lamaril Bridge Four moved quickly turning the bridge on its side and hoisting it up The shorter men made a line holding the bridge up to their right with the taller men forming a bunchedup line behind them reaching through and lifting or reaching high and steadying the bridge Lamaril gave them a harsh look and Kaladins breath caught in his throat Gaz stepped up and whispered something to Lamaril The nobleman nodded slowly and said nothing The assault call sounded Bridge Four charged From behind them arrows flew in a wave over the bridge crews heads arcing down toward the Parshendi Kaladin ran jaw clenched He had trouble keeping himself from stumbling over the rockbuds and shalebark growths Fortunately though his team was slower than normal their practice and endurance meant they were still faster than the other crews With Kaladin at their lead Bridge Four managed to get out ahead of the others That was important because Kaladin angled his team slightly to the right as if his crew were just a tad offcourse with the heavy bridge at the side The Parshendi knelt down and began to chant together Alethi arrows fell among them distracting some but the others raised bows Get ready Kaladin thought He pushed harder and felt a sudden surge of strength His legs stopped straining his breath stopped wheezing Perhaps it was the anxiety of battle perhaps it was numbness setting in but the unexpected strength gave him a slight sense of euphoria He felt as if something were buzzing within him mixing with his blood In that moment it felt like he was pulling the bridge behind him all alone like a sail towing the ship beneath it He turned farther to the right running at a deeper angle putting himself and his men in full sight of the Parshendi archers The Parshendi continued to chant somehow knowingwithout orderswhen to draw their bows They pulled arrows to marbled cheeks sighting on the bridgemen As expected many aimed at his men Almost close enough Just a few heartbeats more Now Kaladin turned sharply to the left just as the Parshendi loosed The bridge moved with him now charging with the face of the bridge pointed toward the archers Arrows flew snapping against the wood digging into it Some arrows rattled against the stone beneath their feet The bridge resounded with the impacts Kaladin heard desperate screams of pain from the other bridge crews Men fell some of them probably on their first run In Bridge Four nobody cried out Nobody fell Kaladin turned the bridge again running angled in the other direction the bridgemen exposed again The surprised Parshendi nocked arrows Normally they fired in waves That gave Kaladin an opportunity for as soon as the Parshendi got the arrows drawn he turned using the bulky bridge as a shield Again arrows snapped into the wood Again other bridge crews screamed Again Kaladins zigzagging run protected his men One more Kaladin thought This would be the tough one The Parshendi would know what he was doing Theyd be ready to fire once he turned back He turned Nobody fired Amazed he realized that the Parshendi archers had turned all of their attention to the other bridge crews seeking easier targets The space in front of Bridge Four was virtually empty The chasm was near anddespite his anglingKaladin brought his team in onmark to place their bridge in the right spot They all had to be aligned close together for cavalry charge to work Kaladin quickly gave the order to drop Some of the Parshendi archers turned their attention back but most ignored them firing their arrows at the other crews A crash from behind announced a bridge falling Kaladin and his men pushed the Alethi archers behind pelting the Parshendi to distract them and keep them from shoving the bridge back Still pushing Kaladin risked a glance over his shoulder The next bridge in line was close It was Bridge Seven but they were floundering arrow after arrow striking them cutting them down in rows They fell as he watched bridge crashing to the stones Now Bridge Twentyseven was wavering Two other bridges were already down Bridge Six had reached the chasm but just barely over half its members down Where were the other bridge crews He couldnt tell from his quick glance and had to turn back to his work Kaladins men placed their bridge with a thump and Kaladin gave the call to pull back He and his men dashed away to let the cavalry charge across But no cavalry came Sweat dripping from his brow Kaladin spun Five other bridge crews had set their bridges but others were still struggling to reach the chasm Unexpectedly theyd tried tilting their bridges to block the arrows emulating Kaladin and his team Many stumbled some men attempting to lower the bridge for protection while others still ran forward It was chaos These men hadnt practiced the side carry As one straggling crew tried to hold their bridge up in the new position they dropped it Two more bridge crews were cut down completely by the Parshendi who continued to fire Heavy cavalry charged crossing the six bridges that had been set Normally two riders abreast on each bridge added up to a mass of a hundred horsemen thirty to forty across and three ranks deep That depended on many bridges aligned in a row allowing an effective charge against the hundreds of Parshendi archers But the bridges had been set too erratically Some cavalry got across but they were scattered and couldnt ride down the Parshendi without fear of being surrounded Foot soldiers had started to help push Bridge Six into place We should go help Kaladin realized Get those other bridges across But it was too late Though Kaladin stood near the battlefield his menas was their practicehad fallen back to the nearest rock outcropping for shelter The one theyd chosen was close enough to see the battle but was well protected from arrows The Parshendi always ignored bridgemen after the initial assault though the Alethi were careful to leave rear guards to protect the landing point and watch for Parshendi trying to cut off their retreat The soldiers finally maneuvered Bridge Six into place and two more bridge crews got theirs down but half of the bridges hadnt made it The army had to reorganize on the run dashing forward to support the cavalry splitting to cross where the bridges had been set Teft left the outcropping and grabbed Kaladin by the arm tugging him back to relative safety Kaladin allowed himself to be pulled along but he still looked at the battlefield a horrible realization coming to him Rock stepped up beside Kaladin clapping him on the shoulder The large Horneaters hair was plastered to his head with sweat but he was smiling broadly Is miracle Not a single man wounded Moash stepped up beside them Stormfather I cant believe what we just did Kaladin youve changed bridge runs forever No Kaladin said softly Ive completely undermined our assault IWhat Stormfather Kaladin thought The heavy cavalry had been cut off A cavalry charge needed an unbroken line it was the intimidation as much as anything that made it work But here the Parshendi could dodge out of the way then come at the horsemen from the flanks And the foot soldiers hadnt gotten in quickly enough to help Several groups of horsemen fought completely surrounded Soldiers bunched up around the bridges that had been set trying to get across but the Parshendi had a solid foothold and were repelling them Spearmen fell from the bridges and the Parshendi then managed to topple one entire bridge into the chasm The Alethi forces were soon on the defensive the soldiers focused on holding the bridgeheads to secure an avenue of retreat for the cavalry Kaladin watched really watched Hed never studied the tactics and needs of the entire army in these assaults Hed considered only the needs of his own crew It was a foolish mistake and he should have known better He would have known better if hed still thought of himself as a real soldier He hated Sadeas he hated the way the man used bridge crews But he shouldnt have changed Bridge Fours basic tactics without considering the larger scheme of the battle I deflected attention to the other bridge crews Kaladin thought That got us to the chasm too soon and slowed some of the others And since hed run out in front many other bridgemen had gotten a good view of how hed used the bridge as a shield That had led them to emulate Bridge Four Each of the crews had ended up running at a different speed and the Alethi archers hadnt known where to focus their volleys to soften the Parshendi for the bridge landings Stormfather Ive just cost Sadeas this battle There would be repercussions The bridgemen had been forgotten while the generals and captains scrambled to revise their battle plans But once this was over they would come for him Or maybe it would happen sooner Gaz and Lamaril with a group of reserve spearmen were marching toward Bridge Four Rock stepped up beside Kaladin on one side a nervous Teft on the other holding a stone in his hands The bridgemen behind Kaladin began to mutter Stand down Kaladin said softly to Rock and Teft But Kaladin Teft said They Stand down Gather the bridgemen Get them back to the lumberyard safely if you can If any of us escape this disaster When Rock and Teft didnt back away Kaladin stepped forward The battle still raged on the Tower Sadeass groupled by the Shardbearer himselfhad managed to claim a small section of ground and were holding it doggedly Corpses piled up on both sides It wouldnt be enough Rock and Teft moved up beside Kaladin again but he stared them down forcing them back Then he turned to Gaz and Lamaril Ill point out that Gaz told me to do this he thought He suggested I use a side carry on a bridge assault But no There were no witnesses It would be his word against Gazs That wouldnt workplus that argument would leave Gaz and Lamaril with good reason to see Kaladin dead immediately before he could speak to their superiors Kaladin needed to do something else Do you have any idea what youve done Gaz sputtered as he grew near Ive upended the armys strategy Kaladin said throwing the entire assault force into chaos Youve come to punish me so that when your superiors come screaming to you for what happened you can at least show that you acted quickly to deal with the one responsible Gaz paused Lamaril and the spearmen stopping around him The bridge sergeant looked surprised If its worth anything Kaladin said grimly I didnt know this would happen I was just trying to survive Bridgemen arent supposed to survive Lamaril said curtly He waved to a pair of his soldiers then pointed at Kaladin If you leave me alive Kaladin said I promise I will tell your superiors that you had nothing to do with this If you kill me it will look like you were trying to hide something Hide something Gaz said glancing at the battle on the Tower A stray arrow clattered across the rocks a short distance from him shaft breaking What would we have to hide Depends This very well could look like it was your idea from the start Brightlord Lamaril you didnt stop me You could have but you didnt and soldiers saw Gaz and you speaking when you saw what I did If I cant vouch for your ignorance of what I was going to do then youll look very very bad Lamarils soldiers looked to their leader The lighteyed man scowled Beat him he said but dont kill him He turned and marched back toward the Alethi reserve lines The beefy spearmen walked up to Kaladin They were darkeyed but they might as well have been Parshendi for all the sympathy they would show him Kaladin closed his eyes and steeled himself He couldnt fight them all off Not and remain with Bridge Four A spear butt to the gut knocked him to the ground and he gasped as the soldiers began to kick One booted foot tore open his belt pouch His spherestoo precious to leave in the barrackscattered across the stones They had somehow lost their Stormlight and were now dun their life run out The soldiers kept kicking They changed even as we fought them Like shadows they were that can transform as the flame dances Never underestimate them because of what you first see Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin a Radiant of the Order of Stonewards The sourceGuvlows Incarnateis generally held as reliable though this is from a copied fragment of The Poem of the Seventh Morning which has been lost Sometimes when Shallan walked into the Palanaeum properthe grand storehouse of books manuscripts and scrolls beyond the study areas of the Veilshe grew so distracted by the beauty and scope of it that she forgot everything else The Palanaeum was shaped like an inverted pyramid carved down into the rock It had balcony walkways suspended around its perimeter Slanted gently downward they ran around all four walls to form a majestic square spiral a giant staircase pointing toward the center of Roshar A series of lifts provided a quicker method of descending Standing at the top levels railing Shallan could see only halfway to the bottom This place seemed too large too grand to have been shaped by the hands of men How had the terraced levels been aligned so perfectly Had Soulcasters been used to create the open spaces How many gemstones would that have taken The lighting was dim there was no general illumination only small emerald lamps focused to illuminate the walkway floors Ardents from the Devotary of Insight periodically moved through the levels changing the spheres There had to be hundreds upon hundreds of the emeralds here apparently they made up the Kharbranthian royal treasury What better place for them than the extremely secure Palanaeum Here they could both be protected and serve to illuminate the enormous library Shallan continued on her way Her parshman servant carried a sphere lantern containing a trio of sapphire marks The soft blue light reflected against the stone walls portions of which had been Soulcast into quartz purely for ornamentation The railings had been carved from wood then transformed to marble When she ran her fingers across one she could feel the original woods grain At the same time it had the cold smoothness of stone An oddity that seemed designed to confuse the senses Her parshman carried a small basket of books full of drawings by famous natural scientists Jasnah had begun allowing Shallan to spend some of her study time on topics of her own choosing Just a single hour a day but it was remarkable how precious that hour had become Recently shed been digging through Myalmrs Western Voyages The world was a wondrous place She hungered to learn more wished to observe each and every one of its creatures to have sketches of them in her books To organize Roshar by capturing it in images The books she read though wonderful all felt incomplete Each author would be good with words or with drawings but rarely both And if the author was good with both then her grasp of science would be poor There were so many holes in their understanding Holes that Shallan could fill No she told herself firmly as she walked Thats not what Im here to do It was getting harder and harder to stay focused on the theft though Jasnahas Shallan had hopedhad begun using her as a bathing attendant That might soon present the opportunity she needed And yet the more she studied the more she hungered for knowledge She led her parshman to one of the lifts There two other parshmen began lowering her Shallan eyed the basket of books She could spend her time on the lift reading maybe finish that section of Western Voyages She turned away from the basket Stay focused On the fifth level down she stepped out into the smaller walkway that connected the lift to the sloping ramps set into the walls Upon reaching the wall she turned right and continued down a little farther The wall was lined with doorways and finding the one she wanted she entered a large stone chamber filled with tall bookshelves Wait here she said to her parshman as she dug her drawing folio out of the basket She tucked it under her arm took the lantern and hurried into the stacks One could disappear for hours in the Palanaeum and never see another soul Shallan rarely saw anyone while searching out an obscure book for Jasnah There were ardents and servants to fetch volumes of course but Jasnah thought it important for Shallan to practice doing it herself Apparently the Kharbranthian filing system was now standard for many of Roshars libraries and archives At the back of the room she found a small desk of cobwood She set her lantern on one side and sat on the stool getting out her portfolio The room was silent and dark her lantern light revealing the ends of bookshelves to her right and a smooth stone wall to her left The air smelled of old paper and dust Not wet It was never damp in the Palanaeum Perhaps the dryness had something to do with the long troughs of white powder at the ends of each room She undid her portfolios leather ties Inside the top sheets were blank and the next few contained drawings shed done of people in the Palanaeum More faces for her collection Hidden in the middle was a far more important set of drawings sketches of Jasnah performing Soulcastings The princess used her Soulcaster infrequently perhaps she hesitated to use it when Shallan was around But Shallan had caught a handful of occasions mostly when Jasnah had been distracted and had apparently forgotten she wasnt alone Shallan held up one picture Jasnah sitting in the alcove hand to the side and touching a crumpled piece of notepaper a gem on her Soulcaster glowing Shallan held up the next picture It depicted the same scene just seconds later The paper had become a ball of flames It hadnt burned No it had become fire Tongues of flame coiling a flash of heat in the air What had been on it that Jasnah wished to hide Another picture showed Jasnah Soulcasting the wine in her cup into a chunk of crystal to use as a paperweight the goblet itself holding down another stack on one of the rare occasions when theyd dinedand studiedon a patio outside the Conclave There was also the one of Jasnah burning words after running out of ink When Shallan had seen her burning letters into a page shed been amazed at the Soulcasters precision It seemed that this Soulcaster was attuned to three Essences in particular Vapor Spark and Lucentia But it should be able to create any of the Ten Essences from Zephyr to Talus That last one was the most important to Shallan as Talus included stone and earth She could create new mineral deposits for her family to exploit It would work Soulcasters were very rare in Jah Keved and her familys marble jade and opal would sell at a premium They couldnt create actual gemstones with a Soulcasterthat was said to be impossiblebut they could create other deposits of near equal value Once those new deposits ran out theyd have to move to less lucrative trades That would be all right though By then theyd have paid off their debts and compensated those to whom promises had been broken House Davar would become unimportant again but would not collapse Shallan studied the pictures again The Alethi princess seemed remarkably casual about Soulcasting She held one of the most powerful artifacts in all of Roshar and she used it to create paperweights What else did she use the Soulcaster for when Shallan wasnt watching Jasnah seemed to use it less frequently in her presence now than she had at first Shallan fished in the safepouch inside her sleeve bringing out her fathers broken Soulcaster It had been sheared in two places across one of the chains and through the setting that held one of the stones She inspected it in the light lookingnot for the first timefor signs of that damage The link in the chain had been replaced perfectly and the setting reforged equally well Even knowing exactly where the cuts had been she couldnt find any flaw Unfortunately repairing only the outward defects hadnt made it functional She hefted the heavy construction of metal and chains Then she put it on looping chains around her thumb small finger and middle finger There were no gemstones in the device at present She compared the broken Soulcaster to the drawings inspecting it from all sides Yes it looked identical Shed worried about that Shallan felt her heart flutter as she regarded the broken Soulcaster Stealing from Jasnah had seemed acceptable when the princess had been a distant unknown figure A heretic presumably illtempered and demanding But what of the real Jasnah A careful scholar stern but fair with a surprising level of wisdom and insight Could Shallan really steal from her She tried to still her heart Even as a little child shed been this way She could remember her tears at fights between her parents She was not good with confrontation But shed do it For Nan Balat Tet Wikim and Asha Jushu Her brothers depended on her She pressed her hands against her thighs to keep them from shaking breathing in and out After a few minutes nerves under control she took off the damaged Soulcaster and returned it to her safepouch She gathered up her papers They might be important in discovering how to use the Soulcaster What was she going to do about that Was there a way to ask Jasnah about using a Soulcaster without arousing suspicion A light flickering through nearby bookcases startled her and she tucked away her folio It turned out to be just an old berobed female ardent shuffling with a lantern and followed by a parshman servant She didnt look in Shallans direction as she turned between two rows of shelves her lanterns light shining out through the spaces between the books Lit that waywith her figure hidden but the light streaming between the shelvesit looked as if one of the Heralds themselves were walking through the stacks Her heart racing again Shallan raised her safehand to her breast I make a terrible thief she thought with a grimace She finished gathering her things and moved through the stacks lantern held before her The head of each row was carved with symbols indicating the date the books had entered the Palanaeum That was how they were organized There were enormous cabinets filled with indexes on the top level Jasnah had sent Shallan to fetchand then reada copy of Dialogues a famous historical work on political theory However this was also the room that contained Shadows Rememberedthe book Jasnah was reading when the king had visited Shallan had later looked it up in the index It might have been reshelved by now Suddenly curious Shallan counted off the rows She stepped in and counted shelves inward Near the middle and at the bottom she found a thin red volume with a red hogshide cover Shadows Remembered Shallan set her lantern on the ground and slipped the book free feeling furtive as she flipped through the pages She was confused by what she discovered She hadnt realized this was a book of childrens stories There was no undertext commentary just a collection of tales Shallan sat down on the floor reading through the first one It was the story of a child who wandered away from his home at night and was chased by Voidbringers until he hid in a cavern beside a lake He whittled a piece of wood into a roughly human shape and sent it floating across the lake fooling the creatures into attacking and eating it instead Shallan didnt have much timeJasnah would grow suspicious if she remained down here too longbut she skimmed the rest of the stories They were all of a similar style ghost stories about spirits or Voidbringers The only commentary was at the back explaining that the author had been curious about the folktales told by common darkeyes She had spent years collecting and recording them Shadows Remembered Shallan thought would have been better off forgotten This was what Jasnah had been reading Shallan had expected Shadows Remembered to be some kind of deep philosophical discussion of a hidden historical murder Jasnah was a Veristitalian She constructed the truth of what happened in the past What kind of truth could she find in stories told to frighten disobedient darkeyed children Shallan slid the volume back in place and hurried on her way A short time later Shallan returned to the alcove to discover that her haste had been unnecessary Jasnah wasnt there Kabsal however was The youthful ardent sat at the long desk flipping through one of Shallans books on art Shallan noticed him before he saw her and she found herself smiling despite her troubles She folded her arms and adopted a dubious expression Again she asked Kabsal leaped up slapping the book closed Shallan he said his bald head reflecting the blue light of her parshmans lantern I came looking for For Jasnah Shallan said As always And yet shes never here when you come An unfortunate coincidence he said raising a hand to his forehead I am a poor judge of timing am I not And is that a basket of bread at your feet A gift for Brightness Jasnah he said From the Devotary of Insight I doubt a bread basket is going to persuade her to renounce her heresy Shallan said Perhaps if youd included jam The ardent smiled picking up the basket and pulling out a small jar of red simberry jam Of course Ive told you that Jasnah doesnt like jam Shallan said And yet you bring it anyway knowing jam to be among my favorite foods And youve done this oha dozen times in the last few months Im growing a bit transparent arent I Just a tad she said smiling Its about my soul isnt it Youre worried about me because Im apprenticed to a heretic Erwell yes Im afraid Id be insulted Shallan said But you did bring jam She smiled waving for her parshman to deposit her books and then wait beside the doorway Was it true that there were parshmen on the Shattered Plains who were fighting That seemed hard to credit Shed never known any parshman to as much as raise their voice They didnt seem bright enough for disobedience Of course some reports shed heardincluding those Jasnah had made her read when studying King Gavilars murderindicated that the Parshendi werent like other parshmen They were bigger had odd armor that grew from their skin itself and spoke far more frequently Perhaps they werent parshmen at all but some kind of distant cousin a different race entirely She sat down at the desk as Kabsal got out the bread her parshman waiting at the doorway A parshman wasnt much of a chaperone but Kabsal was an ardent which meant technically she didnt need one The bread had been purchased from a Thaylen bakery which meant it was fluffy and brown And since he was an ardent it didnt matter that jam was a feminine foodthey could enjoy it together She eyed him as he cut the bread The ardents in her fathers employ had all been crusty men or women in their later years sterneyed and impatient with children Shed never even considered that the devotaries would attract young men like Kabsal During these last few weeks shed found herself thinking of him in ways that would better have been avoided Have you considered he noted what kind of person you declare yourself to be by preferring simberry jam I wasnt aware that my taste in jams could be that significant There are those who have studied it Kabsal said slathering on the thick red jam and handing her the slice You run across some very odd books working in the Palanaeum Its not hard to conclude that perhaps everything has been studied at one time or another Hum Shallan said And simberry jam According to Palates of Personalityand before you object yes it is a real book and that is its titlea fondness for simberries indicates a spontaneous impulsive personality And also a preference for He cut off as a waddedup piece of paper bounced off his forehead He blinked Sorry Shallan said It just kind of happened Must be all that impulsiveness and spontaneity I have He smiled You disagree with the conclusions I dont know she said with a shrug Ive had people tell me they could determine my personality based on the day I was born or the position of Talns Scar on my seventh birthday or by numerological extrapolations of the tenth glyphic paradigm But I think were more complicated than that People are more complicated than the numerological extrapolations of the tenth glyphic paradigm Kabsal said spreading jam on a piece of bread for himself No wonder I have such difficulty understanding women Very funny I mean that were more complex than mere bundles of personality traits Am I spontaneous Sometimes You might describe my chasing Jasnah here to become her ward that way But before that I spent seventeen years being about as unspontaneous as someone could be In many situationsif Im encouragedmy tongue can be quite spontaneous but my actions rarely are Were all spontaneous sometimes and were all conservative sometimes So youre saying that the book is right then It says youre spontaneous youre spontaneous sometimes Ergo its correct By that argument its right about everybody One hundred percent accurate Well not one hundred percent Shallan said swallowing another bite of the sweet fluffy bread As has been noted Jasnah hates jam of all kinds Ah yes Kabsal said Shes a jam heretic too Her soul is in more danger than I had realized He grinned and took a bite of his bread Indeed Shallan said So what else does that book of yours say about meand half the worlds populationbecause of our enjoyment of foods with far too much sugar in them Well a fondness for simberry is also supposed to indicate a love of the outdoors Ah the outdoors Shallan said I visited that mythical place once It was so very long ago Ive nearly forgotten it Tell me does the sun still shine or is that just my dreamy recollection Surely your studies arent that bad Jasnah is inordinately fond of dust Shallan said I believe she thrives on it feeding off the particles like a chull crunching rockbuds And you Shallan On what do you thrive Charcoal He looked confused at first then glanced at her folio Ah yes I was surprised at how quickly your name and pictures spread through the Conclave Shallan ate the last of her bread then wiped her hands on a damp rag Kabsal had brought You make me sound like a disease She ran a finger through her red hair grimacing I guess I do have the coloring of a rash dont I Nonsense he said sternly You shouldnt say such things Brightness Its disrespectful Of myself No Of the Almighty who made you He made cremlings too Not to mentions rashes and diseases So being compared to one is actually an honor I fail to follow that logic Brightness As he created all things comparisons are meaningless Like the claims of your Palates book eh A point There are worse things to be than a disease she said idly thoughtful When you have one it reminds you that youre alive Makes you fight for what you have When the disease has run its course normal healthy life seems wonderful by comparison And would you not rather be a sense of euphoria Bringing pleasant feelings and joy to those you infect Euphoria passes It is usually brief so we spend more time longing for it than enjoying it She sighed Look what weve done Now Im depressed At least turning back to my studies will seem exciting by comparison He frowned at the books I was under the impression that you enjoyed your studies As was I Then Jasnah Kholin stomped into my life and proved that even something pleasant could become boring I see So shes a harsh mistress Actually no Shallan said Im just fond of hyperbole Im not he said Its a real bastard to spell Kabsal Sorry he said Then he glanced upward Sorry Im sure the ceiling forgives you To get the Almightys attention you might want to burn a prayer instead I owe him a few anyway Kabsal said You were saying Well Brightness Jasnah isnt a harsh mistress Shes actually everything shes said to be Brilliant beautiful mysterious Im fortunate to be her ward Kabsal nodded She is said to be a sterling woman save for one thing You mean the heresy He nodded Its not as bad for me as you think she said Shes rarely vocal about her beliefs unless provoked Shes ashamed then I doubt that Merely considerate He eyed her You neednt worry about me Shallan said Jasnah doesnt try to persuade me to abandon the devotaries Kabsal leaned forward growing more somber He was older than shea man in his midtwenties confident selfassured and earnest He was practically the only man near her age that shed ever talked to outside of her fathers careful supervision But he was also an ardent So of course nothing could come of it Could it Shallan Kabsal said gently can you not see how wehow Iwould be concerned Brightness Jasnah is a very powerful and intriguing woman We would expect her ideas to be infectious Infectious I thought you said I was the disease I never said that Yes but I pretended you did Which is virtually the same thing He frowned Brightness Shallan the ardents are worried about you The souls of the Almightys children are our responsibility Jasnah has a history of corrupting those with whom she comes in contact Really Shallan asked genuinely interested Other wards It is not my place to say We can move to another place Im firm on this point Brightness I will not speak of it Write it then Brightness he said voice taking on a suffering tone Oh all right she said sighing Well I can assure you my soul is quite well and thoroughly uninfected He sat back then cut another piece of bread She found herself studying him again but grew annoyed at her own girlish foolishness She would soon be returning to her family and he was only visiting her for reasons relating to his Calling But she truly was fond of his company He was the only one here in Kharbranth that she felt she could really talk to And he was handsome the simple clothing and shaved head only highlighted his strong features Like many young ardents he kept his beard short and neatly trimmed He spoke with a refined voice and he was so wellread Well if youre certain about your soul he said turning back to her Then perhaps I could interest you in our devotary I have a devotary The Devotary of Purity But the Devotary of Purity isnt the place for a scholar The Glory it advocates has nothing to do with your studies or your art A person doesnt need a devotary that focuses directly on their Calling It is nice when the two coincide though Shallan stifled a grimace The Devotary of Purity focused onas one might imagineteaching one to emulate the Almightys honesty and wholesomeness The ardents at the devotary hall hadnt known what to make of her fascination with art Theyd always wanted her to do sketches of things they found pure Statues of the Heralds depictions of the Double Eye Her father had chosen the devotary for her of course I just wonder if you made an informed choice Kabsal said Switching devotaries is allowed after all Yes but isnt recruitment frowned upon Ardents competing for members It is indeed frowned upon A deplorable habit But you do it anyway I curse occasionally too I hadnt noticed Youre a very curious ardent Kabsal Youd be surprised Were not nearly as stuffy a bunch as we seem Well except Brother Habsant he spends so much time staring at the rest of us He hesitated Actually now I think about it he might actually be stuffed I dont know that Ive ever seen him move Were getting distracted Werent you trying to recruit me to your devotary Yes And its not so uncommon as you think All of the devotaries engage in it We do a lot of frowning at one another for our profound lack of ethics He leaned forward again growing more serious My devotary has relatively few members as we dont have as much exposure as others So whenever someone seeking knowledge comes to the Palanaeum we take it upon ourselves to inform them Recruit them Let them see what it is they are missing He took a bite of his bread and jam In the Devotary of Purity did they teach you about the nature of the Almighty The divine prism with the ten facets representing the Heralds They touched on it she said Mostly we talked about achieving my goals ofwell purity Somewhat boring Ill admit since there wasnt much chance for impurity on my part Kabsal shook his head The Almighty gives everyone talentsand when we pick a Calling that capitalizes on them we are worshipping him in the most fundamental way A devotaryand its ardentsshould help nurture that encouraging you to set and achieve goals of excellence He waved to the books stacked on the desk This is what your devotary should be helping you with Shallan History logic science art Being honest and good is important but we should be working harder to encourage the natural talents of people rather than forcing them to adapt to the Glories and Callings we feel are most important That is a reasonable argument I guess Kabsal nodded looking thoughtful Is it any wonder a woman like Jasnah Kholin turned away from that Many devotaries encourage women to leave difficult studies of theology to the ardents If only Jasnah had been able to see the true beauty of our doctrine He smiled digging a thick book out of his bread basket I really had hoped originally to be able to show her what I mean I doubt shed react well to that Perhaps he said idly hefting the tome But to be the one who finally convinced her Brother Kabsal that sounds almost like youre seeking distinction He blushed and she realized shed said something that genuinely embarrassed him She winced cursing her tongue Yes he said I do seek distinction I shouldnt wish so badly to be the one who converts her But I do If she would just listen to my proof Proof I have real evidence that the Almighty exists Id like to see it Then she raised a finger cutting him off Not because I doubt his existence Kabsal Im just curious He smiled It will be my pleasure to explain But first would you like another slice of bread I should say no she said and avoid excess as my tutors trained me But instead Ill say yes Because of the jam Of course she said taking the bread How did your book of oracular preserves describe me Impulsive and spontaneous I can do that If it means jam He slathered a piece for her then wiped his fingers on his cloth and opened his book flipping through the pages until he reached one that had a drawing on it Shallan slid closer for a better look The picture wasnt of a person it depicted a pattern of some kind A triangular shape with three outlying wings and a peaked center Do you recognize this Kabsal asked It seemed familiar I feel that I should Its Kholinar he said The Alethi capital drawn as it would appear from above See the peaks here the ridges there It was built around the rock formation that was already there He flipped the page Heres Vedenar capital of Jah Keved This one was a hexagonal pattern Akinah A circular pattern Thaylen City A fourpointed star pattern What does it mean It is proof that the Almighty is in all things You can see him here in these cities Do you see how symmetrical they are The cities were built by men Kabsal They wanted symmetry because it is holy Yes but in each case they built around existing rock formations That doesnt mean anything Shallan said I do believe but I dont know if this is proof Wind and water can create symmetry you see it in nature all the time The men picked areas that were roughly symmetrical then designed their cities to make up for any flaws He turned to his basket again rummaging He came out withof all thingsa metal plate As she opened her mouth to ask a question he held up his finger again and set the plate down on a small wooden stand that raised it a few inches above the tabletop Kabsal sprinkled white powdery sand on the sheet of metal coating it Then he got out a bow the kind drawn across strings to make music You came prepared for this demonstration I see Shallan noted You really did want to make your case to Jasnah He smiled then drew the bow across the edge of the metal plate making it vibrate The sand hopped and bounced like tiny insects dropped onto something hot This he said is called cymatics The study of the patterns that sounds make when interacting with a physical medium As he drew the bow again the plate made a sound almost a pure note It was actually enough to draw a single musicspren which spun for a moment in the air above him then vanished Kabsal finished then gestured to the plate with a flourish So Shallan asked Kholinar he said holding up his book for comparison Shallan cocked her head The pattern in the sand looked exactly like Kholinar He dropped more sand on the plate and then drew the bow across it at another point and the sand rearranged itself Vedenar he said She compared again It was an exact match Thaylen City he said repeating the process at another spot He carefully chose another point on the plates edge and bowed it one final time Akinah Shallan proof of the Almightys existence is in the very cities we live in Look at the perfect symmetry She had to admit there was something compelling about the patterns It could be a false correlation Both caused by the same thing Yes The Almighty he said sitting Our very language is symmetrical Look at the glyphseach one can be folded in half perfectly And the alphabet too Fold any line of text down across itself and youll find symmetry Surely you know the story that both glyphs and letters came from the Dawnsingers Yes Even our names Yours is nearly perfect Shallan One letter off an ideal name for a lighteyed woman Not too holy but ever so close The original names for the ten Silver Kingdoms Alethela Valhav Shin Kak Nish Perfect symmetrical He reached forward taking her hand Its here around us Dont forget that Shallan no matter what she says I wont she said realizing how hed guided the conversation Hed said he believed her but still hed gone through his proofs It was touching and annoying at the same time She did not like condescension But then could one really blame an ardent for preaching Kabsal looked up suddenly releasing her hand I hear footsteps He stood and Shallan turned as Jasnah walked into the alcove followed by a parshman carrying a basket of books Jasnah showed no surprise at the presence of the ardent Im sorry Brightness Jasnah Shallan said standing He You are not a captive child Jasnah interrupted brusquely You are allowed visitors Just be careful to check your skin for tooth marks These types have a habit of dragging their prey out to sea with them Kabsal flushed He moved to gather up his things Jasnah waved for the parshman to place her books on the table Can that plate reproduce a cymatic pattern corresponding to Urithiru priest Or do you only have patterns for the standard four cities Kabsal looked at her obviously shocked to realize that she knew exactly what the plate was for He picked up his book Urithiru is just a fable Odd One would think that your type would be used to believing in fables His face grew redder He finished packing his things then nodded curtly to Shallan and walked hastily from the room If I may say so Brightness Shallan said that was exceptionally rude of you Im prone to such bouts of incivility Jasnah said Im certain he has heard what Im like I simply wanted to make sure he got what he expected You havent acted that way toward other ardents in the Palanaeum The other ardents in the Palanaeum havent been working to turn my ward against me He wasnt Shallan trailed off He was simply worried about my soul Has he asked you to try to steal my Soulcaster yet Shallan felt a sudden spike of shock Her hand went to the pouch at her waist Did Jasnah know No Shallan told herself No listen to the question He didnt Watch Jasnah said opening a book He will eventually Ive experience with his type She looked at Shallan and her expression softened Hes not interested in you Not in any of the ways you think In particular this isnt about your soul Its about me That is somewhat arrogant of you Shallan said dont you think Only if Im wrong child Jasnah said turning back to her book And I rarely am I walked from Abamabar to Urithiru This quote from the Eighth Parable of The Way of Kings seems to contradict Varala and Sinbian who both claim the city was inaccessible by foot Perhaps there was a way constructed or perhaps Nohadon was being metaphorical Bridgemen arent supposed to survive Kaladins mind felt fuzzy He knew that he hurt but other than that he floated As if his head were detached from his body and bouncing off the walls and ceilings Kaladin a concerned voice whispered Kaladin please Please dont be hurt anymore Bridgemen arent supposed to survive Why did those words bother him so much He remembered what had happened using the bridge as a shield throwing the army off dooming the assault Stormfather he thought Im an idiot Kaladin It was Syls voice He risked opening his eyes and looked out on an upsidedown world sky extending below him familiar lumberyard in the air above him No He was upside down Hanging against the side of Bridge Fours barrack The Soulcast building was fifteen feet tall at its peak with a shallowly slanted roof Kaladin was tied by his ankles to a rope which wouldin turnbe affixed to a ring set into the slanted roof Hed seen it happen to other bridgemen One who had committed a murder in camp another who had been caught stealing for the fifth time His back was to the wall so that he faced eastward His arms were free hanging down at his sides and they almost touched the ground He groaned again hurting everywhere As his father had trained him he began to prod his side to check for broken ribs He winced as he found several that were tender at least cracked Probably broken He felt at his shoulder too where he feared that his collarbone was broken One of his eyes was swollen Time would show if hed sustained any serious internal damage He rubbed his face and flakes of dried blood cracked free and fluttered toward the ground Gash on his head bloodied nose split lip Syl landed on his chest feet planted on his sternum hands clasped before her Kaladin Im alive he mumbled words slurred by his swollen lip What happened You were beaten by those soldiers she said seeming to grow smaller Ive gotten back at them I made one of them trip three times today She looked concerned He found himself smiling How long could a man hang like this blood going to his head There was a lot of yelling Syl said softly I think several men were demoted The soldier Lamaril he What He was executed Syl said even more quietly Highprince Sadeas did it himself the hour the army got back from the plateau He said something about the ultimate responsibility falling on the lighteyes Lamaril kept screaming that you had promised to absolve him and that Gaz should be punished instead Kaladin smirked ruefully He shouldnt have had me beaten senseless Gaz They left him in his position I dont know why Right of responsibility In a disaster like this the lighteyes are supposed to take most of the blame They like to make a show of obeying old precepts like that when it suits them Why am I still alive Something about an example Syl said wrapping her translucent arms around herself Kaladin I feel cold You can feel temperature Kaladin said coughing Not usually I can now I dont understand it II dont like it Itll be all right You shouldnt lie Sometimes its all right to lie Syl And this is one of those times He blinked trying to ignore his wounds the pressure in his head trying to clear his mind He failed on all counts Yes he whispered I think I understand So Kaladin said resting his head back the parietal knob of his skull resting against the wall Im to be judged by the highstorm Theyll let the storm kill me Hanging here Kaladin would be exposed directly to the winds and everything they would throw at him If you were prudent and took appropriate action it was possible to survive outside in a highstorm though it was a miserable experience Kaladin had done it on several occasions hunkered down taking shelter in the lee of a rock formation But hanging on a wall facing directly stormward Hed be cut to ribbons and crushed by stones Ill be right back Syl said dropping off his chest taking the form of a falling stone then changing into windblown leaves near the ground and fluttering away curving to the right The lumberyard was empty Kaladin could smell the crisp chill air the land bracing for a highstorm The lull it was called when the wind fell still the air cold the pressure dropping the humidity rising right before a storm A few seconds later Rock poked his head around the wall Syl on his shoulder He crept up to Kaladin a nervous Teft following They were joined by Moash despite the latters protests that he didnt trust Kaladin he looked almost as concerned as the other two Lordling Moash said You awake Im conscious Kaladin croaked Everyone get back from the battle all right All of our men sure enough Teft said scratching at his beard But we lost the battle It was a disaster Over two hundred bridgemen dead Those who survived were only enough to carry eleven bridges Two hundred men Kaladin thought Thats my fault I protected my own at the cost of others I was too hasty Bridgemen arent supposed to survive Theres something about that He wouldnt be able to ask Lamaril That man had gotten what he deserved though If Kaladin had the ability to choose such would be the end of all lighteyes the king included We wanted to say something Rock said Is from all of the men Most wouldnt come out Highstorm coming and Its all right Kaladin whispered Teft nudged Rock to continue Well is this We will remember you Bridge Four we wont go back to how we were Maybe all of us will die but well show the new ones Fires at night Laughter Living Well make a tradition out of it For you Rock and Teft knew about the knobweed They could keep earning extra money to pay for things You did this for us Moash put in Wed have died on that field Perhaps as many as died in the other bridge crews This way were only going to lose one I say it isnt right what theyre doing Teft said with a scowl We talked about cutting you down No Kaladin said That would only earn you a similar punishment The three men shared glances It seemed theyd come to the same conclusion What did Sadeas say Kaladin asked About me That he understood how a bridgeman would want to save his life Teft said even at others expense He called you a selfish coward but acted like that was all that could be expected He says hes letting the Stormfather judge you Moash added Jezerezeh king of Heralds He says that if you deserve to live you will He trailed off He knew as well as the others that unprotected men didnt survive highstorms not like this I want you three to do something for me Kaladin said closing his eyes against the blood trickling down his face from his lip which hed cracked open by speaking Anything Kaladin Rock said I want you to go back into the barrack and tell the men to come out after the storm Tell them to look up at me tied here Tell them Ill open my eyes and look back at them and theyll know that I survived The three bridgemen fell silent Yes of course Kaladin Teft said Well do it Tell them Kaladin continued voice firmer that it wont end here Tell them I chose not to take my own life and so theres no way in Damnation Im going to give it up to Sadeas Rock smiled one of those broad smiles of his By the ulitekanaki Kaladin I almost believe youll do it Here Teft said handing him something For luck Kaladin took the object in a weak bloodstained hand It was a sphere a full skymark It was dun the Stormlight gone from it Carry a sphere with you into the storm the old saying said and at least youll have light by which to see Its all we were able to save from your pouch Teft said Gaz and Lamaril got the rest We complained but what were we to do Thank you Kaladin said Moash and Rock retreated to the safety of the barrack Syl leaving Rocks shoulder to stay with Kaladin Teft lingered too as if thinking to spend the storm with Kaladin He eventually shook his head muttering and joined the others Kaladin thought he heard the man calling himself a coward The door to the barrack shut Kaladin fingered the smooth glass sphere The sky was darkening and not just because the sun was setting Blackness gathered The highstorm Syl walked up the side of the wall then sat down on it looking at him tiny face somber You told them youd survive What happens if you dont Kaladins head was pounding with his pulse My mother would cringe if she knew how quickly the other soldiers taught me to gamble First night in Amarams army and they had me playing for spheres Kaladin Syl said Sorry Kaladin said rocking his head from side to side What you said it reminded me of that night Theres a term in gambling you see In for all they say Its when you put all of your money on one bet I dont understand Im putting it all on the long bet Kaladin whispered If I die then theyll come out shake their heads and tell themselves they knew it would happen But if I live theyll remember it And it will give them hope They might see it as a miracle Syl was silent for a moment Do you want to be a miracle No Kaladin whispered But for them I will be It was a desperate foolish hope The eastern horizon inverted in his sight was growing darker From this perspective the storm was like the shadow of some enormous beast lumbering across the ground He felt the disturbing fuzziness of a person who had been hit too hard on the head Concussion That was what it was called He was having trouble thinking but he didnt want to fall unconscious He wanted to stare at the highstorm straight on though it terrified him He felt the same panic hed felt looking down into the black chasm back when hed nearly killed himself It was the fear of what he could not see what he could not know The stormwall approached the visible curtain of rain and wind at the advent of a highstorm It was a massive wave of water dirt and rocks hundreds of feet high thousands upon thousands of windspren zipping before it In battle hed been able to fight his way to safety with the skill of his spear When hed stepped to the edge of the chasm there had been a line of retreat This time there was nothing No way to fight or avoid that black beast that shadow spanning the entirety of the horizon plunging the world into an early night The eastern edge of the crater that made the warcamp had been worn away and Bridge Fours barrack was first in its row There was nothing between him and the Plains Nothing between him and the storm Staring at that raging blustering churning wave of windpushed water and debris Kaladin felt as if he were watching the end of the world descend upon him He took a deep breath the pain of his ribs forgotten as the stormwall crossed the lumberyard in a flash and slammed into him Though many wished Urithiru to be built in Alethela it was obvious that it could not be And so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward in the place nearest to Honor Perhaps the oldest surviving original source mentioning the city requoted in The Vavibrar line 1804 What I wouldnt give for a way to translate the Dawnchant The force of the stormwall nearly knocked him unconscious but the sudden chill of it shocked him lucid For a moment Kaladin couldnt feel anything but that coldness He was pressed against the side of the barrack by the extended blast of water Rocks and bits of branch crashed against the stone around him he was already too numb to tell how many slashed or beat against his skin He bore it dazed eyes pressed shut and breath held Then the stormwall passed crashing onward The next blast of wind came in from the sidethe air was swirling and gusting from all directions now The wind flung him sidewayshis back scraping against stoneand up into the air The wind stabilized blowing out of the east again Kaladin hung in darkness and his feet yanked against the rope In a panic he realized that he was now flapping in the wind like a kite tied to the ring in the barracks slanted roof Only that rope kept him from being blown along with the other debris to be tumbled and tossed before the storm across the entirety of Roshar For those few heartbeats he could not think He could only feel the panic and the coldone boiling out of his chest the other trying to freeze him from the skin inward He screamed clutching his single sphere as if it were a lifeline The scream was a mistake as it let that coldness course into his mouth Like a spirit forcing its arm down his throat The wind was like a maelstrom chaotic moving in different directions One buff et ripped at him then passed and he fell to the roof of the barrack with a thud Almost immediately the terrible winds tried to lift him again pounding his skin with waves of icy water Thunder crashed the heartbeat of the beast that had swallowed him Lighting split the darkness like white teeth in the night The wind was so loud it nearly drowned out the thunder howling and moaning Grab the roof Kaladin Syls voice So soft so small How could he hear it at all Numbly he realized he was lying facedown on the sloped roof It wasnt so steeply peaked that he was immediately pitched off and the wind was generally blowing him backward He did as Syl said grabbing the lip of the roof with cold slick fingers Then he lay facedown head tucked between his arms He still had the sphere in his hand pressed against the stone rooftop His fingers started to slip The wind was blowing so hard trying to push him to the west If he let go hed end up dangling in the air again His rope tether was not long enough for him to get to the other side of the shallowpeaked rooftop where hed be sheltered A boulder hit the roof beside himhe couldnt hear its impact or see it in the tempests darkness but he could feel the building vibrate The boulder rolled forward and crashed down to the ground The entire storm didnt have such force but occasional gusts could pick up and toss large objects hurling them hundreds of feet His fingers slipped further The ring Syl whispered The ring The rope tied his legs to a steel ring on the side of the roof behind him Kaladin let go then snatched the ring as he was blown backward He clutched to it The rope continued down to his ankles about the length of his body He thought for a moment of untying the ropes but he didnt dare let go of the ring He clung there like a pennant flapping in the wind holding the ring in both hands sphere cupped inside one of them and pressed against the steel Each moment was a struggle The wind yanked him left then hurled him right He couldnt know how long it lasted time had no meaning in this place of fury and tumult His numbed battered mind started to think he was in a nightmare A terrible dream inside his head full of black living winds Screams in the air bright and white the flash of lightning revealing a terrible twisted world of chaos and terror The very buildings seemed blown sideways the entire world askew warped by the storms terrible power In those brief moments of light when he dared to look he thought he saw Syl standing in front of him her face to the wind tiny hands forward As if she were trying to hold back the storm and split the winds as a stone divided the waters of a swift stream The cold of the rainwater numbed the scrapes and bruises But it also numbed his fingers He didnt feel them slipping The next he knew he was whipping in the air again tossed to the side being slammed down against the roof of the barrack He hit hard His vision flashed with sparkling lights that melded together and were followed by blackness Not unconsciousness blackness Kaladin blinked All was still The storm was quiet and everything was purely dark Im dead he thought immediately But why could he feel the wet stone roof beneath him He shook his head dripping rainwater down his face There was no lightning no wind no rain The silence was unnatural He stumbled to his feet managing to stand on the gently sloped roof The stone was slick beneath his toes He couldnt feel his wounds The pain just wasnt there He opened his mouth to call out into the darkness but hesitated That silence was not to be broken The air itself seemed to weigh less as did he He almost felt as if he could float away In that darkness an enormous face appeared just in front of his A face of blackness yet faintly traced in the dark It was wide the breadth of a massive thunderhead and extended far to either side yet it was somehow still visible to Kaladin Inhuman Smiling Kaladin felt a deep chilla rolling prickle of icescurry down his spine and through his entire body The sphere suddenly burst to life in his hand flaring with a sapphire glow It illuminated the stone roof beneath him making his fist blaze with blue fire His shirt was in tatters his skin lacerated He looked down at himself shocked then looked up at the face It was gone There was only the darkness Lightning flashed and Kaladins pains returned He gasped falling to his knees before the rain and the wind He slipped down face hitting the rooftop What had that been A vision A delusion His strength was fleeing him his thoughts growing muddled again The winds werent as strong now but the rain was still so cold Lethargic confused nearly overwhelmed by his pain he brought his hand up to the side and looked at the sphere It was glowing Smeared with his blood and glowing He hurt so much and his strength had faded Closing his eyes he felt himself enveloped by a second blackness The blackness of unconsciousness Rock was the first to the door when the highstorm subsided Teft followed more slowly groaning to himself His knees hurt His knees always hurt near a storm His grandfather had complained about that in his later years and Teft had called him daft Now he felt it too Storming Damnation he thought wearily stepping outside It was still raining of course These were the afterflurries of drizzle that trailed a highstorm the riddens A few rainspren sat in puddles like blue candles and a few windspren danced in the stormwinds The rain was cold and he splashed through puddles that soaked his sandaled feet chilling them straight through the skin and muscle He hated being wet But then he hated a lot of things For a while life had been looking up Not now How did everything go so wrong so quickly he thought holding his arms close walking slowly and watching his feet Some soldiers had left their barracks and stood nearby wearing raincloaks watching Probably to make certain nobody had snuck out to cut Kaladin down early They didnt try to stop Rock though The storm had passed Rock charged around the side of the building Other bridgemen left the barrack behind as Teft followed Rock Storming Horneater Like a big lumbering chull He actually believed He thought theyd find that foolish young bridgeleader alive Probably figured theyd discover him having a nice cup of tea relaxing in the shade with the Stormfather himself And you dont believe Teft asked himself still looking down If you dont why are you following But if you did believe youd look You wouldnt stare at your feet Youd look up and see Could a man both believe and not believe at the same time Teft stopped beside Rock andsteeling himselflooked up at the wall of the barrack There he saw what hed expected and what hed feared The corpse looked like a hunk of slaughter house meat skinned and bled Was that a person Kaladins skin was sliced in a hundred places dribbles of blood mixing with rainwater running down the side of the building The lads body still hung by the ankles His shirt had been ripped off his bridgeman trousers were ragged Ironically his face was cleaner now than when theyd left him washed by the storm Teft had seen enough dead men on the battlefield to know what he was looking at Poor lad he thought shaking his head as the rest of Bridge Four gathered around him and Rock quiet horrified You almost made me believe in you Kaladins eyes snapped open The gathered bridgemen gasped several cursing and falling to the ground splashing in the pools of rainwater Kaladin drew in a ragged breath wheezing eyes staring forward intense and unseeing He exhaled blowing flecks of bloody spittle out over his lips His hand hanging below him slipped open Something dropped to the stones The sphere Teft had given him It splashed into a puddle and stopped there It was dun no Stormlight in it What in the name of Kelek Teft thought kneeling You left a sphere out in the storm and it gathered Stormlight Held in Kaladins hand this one should have been fully infused What had gone wrong Umalakaiki Rock bellowed pointing Kama mohoray namavau He stopped realizing he was speaking the wrong language Somebody be helping me get him down Is still alive We need ladder and knife Hurry The bridgemen scrambled The soldiers approached muttering but they didnt stop the bridgemen Sadeas himself had declared that the Stormfather would choose Kaladins fate Everyone knew that meant death ExceptTeft stood up straight holding the dun sphere An empty sphere after a storm he thought And a man whos still alive when he should be dead Two impossibilities Together they bespoke something that should be even more impossible Wheres that ladder Teft found himself yelling Curse you all hurry hurry We need to get him bandaged Somebody go fetch that salve he always puts on wounds He glanced back at Kaladin then spoke much more softly And youd better survive son Because I want some answers Taking the Dawnshard known to bind any creature voidish or mortal he crawled up the steps crafted for Heralds ten strides tall apiece toward the grand temple above From The Poem of Ista I have found no modern explanation of what these Dawnshards are They seem ignored by scholars though talk of them was obviously prevalent among those recording the early mythologies It was not uncommon for us to meet native peoples while traveling through the Unclaimed Hills Shallan read These ancient lands were once one of the Silver Kingdoms after all One must wonder if the greatshelled beasts lived among them back then or if the creatures have come to inhabit the wilderness left by humankinds passing She settled back in her chair the humid air warm around her To her left Jasnah Kholin floated quietly in the pool inset in the floor of the bathing chamber Jasnah liked to soak in the bath and Shallan couldnt blame her During most of Shallans life bathing had been an ordeal involving dozens of parshmen carting heated buckets of water followed by a quick scrub in the brass tub before the water cooled Kharbranths palace offered far more luxury The stone pool in the ground resembled a small personal lake luxuriously warmed by clever fabrials that produced heat Shallan didnt know much about fabrials yet though part of her was very intrigued This type was becoming increasingly common Just the other day the Conclave staff had sent Jasnah one to heat her chambers The water didnt have to be carried in but came out of pipes At the turn of a lever water flowed in It was warm when it entered and was kept heated by the fabrials set into the sides of the pool Shallan had bathed in the chamber herself and it was absolutely marvelous The practical decor was of rock decorated with small colorful stones set in mortar up the sides of the walls Shallan sat beside the pool fully dressed reading as she waited on Jasnahs needs The book was Gavilars accountas spoken to Jasnah herself years agoafter his first meeting with the strange parshmen later known as the Parshendi Occasionally during our explorations wed meet with natives she read Not parshmen Natan people with their pale bluish skin wide noses and woollike white hair In exchange for gifts of food they would point us to the hunting grounds of greatshells Then we met the parshmen Id been on a halfdozen expeditions to Natanatan but never had I seen anything like this Parshmen living on their own All logic experience and science declared that to be an impossibility Parshmen need the hand of civilized peoples to guide them This has been proven time and time again Leave one out in the wilderness and it will just sit there doing nothing until someone comes along to give it orders Yet here was a group who could hunt make weapons build buildings andindeedcreate their own civilization We soon realized that this single discovery could expand perhaps overthrow all we understood about our gentle servants Shallan moved her eyes down to the bottom of the page whereseparated by a linethe undertext was written in a small cramped script Most books dictated by men had an undertext notes added by the woman or ardent who scribed the book By unspoken agreement the undertext was never shared out loud Here a wife would sometimes clarifyor even contradictthe account of her husband The only way to preserve such honesty for future scholars was to maintain the sanctity and secrecy of the writing It should be noted Jasnah had written in the undertext to this passage that I have adapted my fathers wordsby his own instructionto make them more appropriate for recording That meant she made his dictation sound more scholarly and impressive In addition by most accounts King Gavilar originally ignored these strange selfsufficient parshmen It was only after explanation by his scholars and scribes that he understood the import of what hed discovered This inclusion is not meant to highlight my fathers ignorance he was and is a warrior His attention was not on the anthropological import of our expedition but upon the hunt that was to be its culmination Shallan closed the cover thoughtful The volume was from Jasnahs own collectionthe Palanaeum had several copies but Shallan wasnt allowed to bring the Palanaeums books into a bathing chamber Jasnahs clothing lay on a bench at the side of the room Atop the folded garments a small golden pouch held the Soulcaster Shallan glanced at Jasnah The princess floated faceup in the pool black hair fanning out behind her in the water her eyes closed Her daily bath was the one time she seemed to relax completely She looked much younger now stripped of both clothing and intensity floating like a child resting after a day of active swimming Thirtyfour years old That seemed ancient in some regardssome women Jasnahs age had children as old as Shallan And yet it was also young Young enough that Jasnah was praised for her beauty young enough that men declared it a shame she wasnt yet married Shallan glanced at the pile of clothing She carried the broken fabrial in her safepouch She could swap them here and now It was the opportunity shed been waiting for Jasnah now trusted her enough to relax soaking in the bathing chamber without worrying about her fabrial Could Shallan really do it Could she betray this woman who had taken her in Considering what Ive done before she thought this is nothing It wouldnt be the first time she betrayed someone who trusted her She stood up To the side Jasnah cracked an eye Blast Shallan thought tucking the book under her arm pacing trying to look thoughtful Jasnah watched her Not suspiciously Curiously Why did your father want to make a treaty with the Parshendi Shallan found herself asking as she walked Why wouldnt he want to Thats not an answer Of course it is Its just not one that tells you anything It would help Brightness if you would give me a useful answer Then ask a useful question Shallan set her jaw What did the Parshendi have that King Gavilar wanted Jasnah smiled closing her eyes again Closer But you can probably guess the answer to that Shards Jasnah nodded still relaxed in the water The text doesnt mention them Shallan said My father didnt speak of them Jasnah said But from things he saidwell I now suspect that they motivated the treaty Can you be sure he knew though Maybe he just wanted the gemhearts Perhaps Jasnah said The Parshendi seemed amused at our interest in the gemstones woven into their beards She smiled You should have seen our shock when we discovered where theyd gotten them When the lanceryn died off during the scouring of Aimia we thought wed seen the last gemhearts of large size And yet here was another greatshelled beast with them living in a land not too distant from Kholinar itself Anyway the Parshendi were willing to share them with us so long as they could still hunt them too To them if you took the trouble to hunt the chasmfiends their gemhearts were yours I doubt a treaty would have been needed for that And yet just before leaving to return to Alethkar my father suddenly began talking fervently of the need for an agreement So what happened What changed I cant be certain However he once described the strange actions of a Parshendi warrior during a chasmfiend hunt Instead of reaching for his spear when the greatshell appeared this man held his hand to the side in a very suspicious way Only my father saw it I suspected he believed the man planned to summon a Blade The Parshendi realized what he was doing and stopped himself My father didnt speak of it further and I assume he didnt want the worlds eyes on the Shattered Plains any more than they already were Shallan tapped her book It seems tenuous If he was sure about the Blades he must have seen more I suspect so as well But I studied the treaty carefully after his death The clauses for favored trade status and mutual border crossing could very well have been a step toward folding the Parshendi into Alethkar as a nation It certainly would have prevented the Parshendi from trading their Shards to other kingdoms without coming to us first Perhaps that was all he wanted to do But why kill him Shallan said arms crossed strolling in the direction of Jasnahs folded clothing Did the Parshendi realize that he intended to have their Shardblades and so struck at him preemptively Uncertain Jasnah said She sounded skeptical Why did she think the Parshendi killed Gavilar Shallan nearly asked but she had a feeling she wouldnt get any more out of Jasnah The woman expected Shallan to think discover and draw conclusions on her own Shallan stopped beside the bench The pouch holding the Soulcaster was open the drawstrings loose She could see the precious artifact curled up inside The swap would be easy She had used a large chunk of her money to buy gemstones that matched Jasnahs and had put them into the broken Soulcaster The two were now exactly identical She still hadnt learned anything about using the fabrial shed tried to find a way to ask but Jasnah avoided speaking of the Soulcaster Pushing harder would be suspicious Shallan would have to get information elsewhere Perhaps from Kabsal or maybe from a book in the Palanaeum Regardless the time was upon her Shallan found her hand going to her safepouch and she felt inside of it running her fingers along the chains of her broken fabrial Her heart beat faster She glanced at Jasnah but the woman was just lying there floating eyes closed What if she opened her eyes Dont think of that Shallan told herself Just do it Make the swap Its so close You are progressing more quickly than I had assumed you would Jasnah said suddenly Shallan spun but Jasnahs eyes were still closed I was wrong to judge you so harshly because of your prior education I myself have often said that passion outperforms upbringing You have the determination and the capacity to become a respected scholar Shallan I realize that the answers seem slow in coming but continue your research You will have them eventually Shallan stood for a moment hand in her pouch heart thumping uncontrollably She felt sick I cant do it she realized Stormfather but Im a fool I came all of this wayand now I cant do it She pulled her hand from her pouch and stalked back across the bathing chamber to her chair What was she going to tell her brothers Had she just doomed her family She sat down setting her book aside and sighing prompting Jasnah to open her eyes Jasnah watched her then righted herself in the water and gestured for the hairsoap Gritting her teeth Shallan stood up and fetched the soap tray for Jasnah bringing it over and squatting down to proffer it Jasnah took the powdery hairsoap and mashed it in her hand lathering it before putting it into her sleek black hair with both hands Even naked Jasnah Kholin was composed and in control Perhaps we have spent too much time indoors of late the princess said You look penned up Shallan Anxious Im fine Shallan said brusquely Hum yes As evidenced by your perfectly reasonable relaxed tone Perhaps we need to shift some of your training from history to something more handson more visceral Like natural science Shallan asked perking up Jasnah tilted her head back Shallan knelt down on a towel beside the pool then reached down with her freehand massaging the soap into her mistresss lush tresses I was thinking philosophy Jasnah said Shallan blinked Philosophy What good is that Isnt it the art of saying nothing with as many words as possible Philosophy is an important field of study Jasnah said sternly Particularly if youre going to be involved in court politics The nature of morality must be considered and preferably before one is exposed to situations where a moral decision is required Yes Brightness Though I fail to see how philosophy is more handson than history History by definition can not be experienced directly As it is happening it is the present and that is philosophys realm Thats just a matter of definition Yes Jasnah said all words have a tendency to be subject to how they are defined I suppose Shallan said leaning back letting Jasnah dunk her hair to clean off the soap The princess began scrubbing her skin with mildly abrasive soap That was a particularly bland response Shallan What happened to your wit Shallan glanced at the bench and its precious fabrial After all this time she had proven too weak to do what needed to be done My wit is on temporary hiatus Brightness she said Pending review by its colleagues sincerity and temerity Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her Shallan sat back on her heels still kneeling on the towel How do you know what is right Jasnah If you dont listen to the devotaries how do you decide That depends upon ones philosophy What is most important to you I dont know Cant you tell me No Jasnah replied If I gave you the answers Id be no better than the devotaries prescribing beliefs They arent evil Jasnah Except when they try to rule the world Shallan drew her lips into a thin line The War of Loss had destroyed the Hierocracy shattering Vorinism into the devotaries That was the inevitable result of a religion trying to rule The devotaries were to teach morals not enforce them Enforcement was for the lighteyes You say you cant give me answers Shallan said But cant I ask for the advice of someone wise Someone whos gone before Why write our philosophies draw our conclusions if not to influence others You yourself told me that information is worthless unless we use it to make judgments Jasnah smiled dunking her arms and washing off the soap Shallan caught a victorious glimmer in her eye She wasnt necessarily advocating ideas because she believed them she just wanted to push Shallan It was infuriating How was Shallan to know what Jasnah really thought if she adopted conflicting points of view like this You act as if there were one answer Jasnah said gesturing to Shallan to fetch a towel and climbing from the pool A single eternally perfect response Shallan hastily complied bearing a large fluffy towel Isnt that what philosophy is about Finding the answers Seeking the truth the real meaning of things Toweling off Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her What Shallan asked suddenly selfconscious I believe it is time for a field exercise Jasnah said Outside of the Palanaeum Now Shallan asked Its so late I told you philosophy was a handson art Jasnah said wrapping the towel around herself then reaching down and taking the Soulcaster out of its pouch She slipped the chains around her fingers securing the gemstones to the back of her hand Ill prove it to you Come help me dress As a child Shallan had relished those evenings when shed been able to slip away into the gardens When the blanket of darkness rested atop the grounds they had seemed a different place entirely In those shadows shed been able to imagine that the rockbuds shalebark and trees were some foreign fauna The scrapings of cremlings climbing out of cracks had become the footsteps of mysterious people from faroff lands Largeeyed traders from Shinovar a greatshell rider from Kadrix or a narrowboat sailor from the Purelake She didnt have those same imaginings when walking Kharbranth at night Imagining dark wanderers in the night had once been an intriguing gamebut here dark wanderers were likely to be real Instead of becoming a mysterious intriguing place at night Kharbranth seemed much the same to herjust more dangerous Jasnah ignored the calls of rickshaw pullers and palanquin porters She walked slowly in a beautiful dress of violet and gold Shallan following in blue silk Jasnah hadnt taken time to have her hair done following her bath and she wore it loose cascading across her shoulders almost scandalous in its freedom They walked the Ralinsathe main thoroughfare that led down the hillside in switchbacks connecting Conclave and port Despite the late hour the roadway was crowded and many of the men who walked here seemed to bear the night inside of them They were gruff er more shadowed of face Shouts still rang through the city but those carried the night in them too measured by the roughness of their words and the sharpness of their tones The steep slanted hillside that formed the city was no less crowded with buildings than always yet these too seemed to draw in the night Blackened like stones burned by a fire Hollow remains The bells still rang In the darkness each ring was a tiny scream They made the wind more present a living thing that caused a chiming cacophony each time it passed A breeze rose and an avalanche of sound came tumbling across the Ralinsa Shallan nearly found herself ducking before it Brightness Shallan said Shouldnt we call for a palanquin A palanquin might inhibit the lesson Ill be all right learning that lesson during the day if you wouldnt mind Jasnah stopped looking off the Ralinsa and toward a darker side street What do you think of that roadway Shallan It doesnt look particularly appealing to me And yet Jasnah said it is the most direct route from the Ralinsa to the theater district Is that where were going We arent going anywhere Jasnah said taking off down the side street We are acting pondering and learning Shallan followed nervously The night swallowed them only the occasional light from latenight taverns and shops offered illumination Jasnah wore her black fingerless glove over her Soulcaster hiding the light of its gemstones Shallan found herself creeping Her slippered feet could feel every change in the ground underfoot each pebble and crack She looked about nervously as they passed a group of workers gathered around a tavern doorway They were darkeyes of course In the night that distinction seemed more profound Brightness Shallan asked in a hushed tone When we are young Jasnah said we want simple answers There is no greater indication of youth perhaps than the desire for everything to be as it should As it has ever been Shallan frowned still watching the men by the tavern over her shoulder The older we grow Jasnah said the more we question We begin to ask why And yet we still want the answers to be simple We assume that the people around usadults leaderswill have those answers Whatever they give often satisfies us I was never satisfied Shallan said softly I wanted more You were mature Jasnah said What you describe happens to most of us as we age Indeed it seems to me that aging wisdom and wondering are synonymous The older we grow the more likely we are to reject the simple answers Unless someone gets in our way and demands they be accepted regardless Jasnahs eyes narrowed You wonder why I reject the devotaries I do Most of them seek to stop the questions Jasnah halted Then she briefly pulled back her glove using the light beneath to reveal the street around her The gemstones on her handlarger than broamsblazed like torches red white and grey Is it wise to be showing your wealth like that Brightness Shallan said speaking very softly and glancing about her No Jasnah said It is most certainly not Particularly not here You see this street has gained a particular reputation lately On three separate occasions during the last two months theatergoers who chose this route to the main road were accosted by footpads In each case the people were murdered Shallan felt herself grow pale The city watch Jasnah said has done nothing Taravangian has sent them several pointed reprimands but the captain of the watch is cousin to a very influential lighteyes in the city and Taravangian is not a terribly powerful king Some suspect that there is more going on that the footpads might be bribing the watch The politics of it are irrelevant at the moment for as you can see no members of the watch are guarding the place despite its reputation Jasnah pulled her glove back on plunging the roadway back into darkness Shallan blinked her eyes adjusting How foolish Jasnah said would you say it is for us to come here two undefended women wearing costly clothing and bearing riches Very foolish Jasnah can we go Please Whatever lesson you have in mind isnt worth this Jasnah drew her lips into a line then looked toward a narrow darker alleyway off the road they were on It was almost completely black now that Jasnah had replaced her glove Youre at an interesting place in your life Shallan Jasnah said flexing her hand You are old enough to wonder to ask to reject what is presented to you simply because it was presented to you But you also cling to the idealism of youth You feel there must be some single alldefining Truthand you think that once you find it all that once confused you will suddenly make sense I Shallan wanted to argue but Jasnahs words were tellingly accurate The terrible things Shallan had done the terrible thing she had planned to do haunted her Was it possible to do something horrible in the name of accomplishing something wonderful Jasnah walked into the narrow alleyway Jasnah Shallan said What are you doing This is philosophy in action child Jasnah said Come with me Shallan hesitated at the mouth of the alleyway her heart thumping her thoughts muddled The wind blew and bells rang like frozen raindrops shattering against the stones In a moment of decision she rushed after Jasnah preferring company even in the dark to being alone The shrouded glimmer of the Soulcaster was barely enough to light their way and Shallan followed in Jasnahs shadow Noise from behind Shallan turned with a start to see several dark forms crowding into the alley Oh Stormfather she whispered Why Why was Jasnah doing this Shaking Shallan grabbed at Jasnahs dress with her freehand Other shadows were moving in front of them from the far side of the alley They grew closer grunting splashing through foul stagnant puddles Chill water had already soaked Shallans slippers Jasnah stopped moving The frail light of her cloaked Soulcaster reflected off metal in the hands of their stalkers Swords or knives These men meant murder You didnt rob women like Shallan and Jasnah women with powerful connections then leave them alive as witnesses Men like these were not the gentlemen bandits of romantic stories They lived each day knowing that if they were caught they would be hanged Paralyzed by fear Shallan couldnt even scream Stormfather Stormfather Stormfather And now Jasnah said voice hard and grim the lesson She whipped off her glove The sudden light was nearly blinding Shallan raised a hand against it stumbling back against the alley wall There were four men around them Not the men from the tavern entrance but others Men she hadnt noticed watching them She could see the knives now and she could also see the murder in their eyes Her scream finally broke free The men grunted at the glare but shoved their way forward A thickchested man with a dark beard came up to Jasnah weapon raised She calmly reached her hand outfingers splayedand pressed it against his chest as he swung a knife Shallans breath caught in her throat Jasnahs hand sank into the mans skin and he froze A second later he burned No he became fire Transformed into flames in an eyeblink Rising around Jasnahs hand they formed the outline of a man with head thrown back and mouth open For just a moment the blaze of the mans death outshone Jasnahs gemstones Shallans scream trailed off The figure of flames was strangely beautiful It was gone in a moment the fire dissipating into the night air leaving an orange afterimage in Shallans eyes The other three men began to curse scrambling away tripping over one another in their panic One fell Jasnah turned casually brushing his shoulder with her fingers as he struggled to his knees He became crystal a figure of pure flawless quartzhis clothing transformed along with him The diamond in Jasnahs Soulcaster faded but there was still plenty of Stormlight left to send rainbow sparkles through the transformed corpse The other two men fled in opposite directions Jasnah took a deep breath closing her eyes lifting her hand above her head Shallan held her safehand to her breast stunned confused Terrified Stormlight shot from Jasnahs hand like twin bolts of lightning symmetrical One struck each of the footpads and they popped puffing into smoke Their empty clothing dropped to the ground With a sharp snap the smokestone crystal on Jasnahs Soulcaster cracked its light vanishing leaving her with just the diamond and the ruby The remains of the two footpads rose into the air small billows of greasy vapor Jasnah opened her eyes looking eerily calm She tugged her glove back onusing her safehand to hold it against her stomach and sliding her freehand fingers in Then she calmly walked back the way they had come She left the crystal corpse kneeling with hand upraised Frozen forever Shallan pried herself off the wall and hastened after Jasnah sickened and amazed Ardents were forbidden to use their Soulcasters on people They rarely even used them in front of others And how had Jasnah struck down two men at a distance From everything Shallan had readwhat little there was to findSoulcasting required physical contact Too overwhelmed to demand answers she stood silentfreehand held to the side of her head trying to control her trembling and her gasping breathsas Jasnah called for a palanquin One came eventually and the two women climbed in The bearers carried them toward the Ralinsa their steps jostling Shallan and Jasnah who sat across from one another in the palanquin Jasnah idly popped the broken smokestone from her Soulcaster then tucked it into a pocket It could be sold to a gemsmith who could cut smaller gemstones from the salvaged pieces That was horrible Shallan finally said hand still held to her breast It was one of the most awful things Ive ever experienced You killed four men Four men who were planning to beat rob kill and possibly rape us You tempted them into coming for us Did I force them to commit any crimes You showed off your gemstones Can a woman not walk with her possessions down the street of a city At night Shallan asked Through a rough area Displaying wealth You all but asked for what happened Does that make it right Jasnah said leaning forward Do you condone what the men were planning to do Of course not But that doesnt make what you did right either And yet those men are off the street The people of this city are that much safer The issue that Taravangian has been so worried about has been solved and no more theatergoers will fall to those thugs How many lives did I just save I know how many you just took Shallan said And through the power of something that should be holy Philosophy in action An important lesson for you You did all this just to prove a point Shallan said softly You did this to prove to me that you could Damnation Jasnah how could you do something like that Jasnah didnt reply Shallan stared at the woman searching for emotion in those expressionless eyes Stormfather Did I ever really know this woman Who is she really Jasnah leaned back watching the city pass I did not do this just to prove a point child I have been feeling for some time that I took advantage of His Majestys hospitality He doesnt realize how much trouble he could face for allying himself with me Besides men like those There was something in her voice an edge Shallan had never heard before What was done to you Shallan wondered with horror And who did it Regardless Jasnah continued tonights actions came about because I chose this path not because of anything I felt you needed to see However the opportunity also presented a chance for instruction for questions Am I a monster or am I a hero Did I just slaughter four men or did I stop four murderers from walking the streets Does one deserve to have evil done to her by consequence of putting herself where evil can reach her Did I have a right to defend myself Or was I just looking for an excuse to end lives I dont know Shallan whispered You will spend the next week researching it and thinking on it If you wish to be a scholara true scholar who changes the worldthen you will need to face questions like this There will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach Shallan Davar Ill have you ready to make those decisions Jasnah fell silent looking out the side as the palanquin bearers marched them up to the Conclave Too troubled to say more Shallan suffered the rest of the trip in silence She followed Jasnah through the hushed hallways to their rooms passing scholars on their way to the Palanaeum for some midnight study Inside their rooms Shallan helped Jasnah undress though she hated touching the woman She shouldnt have felt that way The men Jasnah had killed were terrible creatures and she had little doubt that they would have killed her But it wasnt the act itself so much as the cold callousness of it that bothered her Still feeling numb Shallan fetched Jasnah a sleeping robe as the woman removed her jewelry and set it on the dressing table You could have let the other three get away Shallan said walking back toward Jasnah who had sat down to brush her hair You only needed to kill one of them No I didnt Jasnah said Why They would have been too frightened to do something like that again You dont know that I sincerely wanted those men gone A careless barmaid walking home the wrong way can not protect herself but I can And I will You have no authority to do so not in someone elses city True Jasnah said Another point to consider I suppose She raised the brush to her hair pointedly turning away from Shallan She closed her eyes as if to shut Shallan out The Soulcaster sat on the dressing table beside Jasnahs earrings Shallan gritted her teeth holding the soft silken robe Jasnah sat in her white underdress brushing her hair There will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach Shallan Davar Ive faced them already Im facing one now How dare Jasnah do this How dare she make Shallan a part of it How dare she use something beautiful and holy as a device for destruction Jasnah didnt deserve to own the Soulcaster With a swift move of her hand Shallan tucked the folded robe under her safearm then shoved her hand into her safepouch and popped out the intact smokestone from her fathers Soulcaster She stepped up to the dressing table andusing the motion of placing the robe onto the table as a covermade the exchange She slid the working Soulcaster into her safehand within its sleeve stepping back as Jasnah opened her eyes and glanced at the robe which now sat innocently beside the nonfunctional Soulcaster Shallans breath caught in her throat Jasnah closed her eyes again handing the brush toward Shallan Fifty strokes tonight Shallan It has been a fatiguing day Shallan moved by rote brushing her mistresss hair while clutching the stolen Soulcaster in her hidden safehand panicked that Jasnah would notice the swap at any moment She didnt Not when she put on her robe Not when she tucked the broken Soulcaster away in her jewelry case and locked it with a key she wore around her neck as she slept Shallan walked from the room stunned in turmoil Exhausted sickened confused But undiscovered FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO Kaladin look at this rock Tien said It changes colors when you look at it from different sides Kal looked away from the window glancing at his brother Now thirteen years of age Tien had turned from an eager boy into an eager adolescent Though hed grown he was still small for his age and his mop of black and brown hair still refused all attempts at order He was squatting beside the lacquered cobwood dinner table eyes level with the glossy surface looking at a small lumpish rock Kal sat on a stool peeling longroots with a short knife The brown roots were dirty on the outside and sticky when he sliced into them so working on them coated his fingers with a thick layer of crem He finished a root and handed it up to his mother who washed it off and sliced it into the stew pot Mother look at this Tien said Lateafternoon sunlight streamed through the leeside window bathing the table From this side the rock sparkles red but from the other side its green Perhaps its magical Hesina said Chunk after chunk of longroot plunked into the water each splash with a slightly different note I think it must be Tien said Or it has a spren Do spren live in rocks Spren live in everything Hesina replied They cant live in everything Kal said dropping a peel into the pail at his feet He glanced out the window watching the road that led from the town to the citylords mansion They do Hesina said Spren appear when something changeswhen fear appears or when it begins to rain They are the heart of change and therefore the heart of all things This longroot Kal said holding it up skeptically Has a spren And if you slice it up Each bit has a spren Only smaller Kal frowned looking over the long tuber They grew in cracks in the stone where water collected They tasted faintly of minerals but were easy to grow His family needed food that didnt cost much these days So we eat spren Kal said flatly No she said we eat the roots When we have to Tien added with a grimace And the spren Kal pressed They are freed To return to wherever it is that spren live Do I have a spren Tien said looking down at his chest You have a soul dear Youre a person But the pieces of your body may very well have spren living in them Very small ones Tien pinched at his skin as if trying to pry the tiny spren out Dung Kal said suddenly Kal Hesina snapped Thats not talk for mealtime Dung Kal said stubbornly It has spren I suppose it does Dungspren Tien said then snickered His mother continued to chop Why all of these questions suddenly Kal shrugged I justI dont know Because Hed been thinking recently about the way the world worked about what he was to do with his place in it The other boys his age they didnt wonder about their place Most knew what their future held Working in the fields Kal had a choice though Over the last several months hed finally made that choice He would become a soldier He was fifteen now and could volunteer when the next recruiter came through town He planned to do just that No more wavering He would learn to fight That was the end of it Wasnt it I want to understand he said I just want everything to make sense His mother smiled at that standing in her brown work dress hair pulled back in a tail the top hidden beneath her yellow kerchief What he demanded Why are you smiling You just want everything to make sense Yes Well next time the ardents come through the town to burn prayers and Elevate peoples Callings Ill pass the message along She smiled Until then keep peeling roots Kal sighed but did as she told him He checked out the window again and nearly dropped the root in shock The carriage It was coming down the roadway from the mansion He felt a flutter of nervous hesitation Hed planned hed thought but now that the time was upon him he wanted to sit and keep peeling There would be another opportunity surely No He stood trying to keep the anxiety from his voice Im going to go rinse off He held up cremcovered fingers You should have washed the roots off first as I told you his mother noted I know Kal said Did his sigh of regret sound fake Maybe Ill just wash them all off now Hesina said nothing as he gathered up the remaining roots crossed to the door heart thumping and stepped out into the evening light See Tien said from behind from this side its green I dont think its a spren Mother Its the light It makes the rock change The door swung closed Kal set down the tubers and charged through the streets of Hearthstone passing men chopping wood women throwing out dishwater and a group of grandfathers sitting on steps and looking at the sunset He dunked his hands into a rain barrel but didnt stop as he shook the water free He ran around Mabrow Pigherders house up past the commonwaterthe large hole cut into the rock at the center of the town to catch rainand along the breakwall the steep hillside against which the town was built to shield it from storms Here he found a small stand of stumpweight trees Knobby and about as tall as a man they grew leaves only on their leeward sides running down the length of the tree like rungs on a ladder waving in the cool breeze As Kal got close the large bannerlike leaves snapped up close to the trunks making a series of whipping sounds Kals father stood on the other side hands clasped behind his back He was waiting where the road from the manor turned past Hearthstone Lirin turned with a start noticing Kal He wore his finest clothing a blue coat buttoning up the sides like a lighteyess coat But it was over a pair of white trousers that showed wear He studied Kal through his spectacles Im going with you Kal blurted Up to the mansion How did you know Everyone knows Kal said You think they wouldnt talk if Brightlord Roshone invited you to dinner You of all people Lirin looked away I told your mother to keep you busy She tried Kal grimaced Ill probably hear a storm of it when she finds those longroots sitting outside the front door Lirin said nothing The carriage rolled to a stop nearby wheels grinding against the stone This will not be a pleasant idle meal Kal Lirin said Im not a fool Father When Hesina had been told there was no more need for her to work in the townWell there was a reason theyd been reduced to eating longroots If youre going to confront him then you should have someone to support you And that someone is you Im pretty much all you have The coachman cleared his throat He didnt get down and open the door the way he did for Brightlord Roshone Lirin eyed Kal If you send me back Ill go Kal said No Come along if you must Lirin walked up to the carriage and pulled open the door It wasnt the fancy goldtrimmed vehicle that Roshone used This was the second carriage the older brown one Kal climbed in feeling a surge of excitement at the small victoryand an equal measure of panic They were going to face Roshone Finally The benches inside were amazing the red cloth covering them softer than anything Kal had ever felt He sat down and the seat was surprisingly springy Lirin sat across from Kal pulling the door closed and the coachman snapped his whip at the horses The vehicle turned around and rattled back up the road As soft as the seat was the ride was terribly bumpy and it rattled Kals teeth against one another It was worse than riding in a wagon though that was probably because they were going faster Why didnt you want us to know about this Kal asked I wasnt certain Id go What else would you do Move away Lirin said Take you to Kharbranth and escape this town this kingdom and Roshones petty grudges Kal blinked in shock Hed never thought of that Suddenly everything seemed to expand His future changed wrapping upon itself folding into a new form entirely Father Mother Tienwith him Really Lirin nodded absently Even if we didnt go to Kharbranth Im sure many Alethi towns would welcome us Most have never had a surgeon to care for them They do the best they can with local men who learned most of what they know from superstition or working on the occasional wounded chull We could even move to Kholinar Im skilled enough to get work as a physicians assistant there Why dont we go then Why havent we gone Lirin watched out the window I dont know We should leave It makes sense We have the money We arent wanted here The citylord hates us the people mistrust us the Stormfather himself seems inclined to knock us down There was something in Lirins voice Regret I tried very hard to leave once Lirin said more softly But theres a tie between a mans home and his heart Ive cared for these people Kal Delivered their children set their bones healed their scrapes Youve seen the worst of them these last few years but there was a time before that a good time He turned to Kal clasping his hands in front of him the carriage rattling Theyre mine son And Im theirs Theyre my responsibility now that Wistiow has gone I cant leave them to Roshone Even if they like what hes doing Particularly because of that Lirin raised a hand to his head Stormfather It sounds more foolish now that I say it No I understand I think Kal shrugged I guess well they still come to us when theyre hurt They complain about how unnatural it is to cut into a person but they still come I used to wonder why And did you come to a conclusion Kind of I decided that in the end theyd rather be alive to curse at you a few more days Its what they do Just like healing them is what you do And they used to give you money A man can say all kinds of things but where he sets his spheres thats where his heart is Kal frowned I guess they did appreciate you Lirin smiled Wise words I keep forgetting that youre nearly a man Kal When did you go and grow up on me That night when we were nearly robbed Kal thought immediately That night when you shone light on the men outside and showed that bravery had nothing to do with a spear held in battle Youre wrong about one thing though Lirin said You told me that they did appreciate me But they still do Oh they grumbletheyve always done that But they also leave food for us Kal started They do How do you think weve been eating these last four months But Theyre frightened of Roshone so theyre quiet about it They left it for your mother when she went to clean or put it in the rain barrel when its empty They tried to rob us And those very men were among the ones who gave us food as well Kal pondered that as the carriage arrived at the manor house It had been a long time since hed visited the large twostory building It was constructed with a standard roof that sloped toward the stormward side but was much larger The walls were of thick white stones and it had majestic square pillars on the leeward side Would he see Laral here He was embarrassed by how infrequently he thought about her these days The mansions front grounds had a low stone wall covered with all kinds of exotic plants Rockbuds lined the top their vines draping down the outside Clusters of a bulbous variety of shalebark grew along the inside bursting with a variety of bright colors Oranges reds yellows and blues Some outcroppings looked like heaps of clothing with folds spread like fans Others grew out like horns Most had tendrils like threads that waved in the wind Brightlord Roshone paid much more attention to his grounds than Wistiow had They walked up past the whitewashed pillars and entered between the thick wooden stormdoors The vestibule inside had a low ceiling and was decorated with ceramics zircon spheres gave them a pale blue cast A tall servant in a long black coat and a bright purple cravat greeted them He was Natir the steward now that Miliv had died Hed been brought in from Dalilak a large coastal city to the north Natir led them to a dining room where Roshone sat at a long darkwood table Hed gained weight though not enough to be called fat He still had that greyflecked beard and his hair was greased back down to his collar He wore white trousers and a tight red vest over a white shirt Hed already begun his meal and the spicy scents made Kals stomach rumble How long had it been since hed had pork There were five different dipping sauces on the table and Roshones wine was a deep crystalline orange He ate alone no sign of Laral or his son The servant gestured toward a side table set up in a room next to the dining hall Kals father took one look at it then walked to Roshones table and sat down Roshone paused skewer halfway to his lips spicy brown sauce dripping to the table before him Im of the second nahn Lirin said and I have a personal invitation to dine with you Surely you follow the precepts of rank closely enough to give me a place at your table Roshone clenched his teeth but did not object Taking a deep breath Kal sat down beside his father Before he left to join the war on the Shattered Plains he had to know Was his father a coward or a man of courage By the light of spheres at home Lirin had always seemed weak He worked in his surgery room ignoring what the townspeople said about him He told his son he couldnt practice with the spear and forbade him to think of going to war Werent those the actions of a coward But five months ago Kal had seen courage in him that hed never expected And in the calm blue light of Roshones palace Lirin met the eyes of a man far above him in rank wealth and power And did not flinch How did he do it Kals heart thumped uncontrollably He had to put his hands in his lap to keep them from betraying his nervousness Roshone waved to a serving man and within a short time new places had been set The periphery of the room was dark Roshones table was an illuminated island amid a vast black expanse There were bowls of water for dipping ones fingers and stiff white cloth napkins beside them A lighteyes meal Kal had rarely eaten such fine food he tried not to make a fool of himself as he hesitantly took a skewer and imitated Roshone using his knife to slide down the bottommost chunk of meat then raising it and biting The meat was savory and tender though the spices were much hotter than he was accustomed to Lirin did not eat He rested his elbows on the table watching the Brightlord dine I wished to offer you the chance to eat in peace Roshone said eventually before we talked of serious matters But you dont seem inclined to partake of my generosity No Very well Roshone said taking a piece of flatbread from the basket and wrapping it around his skewer pulling off several vegetable chunks at once and eating them with the bread Then tell me How long do you think you can defy me Your family is destitute We do just fine Kal cut in Lirin glanced at him but did not chastise him for speaking My son is correct We can live And if that doesnt work we can leave I will not bend to your will Roshone If you left Roshone said holding up a finger I would contact your new citylord and tell him of the spheres stolen from me I would win an inquest over that Besides as a surgeon I am immune to most demands you could make It was true men and their apprentices who served an essential function in towns were afforded special protection even from lighteyes The Vorin legal code of citizenship was complex enough that Kaladin still had difficulty understanding it Yes you would win an inquest Roshone said You were so meticulous preparing the exact right documents You were the only one with Wistiow when he stamped them Odd that none of his clerks were there Those clerks read him the documents And then left the room Because they were ordered to leave by Brightlord Wistiow They have admitted this I believe Roshone shrugged I dont need to prove that you stole the spheres surgeon I simply have to continue doing as I have been I know that your family eats scraps How long will you continue to make them suffer for your pride They wont be intimidated And neither will I Im not asking if youre intimidated Im asking if youre starving Not by any means Lirin said voice growing dry If we lack for something to eat we can feast upon the attention you lavish upon us Brightlord We feel your eyes watching hear your whispers to the townspeople Judging from the degree of your concern with us it would seem that you are the one who is intimidated Roshone fell still skewer held limply in his hand brilliant green eyes narrowed lips pursed tight In the dark those eyes almost seemed to glow Kal had to stop himself from cringing under the weight of that disapproving gaze There was an air of command about lighteyes like Roshone Hes not a real lighteyes Hes a reject Ill see real ones eventually Men of honor Lirin held the gaze evenly Every month we resist is a blow to your authority You cant have me arrested since I would win an inquest Youve tried to turn the other people against me but they knowdeep downthat they need me Roshone leaned forward I do not like your little town Lirin frowned at the odd response I do not like being treated like an exile Roshone continued I do not like living so far from anythingeverythingimportant And most of all I do not like darkeyes who think themselves above their stations I have trouble feeling sympathy for you Roshone sneered He looked down at his meal as if it had lost any flavor Very well Let us make anaccommodation I will take ninetenths of the spheres You can have the rest Kal stood up indignantly My father will never Kal Lirin cut in I can speak for myself Surely you wont make a deal though Lirin didnt reply immediately Finally he said Go to the kitchens Kal Ask them if they have some food more to your tastes Father no Go son Lirins voice was firm Was it true After all of this would his father simply capitulate Kal felt his face grow red and he fled the dining room He knew the way to the kitchens During his childhood hed often dined there with Laral He left not because he was told to but because he didnt want his father or Roshone to see his emotions chagrin at having stood to denounce Roshone when his father planned to make a deal humiliation that his father would consider a deal frustration at being banished Kal was mortified to find himself crying He passed a couple of Roshones house soldiers standing at the doorway lit only by a very lowtrimmed oil lamp on the wall Their rough features were highlighted in amber hues Kal hastened past them turning a corner before pausing beside a plant stand struggling with his emotions The stand displayed an indoor vinebud one bred to remain open a few conelike flowers climbed up from its vestigial shell The lamp on the wall above it burned with a tiny strangled light These were the back rooms of the mansion near the servant quarters and spheres were not used for light here Kal leaned back breathing in and out He felt like one of the ten foolsspecifically Cabine who acted like a child though he was adult But what was he to think of Lirins actions He wiped his eyes then pushed his way through the swinging doors into the kitchens Roshone still employed Wistiows chef Barm was a tall slender man with dark hair that he wore braided He walked down the line of his kitchen counter giving instructions to his various subchefs as a couple of parshmen walked in and out through the mansions back doors carrying in crates of food Barm carried a long metal spoon which banged on a pot or pan hanging from the ceiling each time he gave an order He barely spared Kal a browneyed glance then told one of his servants to go fetch some flatbread and fruited tallew rice A childs meal Kal felt even more embarrassed that Barm had known instantly why he had been sent to the kitchens Kal walked to the dining nook to wait for the food It was a whitewashed alcove with a slatetopped table He sat down elbows on the stone head on his hands Why did it make him so angry to think that his father might bargain away most of the spheres in exchange for safety True if that happened there wouldnt be enough to send Kal to Kharbranth But hed already decided to become a soldier So it didnt matter Did it I am going to join the army Kal thought Ill run away Ill Suddenly that dreamthat planseemed incredibly childish It belonged to a boy who ought to eat fruited meals and deserved to be sent away when the men talked of important topics For the first time the thought of not training with the surgeons filled him with regret The door into the kitchens banged open Roshones son Rillir sauntered in chatting with the person behind him dont know why Father insists on keeping everything so dreary around here all the time Oil lamps in the hallways Could he be any more provincial It would do him some real good if I could get him out on a hunt or two We might as well get some use out of being in this remote place Rillir noticed Kal sitting there but passed over him as one might register the presence of a stool or a shelf for wine noting it but otherwise ignoring it Kals own eyes were on the person who followed Rillir Laral Wistiows daughter So much had changed It had been so long and seeing her brought up old emotions Shame excitement Did she know that his parents had been hoping to marry him to her Merely seeing her again almost flustered him completely But no His father could look Roshone in the eyes He could do the same with her Kal stood up and nodded to her She glanced at him and blushed faintly walking in with an old nurse in towa chaperone What had happened to the Laral hed known the girl with the loose yellow and black hair who liked climbing on rocks and running through fields Now she was wrapped up in sleek yellow silk a stylish lighteyed womans dress her neatly coiffed hair dyed black to hide the blond Her left hand was hidden modestly in her sleeve Laral looked like a lighteyes Wistiows wealthwhat was left of ithad gone to her And when Roshone had been given authority over Hearthstone and granted the mansion and surrounding lands Highprince Sadeas had given Laral a dowry in compensation You Rillir said nodding to Kal and speaking in a smooth city accent Be a good lad and fetch us some supper Well take it here in the nook Im not a kitchen servant So Kal flushed If youre expecting some kind of tip or reward for just fetching me a meal Im notI mean Kal looked to Laral Tell him Laral She looked away Well go on boy she said Do as youre told Were hungry Kal gaped at her then felt his face redden even more ImIm not going to fetch you anything he managed to say I wouldnt do it no matter how many spheres you offer me Im not an errand boy Im a surgeon Oh youre that ones son I am Kal said surprised at how proudly he felt those words Im not going to be bullied by you Rillir Roshone Just like my father isnt bullied by yours Except they are making a deal right now Father didnt mention how amusing you were Rillir said leaning back against the wall He seemed a decade older than Kal not a mere two years So you find it shameful to fetch a man his meal Being a surgeon makes you that much better than the kitchen staff Well no Its just not my Calling Then what is your Calling Making sick people well And if I dont eat wont I be sick So couldnt you call it your duty to see me fed Kal frowned Itswell its not the same thing at all I see it as being very similar Look why dont you just go get yourself some food Its not my Calling Then what is your Calling Kal returned throwing the mans own words back at him Im cityheir Rillir said My duty is to leadto see that jobs get done and that people are occupied in productive work And as such I give important tasks to idling darkeyes to make them useful Kal hesitated growing angry You see how his little mind works Rillir said to Laral Like a dying fire burning what little fuel it has pumping out smoke Ah and look his face grows red from the heat of it Rillir please Laral said laying her hand on his arm Rillir glanced at her then rolled his eyes Youre as provincial as my father sometimes dear He stood up straight andwith a look of resignationled her past the nook and into the kitchen proper Kal sat back down hard nearly bruising his legs on the bench with the force of it A serving boy brought him his food and set it on the table but that only reminded Kal of his childishness So he didnt eat it he just stared at it until eventually his father walked into the kitchen Rillir and Laral were gone by then Lirin walked to the alcove and surveyed Kal You didnt eat Kal shook his head You should have It was free Come on They walked in silence from the mansion into the dark night The carriage awaited them and soon Kal again sat facing his father The driver climbed into place making the vehicle quiver and a snap of his whip set the horses in motion I want to be a surgeon Kal said suddenly His fathers facehidden in shadowwas unreadable But when he spoke he sounded confused I know that son No I want to be a surgeon I dont want to run away to join the war Silence in the darkness You were considering that Lirin asked Yes Kal admitted It was childish But Ive decided for myself that I want to learn surgery instead Why What made you change I need to know how they think Kal said nodding back toward the mansion Theyre trained to speak their sentences in knots and I have to be able to face them and talk back at them Not fold like He hesitated Like I did Lirin asked with a sigh Kal bit his lip but had to ask How many spheres did you agree to give him Will I still have enough to go to Kharbranth I didnt give him a thing But Roshone and I talked for a time arguing over amounts I pretended to grow hotheaded and left Pretended Kal asked confused His father leaned forward whispering to make certain the driver couldnt hear With the bouncing and the noise of the wheels on the stone there was little danger of that He has to think that Im willing to bend Todays meeting was about giving the appearance of desperation A strong front at first followed by frustration letting him think that hed gotten to me Finally a retreat Hell invite me again in a few months after letting me sweat But you wont bend then either Kal whispered No Giving him any of the spheres would make him greedy for the rest These lands dont produce as they used to and Roshone is nearly broke from losing political battles I still dont know which highlord was behind sending him here to torment us though I wish I had him for a few moments in a dark room The ferocity with which Lirin said that shocked Kal It was the closest hed ever heard his father come to threatening real violence But why go through this in the first place Kal whispered You said that we can keep resisting him Mother thinks so too We wont eat well but we wont starve His father didnt reply though he looked troubled You need to make him think that were capitulating Kal said Or that were close to doing so So that hell stop looking for ways to undermine us So hell focus his attention on making a deal and not Kal froze He saw something unfamiliar in his fathers eyes Something like guilt Suddenly it made sense Cold terrible sense Stormfather Kal whispered You did steal the spheres didnt you His father remained silent riding in the old carriage shadowed and black Thats why youve been so tense since Wistiow died Kal whispered The drinking the worryingYoure a thief Were a family of thieves The carriage turned and the violet light of Salas illuminated Lirins face He didnt look half so ominous from that anglein fact he looked fragile He clasped his hands before him eyes reflecting moonlight Wistiow was not lucid during the final days Kal he whispered I knew that with his death we would lose the promise of a union Laral had not reached her day of majority and the new citylord wouldnt let a darkeyes take her inheritance through marriage So you robbed him Kal felt himself shrinking I made certain that promises were kept I had to do something I couldnt trust to the generosity of the new citylord Wisely as you can see All of this time Kal had assumed that Roshone was persecuting them out of malice and spite But it turned out he was justified I cant believe it Does it change so much Lirin whispered His face looked haunted in the dim light What is different now Everything And yet nothing Roshone still wants those spheres and we still deserve them Wistiow if hed been fully lucid would have given us those spheres Im certain But he didnt No Things were the same yet different One step and the world flipped upside down The villain became the hero the hero the villain I Kal said I cant decide if what you did was incredibly brave or incredibly wrong Lirin sighed I know how you feel He sat back Please dont tell Tien what weve done What weve done Hesina had helped him When you are older youll understand Maybe Kal said shaking his head But one thing hasnt changed I want to go to Kharbranth Even on stolen spheres Ill find a way to pay them back Not to Roshone To Laral Shell be a Roshone before too long Lirin said We should expect an engagement between her and Rillir before the year is out Roshone will not let her slip away not now that hes lost political favor in Kholinar She represents one of the few chances his son has for an alliance with a good house Kal felt his stomach turn at the mention of Laral I have to learn Perhaps I can Can what he thought Come back and convince her to leave Rillir for me Ridiculous He looked up suddenly at his father who had bowed his head looking sorrowful He was a hero A villain too But a hero to his family I wont tell Tien Kal whispered And Im going to use the spheres to travel to Kholinar and study His father looked up I want to learn to face lighteyes like you do Kal said Any of them can make a fool of me I want to learn to talk like them think like them I want you to learn so that you can help people son Not so you can get back at the lighteyes I think I can do both If I can learn to be clever enough Lirin snorted Youre plenty clever son Youve got enough of your mother in you to talk circles around a lighteyes The university will show you how Kal I want to start going by my full name he replied surprising himself Kaladin It was a mans name Hed always disliked how it sounded like the name of a lighteyes Now it seemed to fit He wasnt a darkeyed farmer but he wasnt a lighteyed lord either Something in between Kal had been a child who wanted to join the army because it was what other boys dreamed of Kaladin would be a man who learned surgery and all the ways of the lighteyes And someday he would return to this town and prove to Roshone Rillir and Laral herself that they had been wrong to dismiss him Very well Lirin said Kaladin Born from the darkness they bear its taint still marked upon their bodies much as the fire marks their souls I consider GashashsonNavammis a trustworthy source though Im not certain about this translation Find the original quote in the fourteenth book of Seld and retranslate it myself perhaps Kaladin floated Persistent fever accompanied by cold sweats and hallucinations Likely cause is infected wounds clean with antiseptic to ward away rotspren Keep the subject hydrated He was back in Hearthstone with his family Only he was a grown man The soldier he had become And he didnt fit with them anymore His father kept asking How did this happen You said you wanted to become a surgeon A surgeon Broken ribs Caused by trauma to the side inflicted by a beating Wrap the chest and prevent the subject from taking part in strenuous activity Occasionally hed open his eyes and see a dark room It was cold the walls made of stone with a high roof Other people lay in lines covered in blankets Corpses They were corpses This was a ware house where they were lined up for sale Who bought corpses Highprince Sadeas He bought corpses They still walked after he bought them but they were corpses The stupid ones refused to accept it pretending they were alive Lacerations on face arms and chest Outer layer of skin stripped away in several patches Caused by prolonged exposure to highstorm winds Bandage wounded areas apply a denocax salve to encourage new skin growth Time was passing A lot of it He should be dead Why wasnt he dead He wanted to lie back and let it happen But no No He had failed Tien He had failed Goshel He had failed his parents He had failed Dallet Dear Dallet He would not fail Bridge Four He would not Hypothermia caused by extreme cold Warm subject and force him to remain seated Do not let him sleep If he survives a few hours there will likely be no lasting aftereffects If he survives a few hours Bridgemen werent supposed to survive Why would Lamaril say that What army would employ men who were supposed to die His perspective had been too narrow too shortsighted He needed to understand the armys objectives He watched the battles progress horrified What had he done He needed to go back and change it But no He was wounded wasnt he He was bleeding on the ground He was one of the fallen spearmen He was a bridgeman from Bridge Two betrayed by those fools in Bridge Four who diverted all of the archers How dare they How dare they How dare they survive by killing me Strained tendons ripped muscles bruised and cracked bones and pervasive soreness caused by extreme conditions Enforce bed rest by any means necessary Check for large and persistent bruises or pallor caused by internal hemorrhaging That can be lifethreatening Be prepared for surgery He saw the deathspren They were fistsize and black with many legs and deep red eyes that glowed leaving trails of burning light They clustered around him skittering this way and that Their voices were whispers scratchy sounds like paper being torn They terrified him but he couldnt escape them He could barely move Only the dying could see deathspren You saw them then died Only the very very lucky few survived after that Deathspren knew when the end was close Blistered fingers and toes caused by frostnip Make sure to apply antiseptic to any blisters that break Encourage the bodys natural healing Permanent damage is unlikely Standing before the deathspren was a tiny figure of light Not translucent as she had always appeared before but of pure white light That soft feminine face had a nobler more angular cast to it now like a warrior from a forgotten time Not childlike at all She stood guard on his chest holding a sword made of light That glow was so pure so sweet It seemed to be the glow of life itself Whenever one of the deathspren got too close she would charge at it wielding her radiant blade The light warded them off But there were a lot of deathspren More and more each time he was lucid enough to look Severe delusions caused by trauma to the head Maintain observation of subject Do not allow alcohol intake Enforce rest Administer fathom bark to reduce cranial swelling Firemoss can be used in extreme cases but beware letting the subject form an addiction If medication fails trepanning the skull may be needed to relieve pressure Usually fatal Teft entered the barrack at midday Ducking into the shadowy interior was like entering a cave He glanced to the left where the other wounded usually slept They were all outside at the moment getting some sun All five were doing well even Leyten Teft passed the lines of rolledup blankets at the sides of the room walking to the back of the chamber where Kaladin lay Poor man Teft thought Whats worse being sick near to death or having to stay all the way back here away from the light It was necessary Bridge Four walked a precarious line They had been allowed to cut Kaladin down and so far nobody had tried to stop them from caring for him Practically the entire army had heard Sadeas give Kaladin to the Stormfather for judgment Gaz had come to see Kaladin then had snorted to himself in amusement Hed likely told his superiors that Kaladin would die Men didnt live long with wounds like those Yet Kaladin hung on Soldiers were going out of their way to try to get a peek at him His survival was incredible People were talking in camp Given to the Stormfather for judgment then spared A miracle Sadeas wouldnt like that How long would it be before one of the lighteyes decided to relieve their brightlord of the problem Sadeas couldnt take any overt actionnot without losing a great deal of credibilitybut a quiet poisoning or suffocation would abbreviate the embarrassment So Bridge Four kept Kaladin as far from outside eyes as possible And they always left someone with him Always Storming man Teft thought kneeling beside the feverish patient in his tousled blankets eyes closed face sweaty body bound with a frightful number of bandages Most were stained red They didnt have the money to change them often Skar kept watch currently The short strongfaced man sat at Kaladins feet How is he Teft asked Skar spoke softly He seems to be getting worse Teft I heard him mumble about dark shapes thrashing and telling them to keep back He opened his eyes He didnt seem to see me but he saw something I swear it Deathspren Teft thought feeling a chill Kelek preserve us Ill take a turn Teft said sitting You go get something to eat Skar stood looking pale It would crush the others spirit for Kaladin to survive the highstorm then die of his wounds Skar shuffled from the room shoulders slumped Teft watched Kaladin for a long while trying to gather his thoughts his emotions Why now he whispered Why here After so many have watched and waited you come here But of course Teft was getting ahead of himself He didnt know for certain He only had assumptions and hopes No not hopesfears He had rejected the Envisagers And yet here he was He fished in his pocket and pulled out three small diamond spheres It had been a long long while since hed saved anything of his wages but hed held on to these thinking worrying They glowed with Stormlight in his hand Did he really want to know Gritting his teeth Teft moved closer to Kaladins side looking down at the unconscious mans face You bastard he whispered You storming bastard You took a bunch of hanged men and lifted them up just enough to breathe Now youre going to leave them I wont have it you hear I wont He pressed the spheres into Kaladins hand wrapping the limp fingers around them then laying the hand on Kaladins abdomen Then Teft sat back on his heels What would happen All the Envisagers had were stories and legends Fools tales Teft had called them Idle dreams He waited Of course nothing happened Youre as big a fool as any Teft he told himself He reached for Kaladins hand Those spheres would buy a few drinks Kaladin gasped suddenly drawing in a short quick powerful breath The glow in his hand faded Teft froze eyes widening Wisps of Light began to rise from Kaladins body It was faint but there was no mistaking that glowing white Stormlight streaming off his frame It was as if Kaladin had been bathed in sudden heat and his very skin steamed Kaladins eyes snapped open and they leaked light too faintly colored amber He gasped again loudly and the trailing wisps of light began to twist around the exposed cuts on his chest A few of them pulled together and knit themselves up Then it was gone the Light of those tiny chips expended Kaladins eyes closed and he relaxed His wounds were still bad his fever still raging but some color had returned to his skin The puffy redness around several cuts had diminished My God Teft said realizing he was trembling Almighty cast from heaven to dwell in our heartsIt is true He bowed his head to the rock floor squeezing his eyes shut tears leaking from their corners Why now he thought again Why here And in the name of all heaven why me He knelt for a hundred heartbeats counting thinking worrying Eventually he pulled himself to his feet and retrieved the spheresnow dunfrom Kaladins hand Hed need to trade them for spheres with Light in them Then he could return and let Kaladin drain those as well Hed have to be careful A few spheres each day but not too many If the boy healed too quickly it would draw too much attention And I need to tell the Envisagers he thought I need to The Envisagers were gone Dead because of what he had done If there were others he had no idea how to locate them Who would he tell Who would believe him Kaladin himself probably didnt understand what he was doing Best to keep it quiet at least until he could figure out what to do about it Within a heartbeat Alezarv was there crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot Another folktale this one recorded in Among the Darkeyed by Calinam Page 102 Stories of instantaneous travel and the Oathgates pervade these tales Shallans hand flew across the drawing board moving as if of its own accord charcoal scratching sketching smudging Thick lines first like trails of blood left by a thumb drawn across rough granite Tiny lines like scratches made by a pin She sat in her closetlike stone chamber in the Conclave No windows no ornamentation on the granite walls Just the bed her trunk the nightstand and the small desk that doubled as a drawing table A single ruby broam cast a bloody light on her sketch Usually to produce a vibrant drawing she had to consciously memorize a scene A blink freezing the world imprinting it into her mind She hadnt done that during Jasnahs annihilation of the thieves Shed been too frozen by horror or morbid fascination Despite that she could see each of those scenes in her mind just as vividly as if shed deliberately memorized them And these memories didnt vanish when she drew them She couldnt rid her mind of them Those deaths were burned into her She sat back from her drawing board hand shaking the picture before her an exact charcoal representation of the suffocating nightscape squeezed between alley walls a tortured figure of flame rising toward the sky At that moment its face still held its shape shadow eyes wide and burning lips agape Jasnahs hand was toward the figure as if warding or worshipping Shallan drew her charcoalstained fingers to her chest staring at her creation It was one of dozens of drawings shed done during the last few days The man turned into fire the other frozen into crystal the two transmuted to smoke She could only draw one of those two fully shed been facing down the alleyway to the east Her drawings of the fourth mans death were of smoke rising clothing already on the ground She felt guilty for being unable to record his death And she felt stupid for that guilt Logic did not condemn Jasnah Yes the princess had gone willingly into danger but that didnt remove responsibility from those who had chosen to hurt her The mens actions were reprehensible Shallan had spent the days poring through books on philosophy and most ethical frameworks exonerated the princess But Shallan had been there Shed watched those men die Shed seen the terror in their eyes and she felt terrible Hadnt there been another way Kill or be killed That was the Philosophy of Starkness It exonerated Jasnah Actions are not evil Intent is evil and Jasnahs intent had been to stop men from harming others That was the Philosophy of Purpose It lauded Jasnah Morality is separate from the ideals of men It exists whole somewhere to be approachedbut never truly understoodby the mortal The Philosophy of Ideals It claimed that removing evil was ultimately moral and so in destroying evil men Jasnah was justified Objective must be weighed against methods If the goal is worthy then the steps taken are worthwhile even if some of themon their ownare reprehensible The Philosophy of Aspiration It more than any called Jasnahs actions ethical Shallan pulled the sheet from her drawing board and tossed it down beside the others scattered across her bed Her fingers moved again clutching the charcoal pencil beginning a new picture on the blank sheet strapped in place on the table unable to escape Her theft nagged at her as much as the killings did Ironically Jasnahs demand that Shallan study moralistic philosophy forced her to contemplate her own terrible actions Shed come to Kharbranth to steal the fabrial then use it to save her brothers and their house from massive debt and destruction Yet in the end this wasnt why Shallan had stolen the Soulcaster Shed taken it because she was angry with Jasnah If the intentions were more important than the action then she had to condemn herself Perhaps the Philosophy of Aspirationwhich stated that objectives were more important than the steps taken to achieve themwould agree with what shed done but that was the philosophy she found most reprehensible Shallan sat here sketching condemning Jasnah But Shallan was the one who had betrayed a woman who had trusted her and taken her in Now she was planning to commit heresy with the Soulcaster by using it although she was not an ardent The Soulcaster itself lay in the hidden part of Shallans trunk Three days and Jasnah had said nothing about the disappearance She wore the fake each day She said nothing acted no differently Maybe she hadnt tried Soulcasting Almighty send that she didnt go out and put herself into danger again expecting to be able to use the fabrial to kill men who attacked her Of course there was one other aspect of that night that Shallan had to think of She carried a concealed weapon that she hadnt used She felt foolish for not even thinking of getting it out that night But she wasnt accustomed to Shallan froze realizing for the first time what shed been drawing Not another scene from the alleyway but a lavish room with a thick ornamented rug and swords on the walls A long dining table set with a halfeaten meal And a dead man in fine clothing lying facefirst on the floor blood pooling around him She jumped back tossing aside the charcoal then crumpled up the paper Shaking she moved over and sat down on the bed among the pictures Dropping the crumpled drawing she raised her fingers to her forehead feeling the cold sweat there Something was wrong with her with her drawings She had to get out Escape the death the philosophy and the questions She stood and hurriedly strode into the main room of Jasnahs quarters The princess herself was away researching as always She hadnt demanded that Shallan come to the Veil today Was that because she realized that her ward needed time to think alone Or was it because she suspected Shallan of stealing the Soulcaster and no longer trusted her Shallan hurried through the room It was furnished only with the basics provided by King Taravangian Shallan pulled open the door to the hallway and nearly ran into a masterservant who had been reaching up to knock The woman started and Shallan let out a yelp Brightness the woman said bowing immediately Apologies But one of your spanreeds is flashing The woman held up the reed affixed on the side with a small blinking ruby Shallan breathed in and out stilling her heart Thank you she said She like Jasnah left her spanreeds in the care of servants because she was often away from her rooms and was likely to miss any attempt to contact her Still flustered she was tempted to leave the thing and continue on her way However she did need to speak with her brothers Nan Balat particularly and hed been away the last few times shed contacted home She took the spanreed and closed the door She didnt dare return to her rooms with all of those sketches accusing her but there was a desk and a spanreed board in the main room She sat there then twisted the ruby Shallan the reed wrote Are you comfortable It was a code phrase meant to indicate to her that it was indeed Nan Balator at least his betrothedon the other side My back hurts and my wrist itches she wrote back giving the other half of the code phrase Im sorry I missed your other communications Nan Balat sent I had to attend a feast in Fathers name It was with Sur Kamar so it wasnt really something I could miss despite the day of traveling each way Its all right Shallan wrote She took a deep breath I have the item She turned the gem The reed was still for a long moment Finally a hurried hand wrote Praise the Heralds Oh Shallan Youve done it You are on your way back to us then How can you use the spanreed on the ocean Are you in port I havent left Shallan wrote What Why Because it would be too suspicious she wrote Think about it Nan Balat If Jasnah tries the item and finds it broken she might not immediately decide that shes been had That changes if Ive suddenly and suspiciously left for home I have to wait until shes made the discovery then see what she does next If she realizes that her fabrial was replaced with a fake then I can deflect her toward other culprits Shes already suspicious of the ardentia Ifon the other handshe assumes that her fabrial has broken somehow Ill know were free She twisted the gem setting the spanreed in place The question shed been expecting came next And if she immediately assumes that you did it Shallan what if you cant deflect her suspicion What if she orders a search of your chambers and they find the hidden compartment She picked up the pen Then it is still better for me to be here she wrote Balat I have learned much about Jasnah Kholin She is incredibly focused and determined She will not let me escape if she thinks I have robbed her She will hunt me down and will use all of her resources to exact retribution Wed have our own king and highprinces on our property in days demanding that we turn over the fabrial Stormfather Ill bet Jasnah has contacts in Jah Keved that she could reach before I got back Id find myself in custody the moment I landed Our only hope is to deflect her If that doesnt work better for me to be here and suffer her wrath quickly Likely she would take the Soulcaster and banish me from her sight If we make her work and chase after me thoughShe can be very ruthless Balat It would not go well for us The response was long in coming When did you get so good at logic small one he finally sent I see that youve thought this through Better than I have at least But Shallan our time is running out I know she wrote You said you could hold things together for a few more months I ask you to do that Give me two or three weeks at least to see what Jasnah does Besides while I am here I can look into how the thing works I havent found any books that give hints but there are so many here maybe I just havent found the right one yet Very well he wrote A few weeks Be careful small one The men who gave Father his fabrial visited again They asked after you Im worried about them Even more than I worry about our finances They disturb me in a profound way Farewell Farewell she wrote back So far there had been no hint of reaction from the princess She hadnt even mentioned the Soulcaster That made Shallan nervous She wished that Jasnah would just say something The waiting was excruciating Each day while she sat with Jasnah Shallans stomach churned with anxiety until she was nauseated At leastconsidering the killings a few days agoShallan had a very good excuse for looking disturbed Cold calm logic Jasnah herself would be proud A knock came at the door and Shallan quickly gathered up the conversation shed had with Nan Balat and burned it in the hearth A palace maid entered a moment later carrying a basket in the crook of her arm She smiled at Shallan It was time for the daily cleaning Shallan had a strange moment of panic at seeing the woman She wasnt one of the maids Shallan recognized What if Jasnah had sent her or someone else to search Shallans room Had she done so already Shallan nodded to the woman and thento assuage her worriesshe walked to her room and closed the door She rushed to the chest and checked the hidden compartment The fabrial was there She lifted it out inspecting it Would she know if Jasnah somehow reversed the exchange Youre being foolish she told herself Jasnahs subtle but shes not that subtle Still Shallan stuffed the Soulcaster in her safepouch It just barely fit inside the envelopelike cloth container Shed feel safer knowing she had it on her while the maid cleaned her room Besides the safepouch might be a better hiding place for it than her trunk By tradition a womans safepouch was where she kept items of intimate or very precious import To search one would be like stripsearching herconsidering her rank either would be virtually unthinkable unless she were obviously implicated in a crime Jasnah could probably force it But if Jasnah could do that she could order a search of Shallans room and her trunk would be under particular scrutiny The truth was if Jasnah chose to suspect her there would be little Shallan could do to hide the fabrial So the safepouch was as good a place as any She gathered up the pictures shed drawn and put them upsidedown on the desk trying not to look at them She didnt want those to be seen by the maid Finally she left taking her portfolio She felt that she needed to get outside and escape for a while Draw something other than death and murder The conversation with Nan Balat had only served to upset her more Brightness the maid asked Shallan froze but the maid held up a basket This was dropped off for you with the masterservants She hesitantly accepted it looking inside Bread and jam A note tied to one of the jars read Bluebar jam If you like it it means youre mysterious reserved and thoughtful It was signed Kabsal Shallan placed the baskets handle in the crook of her safearms elbow Kabsal Maybe she should go find him She always felt better after a conversation with him But no She was going to leave she couldnt keep stringing him or herself along She was afraid of where the relationship was going Instead she made her way to the main cavern and then to the Conclaves exit She walked out into the sunlight and took a deep breath looking up into the sky as servants and attendants parted around her swarming in and out of the Conclave She held her portfolio close feeling the cool breeze on her cheeks and the contrasting warmth of the sunlight pressing down on her hair and forehead In the end the most disturbing part was that Jasnah had been right Shallans world of simple answers had been a foolish childish place Shed clung to the hope that she could find truth and use it to explainperhaps justifywhat she had done back in Jah Keved But if there was such a thing as truth it was far more complicated and murky than shed assumed Some problems didnt seem to have any good answers Just a lot of wrong ones She could choose the source of her guilt but she couldnt choose to be rid of that guilt entirely Two hoursand about twenty quick sketcheslater Shallan felt far more relaxed She sat in the palace gardens sketchpad in her lap drawing snails The gardens werent as extensive as her fathers but they were far more varied not to mention blessedly secluded Like many modern gardens they were designed with walls of cultivated shalebark This ones made a maze of living stone They were short enough that when standing she could see the way back to the entrance But if she sat down on one of the numerous benches she could feel alone and unseen Shed asked a groundskeeper the name of the most prominent shalebark plant hed called it plated stone A fitting name as it grew in thin round sections that piled atop one another like plates in a cupboard From the sides it looked like weathered rock that exposed hundreds of thin strata Tiny little tendrils grew up out of pores waving in the wind The stonelike casings had a bluish shade but the tendrils were yellowish Her current subject was a snail with a low horizontal shell edged with little ridges When she tapped it would flatten itself into a rift in the shalebark appearing to become part of the plated stone It blended in perfectly When she let it move it nibbled at the shalebarkbut didnt chew it away Its cleaning the shalebark she realized continuing her sketch Eating off the lichen and mold Indeed a cleaner trail extended behind it Patches of a different kind of shalebarkwith fingerlike protrusions growing up into the air from a central knobgrew alongside the plated stone When she looked closely she noted little cremlingsthin and multileggedcrawling along it eating at it Were they too cleaning it Curious she thought beginning a sketch of the miniature cremlings They had carapaces shaded like the shalebarks fingers while the snails shell was a near duplicate of the yellow and blue colorings of the plated stone It was as if they had been designed by the Almighty in pairs the plant giving safety to the animal the animal cleaning the plant A few lifesprentiny glowing green specksfloated around the shalebark mounds Some danced amid the rifts in the bark others in the air like dust motes zigzagging up only to fall again She used a finertipped charcoal pencil to scribble some thoughts about the relationship between the animals and the plants She didnt know of any books that spoke of relationships like this one Scholars seemed to prefer studying big dynamic animals like greatshells or whitespines But this seemed a beautiful wondrous discovery to Shallan Snails and plants can help one another she thought But I betray Jasnah She glanced toward her safehand and the pouch hidden inside She felt more secure having the Soulcaster near She hadnt yet dared try to use it Shed been too nervous about the theft and had worried about using the object near Jasnah Now however she was in a nook deep within the maze with only one curving entrance into her dead end She stood up casually looking around No one else was in the gardens and she was far enough inside that it would take minutes for anyone to get to her Shallan sat back down setting aside her drawing pad and pencil I might as well see if I can figure out how to use it she thought Maybe theres no need to keep searching the Palanaeum for a solution So long as she stood up and glanced about periodically she could be certain she wouldnt be approached or seen by accident She removed the forbidden device It was heavy in her hand Solid Taking a deep breath she looped the chains over her fingers and around her wrist the gemstones set against the back of her hand The metal was cold the chains loose She flexed her hand pulling the fabrial tight Shed anticipated a feeling of power Prickles on her skin perhaps or a sense of strength and might But there was nothing She tapped the three gemstonesshed placed her smokestone into the third setting Some other fabrials like spanreeds worked when you tapped the stones But that was foolish as shed never seen Jasnah do that The woman just closed her eyes and touched something Soulcasting it Smoke crystal and fire were what this Soulcaster was best at Only once had she seen Jasnah create anything else Hesitant Shallan took a piece of broken shalebark from the base of one of the plants She held it up in her freehand then closed her eyes Become smoke she commanded Nothing happened Become crystal she commanded instead She cracked an eye There was no change Fire Burn Youre fire You She paused realizing the stupidity of that A mysteriously burned hand No that wouldnt be at all suspicious Instead she focused on crystal She closed her eyes again holding the image of a piece of quartz in her mind She tried to will the shalebark to change Nothing happened so she just tried focusing imagining the shalebark transforming After a few minutes of failure she tried making the pouch change instead then tried the bench then tried one of her hairs Nothing worked Shallan checked to make certain she was still alone then sat down frustrated Nan Balat had asked Luesh how the devices worked and hed said that it was easier to show than explain Hed promised to give them answers if she actually managed to steal Jasnahs Now he was dead Was she doomed to carry this one back to her family only to immediately give it away to those dangerous men never using it to gain wealth to protect her house All because they didnt know how to activate it The other fabrials shed used had been simple to activate but those were constructed by contemporary artifabrians Soulcasters were fabrials from ancient times They wouldnt employ modern methods of activation She stared at the glowing gemstones suspended on the back of her hand How would she figure out the method of using a tool thousands of years old one forbidden to any but ardents She slid the Soulcaster back into her safepouch It seemed she was back to searching the Palanaeum That or asking Kabsal But would she manage that without looking suspicious She broke out his bread and jam eating and thinking idly If Kabsal didnt know and if she couldnt find the answers by the time she left Kharbranth were there other options If she took the artifact to the Veden kingor maybe the ardentsmight they be able to protect her family in exchange for the gift After all she couldnt really be blamed for stealing from a heretic and so long as Jasnah didnt know who had the Soulcaster they would be safe For some reason that made her feel even worse Stealing the Soulcaster to save her family was one thing but turning it over to the very ardents whom Jasnah disdained It seemed a greater betrayal Yet another difficult decision Well then she thought its a good thing Jasnah is so determined to train me in how to deal with those By the time all this is done I should be quite the expert Death upon the lips Sound upon the air Char upon the skin From The Last Desolation by Ambrian line 335 Kaladin stumbled into the light shading his eyes against the burning sun his bare feet feeling the transition from cold indoor stone to sunwarmed stone outside The air was lightly humid not muggy as it had been in previous weeks He rested his hand on the wooden doorframe his legs quivering rebelliously his arms feeling as if hed carried a bridge for three days straight He breathed deeply His side should have blazed with pain but he felt only a residual soreness Some of his deeper cuts were still scabbed over but the smaller ones had vanished completely His head was surprisingly clear He didnt even have a headache He rounded the side of the barrack feeling stronger with each step though he kept his hand on the wall Lopen followed behind the Herdazian had been watching over Kaladin when he awoke I should be dead Kaladin thought What is going on On the other side of the barrack he was surprised to find the men carrying their bridge in daily practice Rock ran at the front center giving the marching beat as Kaladin had once done They reached the other side of the lumberyard and turned around charging back Only when they were almost past the barrack did one of the men in frontMoashnotice Kaladin He froze nearly causing the entire bridge crew to trip What is wrong with you Torfin yelled from behind head enveloped by the wood of the bridge Moash didnt listen He ducked out from under the bridge looking at Kaladin with wide eyes Rock gave a hasty shout for the men to put down the bridge More saw him adopting the same reverent expressions as Moash Hobber and Peet their wounds sufficiently healed had started practicing with the others That was good Theyd be drawing pay again The men walked up to Kaladin silent in their leather vests They kept their distance hesitant as if he were fragile Or holy Kaladin was barechested his nearly healed wounds exposed and wore only his kneelength bridgemans trousers You really need to practice what to do if one of you trips or stumbles men Kaladin said When Moash stopped abruptly you all about fell over That could be a disaster on the field They stared at him incredulous and he couldnt help but smile In a moment they crowded around him laughing and thumping him on the back It wasnt an entirely appropriate welcome for a sick man particularly when Rock did it but Kaladin did appreciate their enthusiasm Only Teft didnt join in The aging bridgeman stood at the side arms folded He seemed concerned Teft Kaladin asked You all right Teft snorted but showed a hint of a grin I just figure those lads dont bathe often enough for me to want to get close enough for a hug No offense Kaladin laughed I understand His last bath had been the highstorm The highstorm The other bridgemen continued to laugh asking how he felt proclaiming that Rock would have to fix something extra special for their nightly fireside meal Kaladin smiled and nodded assuring them he felt well but he was remembering the storm He recalled it distinctly Holding to the ring atop the building his head down and eyes closed against the pelting torrent He remembered Syl standing protectively before him as if she could turn back the storm itself He couldnt see her about now Where was she He also remembered the face The Stormfather himself Surely not A delusion Yesyes hed certainly been delusional Memories of deathspren were blended with relived parts of his lifeand both mixed with strange sudden shocks of strengthicy cold but refreshing It had been like the cold air of a crisp morning after a long night in a stuffy room or like rubbing the sap of gulket leaves on sore muscles making them feel warm and cold at the same time He could remember those moments so clearly What had caused them The fever How long he said checking over the bridgemen counting them Thirtythree counting Lopen and the silent Dabbid Almost all were accounted for Impossible If his ribs were healed then he must have been unconscious for three weeks at least How many bridge runs Ten days Moash said Impossible Kaladin said My wounds Is why were so surprised to see you up and walking Rock said laughing You must have bones like granite Is my name you should be having Kaladin leaned back against the wall Nobody corrected Moash An entire crew of men couldnt lose track of the weeks like that Idolir and Treff he asked We lost them Moash said growing solemn We did two bridge runs while you were unconscious Nobody badly wounded but two dead Wewe didnt know how to help them That made the men grow subdued But death was the way of bridgemen and they couldnt afford to dwell for long on the lost Kaladin did decide however that hed need to train a few of the others in healing But how was he up and walking Had he been less injured than hed assumed Hesitantly he prodded at his side feeling for broken ribs Just a little sore Other than the weakness he felt as healthy as he ever had Perhaps he should have paid a little more attention to his mothers religious teachings As the men turned back to talking and celebrating he noticed the looks they gave him Respectful reverent They remembered what hed said before the highstorm Looking back Kaladin realized hed been a little delirious It now seemed an incredibly arrogant proclamation not to mention that it smelled of prophecy If the ardents discovered that Well he couldnt undo what hed done Hed just have to continue You were already balancing over a chasm Kaladin thought to himself Did you have to scale an even higher cliffside A sudden mournful horn call sounded across the camp The bridgemen fell silent The horn sounded twice more Figures Natam said Were on duty Kaladin asked Yeah Moash said Line up Rock snapped You know what to do Lets show Captain Kaladin that we havent forgotten how to do this Captain Kaladin Kaladin asked as the men lined up Sure gancho Lopen said from beside him speaking with that quick accent that seemed so at odds with his nonchalant attitude They tried to make Rock bridgeleader sure but we just started calling you captain and him squadleader Made Gaz angry Lopen grinned Kaladin nodded The other men were so joyous but he was finding it difficult to share their mood As they formed up around their bridge he began to realize the source of his melancholy His men were right back where theyd started Or worse He was weakened and injured and had offended the highprince himself Sadeas would not be pleased when he learned that Kaladin had survived his fever The bridgemen were still destined to be cut down one by one The side carry had been a failure He hadnt saved his men hed just given them a short stay of execution Bridgemen arent supposed to survive He suspected why that was Gritting his teeth he let go of the barrack wall and crossed to where the bridgemen stood in line leaders of the subsquads doing a quick check of their vests and sandals Rock eyed Kaladin And what is this thing you believe you are doing Im joining you Kaladin said And what would you tell one of the men if they had just gotten up from a week with the fevers Kaladin hesitated Im not like the other men he thought then regretted it He couldnt start believing himself invincible To run now with the crew as weak as he was would be sheer idiocy Youre right You can help me and the moolie carry water gancho Lopen said Were a team now Go on every run Kaladin nodded All right Rock eyed him If Im feeling too weak at the end of the permanent bridges Ill go back I promise Rock nodded reluctantly The men marched under the bridge to the staging area and Kaladin joined Lopen and Dabbid filling waterskins Kaladin stood at the edge of the precipice hands clasped behind his back sandaled toes at the very edge of the cliff The chasm stared up at him but he did not meet its gaze He was focused on the battle being waged on the next plateau This approach had been an easy one theyd arrived at the same time as the Parshendi Instead of bothering to kill bridgemen the Parshendi had taken a defensive position in the center of the plateau around the chrysalis Now Sadeass men fought them Kaladins brow was slick with sweat from the days heat and he still felt a lingering exhaustion from his sickness Yet it wasnt nearly as bad as it should have been The surgeons son was baffled For the moment the soldier overruled the surgeon He was transfixed by the battle Alethi spearmen in leathers and breastplates pressed a curved line against the Parshendi warriors Most Parshendi used battleaxes or hammers though a few wielded swords or clubs They all had that redorange armor growing from their skin and they fought in pairs singing all the while It was the worst kind of battle the kind that was close Often youd lose far fewer men in a skirmish where your enemies quickly gained the upper hand When that happened your commander would order the retreat to cut his losses But close battlesthey were brutal bloodsoaked things Watching the fightingthe bodies dropped to the rocks the weapons flashing the men pushed off the plateaureminded him of his first fights as a spearman His commander had been shocked at how easily Kaladin dealt with seeing blood Kaladins father would have been shocked at how easily Kaladin spilled it There was a big difference between his battles in Alethkar and the fights on the Shattered Plains There hed been surrounded by the worstor at least worsttrainedsoldiers in Alethkar Men who didnt hold their lines And yet for all their disorder those fights had made sense to him These here on the Shattered Plains still did not That had been his miscalculation Hed changed battlefield tactics before understanding them He would not make that mistake again Rock stepped up beside Kaladin joined by Sigzil The thicklimbed Horneater made for quite a contrast to the short quiet Azish man Sigzils skin was a deep brownnot true black like some parshmens He tended to keep to himself Is bad battle Rock said folding his arms The soldiers will not be happy whether or not they win Kaladin nodded absently listening to the yells screams and curses Why do they fight Rock For money Rock said And for vengeance You should know this thing Is it not your king who Parshendi killed Oh I understand why we fight Kaladin said But the Parshendi Why do they fight Rock grinned Is because they dont very much like the idea of being beheaded for killing your king I should think Very unaccommodating of them Kaladin smiled though he found mirth unnatural while watching men die He had been trained too long by his father for any death to leave him unmoved Perhaps But then why do they fight for the gemhearts Their numbers are dwindling because of skirmishes like these You know this thing Rock asked They raid less frequently than they used to Kaladin said People talk about it in camp And they dont strike as close to the Alethi side as they once did Rock nodded thoughtfully It seems logical Ha Perhaps we will soon win this fight and be going home No Sigzil said softly He had a very formal way of speaking with barely a hint of an accent What language did the Azish speak anyway Their kingdom was so distant that Kaladin had only ever met one other I doubt that And I can tell you why they fight Kaladin Really They must have Soulcasters They need the gemstones for the same reason we do To make food It sounds reasonable Kaladin said hands still clasped behind his back feet in a wide stance Parade rest still felt natural to him Just conjecture but a reasonable one Let me ask you something else then Why cant bridgemen have shields Because this thing makes us too slow Rock said No Sigzil said They could send bridgemen with shields out in front of the bridges running in front of us It wouldnt slow anyone down Yes you would have to field more bridgemenbut youd save enough lives with those shields to make up for the larger roster Kaladin nodded Sadeas fields more of us than he needs already In most cases more bridges land than he needs But why Sigzil asked Because we make good targets Kaladin said softly understanding Were put out in front to draw Parshendi attention Of course we are Rock said shrugging Armies always do these things The poorest and the least trained go first I know Kaladin said but usually theyre at least given some measure of protection Dont you see Were not just an expendable initial wave Were bait Were exposed so the Parshendi cant help but fire at us It allows the regular soldiers to approach without being hurt The Parshendi archers are aiming at the bridgemen Rock frowned Shields would make us less tempting Kaladin said Thats why he forbids them Perhaps Sigzil said from the side thoughtful But it seems foolish to waste troops Actually it isnt foolish Kaladin said If you have to repeatedly attack fortified positions you cant afford to lose your trained troops Dont you see Sadeas has only a limited number of trained men But untrained ones are easy to find Each arrow that strikes down a bridgeman is one that doesnt hit a soldier youve spent a great deal of money outfitting and training Thats why its better for Sadeas to field a large number of bridgemen rather than a smallerbut protectednumber He should have seen it earlier He had been distracted by how important bridgemen were to the battles If the bridges didnt arrive at the chasms then the army couldnt cross But each bridge crew was kept well stocked with bodies and twice as many bridge crews were sent on an assault as were needed Seeing a bridge fall must give the Parshendi a great sense of satisfaction and they usually got to drop two or three bridges on every bad chasm run Sometimes more So long as bridgemen were dying and the Parshendi didnt spend their time firing on soldiers Sadeas had reason to keep the bridgemen vulnerable The Parshendi should have seen through it but it was very hard to turn your arrow away from the unarmored man carrying the siege equipment The Parshendi were said to be unsophisticated fighters Indeed watching the battle on the other plateaustudying it focusinghe saw that was true Where the Alethi maintained a straight disciplined lineeach man protecting his partnersthe Parshendi attacked in independent pairs The Alethi had superior technique and tactics True each of the Parshendi was superior in strength and their skill with those axes was remarkable But Sadeass Alethi troops were well trained in modern formations Once they got a footholdand if they could prolong the battletheir discipline often saw them to victory The Parshendi havent fought in largescale battles before this war Kaladin decided Theyre used to smaller skirmishes perhaps against other villages or clans Several of the other bridgemen joined Kaladin Rock and Sigzil Before long the majority of them were standing there some imitating Kaladins stance It took another hour before the battle was won Sadeas proved victorious but Rock was right The soldiers were grim theyd lost many friends this day It was a tired battered group of spearmen that Kaladin and the others led back to camp A few hours later Kaladin sat on a chunk of wood beside Bridge Fours nightly fire Syl sat on his knee having taken the form of a small translucent blue and white flame Shed come to him during the march back spinning around gleefully to see him up and walking but had given no explanation for her absence The real fire crackled and popped Rocks large pot bubbling on top of it some flamespren dancing on the logs Every couple of seconds someone asked Rock if the stew was done yet often banging on his bowl with a goodnatured smack of the spoon Rock said nothing stirring They all knew that nobody ate until he declared the stew finished he was very particular about not serving inferior food The air smelled of boiling dumplings The men were laughing Their bridgeleader had survived execution and todays bridge run hadnt cost a single casualty Spirits were high Except for Kaladins He understood now He understood just how futile their struggle was He understood why Sadeas hadnt bothered to acknowledge Kaladins survival He was already a bridgeman and being a bridgeman was a death sentence Kaladin had hoped to show Sadeas that his bridge crew could be efficient and useful Hed hoped to prove that they deserved protectionshields armor training Kaladin thought that if they acted like soldiers maybe they would be seen as soldiers None of that would work A bridgeman who survived was by definition a bridgeman who had failed His men laughed and enjoyed the fire They trusted him Hed done the impossible surviving a highstorm wounded tied to a wall Surely he would perform another miracle this time for them They were good men but they thought like foot soldiers The officers and the lighteyes would worry about the long term The men were fed and happy and that was enough for now Not for Kaladin He found himself facetoface with the man hed left behind The one hed abandoned that night hed decided not to throw himself into the chasm A man with haunted eyes a man who had given up on caring or hoping A walking corpse Im going to fail them he thought He couldnt let them continue running bridges dying off one by one But he also couldnt think of an alternative And so their laughter tore at him One of the menMapsstood holding up his arms quieting the others It was the time between moons and so he was lit mostly by the firelight there was a spray of stars in the sky above Several of those moved about the tiny pinpricks of light chasing after one another zipping around like distant glowing insects Starspren They were rare Maps was a flatfaced fellow his beard bushy his eyebrows thick Everyone called him Maps because of the birthmark on his chest that he swore was an exact map of Alethkar though Kaladin hadnt been able to see the resemblance Maps cleared his throat Its a good night a special night and all Weve got our bridgeleader back Several of the men clapped Kaladin tried not to show how sick he felt inside Weve got good food coming Maps said He eyed Rock It is coming aint it Rock Is coming Rock said stirring Youre sure about that We could go on another bridge run Give you a little extra time you know five or six more hours Rock gave him a fierce look The men laughed several banging their bowls with their spoons Maps chuckled then he reached to the ground behind the stone he was using for a seat He pulled out a paperwrapped package and tossed it to Rock Surprised the tall Horneater barely caught it nearly dropping it into the stew From all of us Maps said a little awkwardly for making us stew each night Dont think we havent noticed how hard you work on it We relax while you cook And you always serve everyone else first So we bought you something to thank you He wiped his nose on his arm spoiling the moment slightly and sat back down Several of the other bridgemen thumped him on the back complimenting his speech Rock unwrapped the package and stared into it for a long while Kaladin leaned forward trying to get a look at the contents Rock reached in and held the item up It was a straight razor of gleaming silvery steel there was a length of wood covering the sharp side Rock pulled this off inspecting the blade You airsick fools he said softly Is beautiful Theres a piece of polished steel too said Peet For a mirror And some beard soap and a leather strop for sharpening Amazingly Rock grew tearyeyed He turned away from the pot bearing his gifts Stew is ready he said Then he ran into the barrack building The men sat quietly Stormfather youthful Dunny finally said you think we did the right thing I mean the way he complains and all I think it was perfect Teft said Just give the big lout some time to recover Sorry we didnt get you nothin sir Maps said to Kaladin We didnt know youd be awake and all Its all right Kaladin said Well Skar said Is someone going to serve that stew or will we all just sit here hungry until it burns Dunny jumped up grabbing the ladle The men gathered around the pot jostling one another as Dunny served Without Rock there to snap at them and keep them in line it was something of a melee Only Sigzil did not join in The quiet darkskinned man sat to the side eyes reflecting the flames Kaladin rose He was worriedterrified reallythat he might become that wretch again The one who had given up on caring because he saw no alternative So he sought conversation walking over toward Sigzil His motion disturbed Syl who sniffed and buzzed up onto his shoulder She still held the form of a flickering flame having that on his shoulder was even more distracting He didnt say anything if she knew it bothered him shed be likely to do it more She was still a windspren after all Kaladin sat down next to Sigzil Not hungry They are more eager than I Sigzil said If previous evenings are a reliable guide there will still be enough for me once they have filled their bowls Kaladin nodded I appreciated your analysis out on the plateau today I am good at that sometimes Youre educated You speak like it and you act like it Sigzil hesitated Yes he finally said Among my people it is not a sin for a male to be keen of mind It isnt a sin for Alethi either My experience is that you care only about wars and the art of killing And what have you seen of us besides our army Not much Sigzil admitted So a man of education Kaladin said thoughtfully In a bridge crew My education was never completed Neither was mine Sigzil looked at him curious I apprenticed as a surgeon Kaladin said Sigzil nodded thick dark hair falling around his shoulders Hed been one of the only bridgemen who bothered shaving Now that Rock had a razor maybe that would change A surgeon he said I can not say that is surprising considering how you handled the wounded The men say that youre secretly a lighteyes of very high rank What But my eyes are dark brown Pardon me Sigzil said I didnt speak the right wordyou dont have the right word in your language To you a lighteyes is the same as a leader In other kingdoms though other things make a man acurse this Alethi language A man of high birth A brightlord only without the eyes Anyway the men think you must have been raised outside of Alethkar As a leader Sigzil looked back at the others They were beginning to sit back down attacking their stew with vigor Its the way you lead so naturally the way you make others want to listen to you These are things they associate with lighteyes And so they have invented a past for you You will have a difficult time disabusing them of it now Sigzil eyed him Assuming it is a fabrication I was there in the chasm the day you used that spear A spear Kaladin said A darkeyed soldiers weapon not a lighteyess sword To many bridgemen the difference is minimal All are so far above us So what is your story Sigzil smirked I wondered if you were going to ask The others mentioned that you have pried into their origins I like to know the men I lead And if some of us are murderers Sigzil asked quietly Then Im in good company Kaladin said If it was a lighteyes you killed then I might buy you a drink Not a lighteyes Sigzil said And he is not dead Then youre not a murderer Kaladin said Not for want of trying Sigzils eyes grew distant I thought for certain I had succeeded It was not the wisest choice I made My master He trailed off Is he the one you tried to kill No Kaladin waited but no more information was forthcoming A scholar he thought Or at least a man of learning There has to be a way to use this Find a way out of this death trap Kaladin Use what you have There has to be a way You were right about the bridgemen Sigzil said We are sent to die It is the only reasonable explanation There is a place in the world Marabethia Have you heard of it No Kaladin said It is beside the sea to the north in the Selay lands The people are known for their great fondness for debate At each intersection in the city they have small pedestals on which a man can stand and proclaim his arguments It is said that everyone in Marabethia carries a pouch with an overripe fruit just in case they pass a proclaimer with whom they disagree Kaladin frowned He hadnt heard so many words from Sigzil in all the time theyd been bridgemen together What you said earlier on the plateau Sigzil continued eyes forward it made me think of the Marabethians You see they have a curious way of treating condemned criminals They dangle them over the seaside cliff near the city down near the water at high tide with a cut sliced in each cheek There is a particular species of greatshell in the depths there The creatures are known for their succulent flavor and of course they have gemhearts Not nearly as large as the ones in these chasmfiends but still nice So the criminals they become bait A criminal may demand execution instead but they say if you hang there for a week and are not eaten then you can go free And does that often happen Kaladin asked Sigzil shook his head Never But the prisoners almost always take the chance The Marabethians have a saying for someone who refuses to see the truth of a situation You have eyes of red and blue they say Red for the blood dripping Blue for the water It is said that these two things are all the prisoners see Usually they are attacked within one day And yet most still wish to take that chance They prefer the false hope Eyes of red and blue Kaladin thought imagining the morbid picture You do a good work Sigzil said rising picking up his bowl At first I hated you for lying to the men But I have come to see that a false hope makes them happy What you do is like giving medicine to a sick man to ease his pain until he dies Now these men can spend their last days in laughter You are a healer indeed Kaladin Stormblessed Kaladin wanted to object to say that it wasnt a false hope but he couldnt Not with his heart in his stomach Not with what he knew A moment later Rock burst from the barrack I feel like a true aliltikii again he proclaimed holding aloft his razor My friends you can not know what you have done Someday I will take you to the Peaks and show you the hospitality of kings Despite all of his complaining he hadnt shaved his beard off completely He had left long redblond sideburns which curved down to his chin The tip of the chin itself was shaved clean as were his lips On the tall ovalfaced man the look was quite distinctive Ha Rock said striding up to the fire He grabbed the nearest men there and hugged them both to him causing Bisig to nearly spill his stew I will make you all family for this A peak dwellers humakaaban is his pride I feel like a true man again Here This razor belongs not to me but to us all Any who wishes to use it must do so Is my honor to share with you The men laughed and a few took him up on the offer Kaladin wasnt one of them It justdidnt seem to matter to him He accepted the bowl of stew Dunny brought him but didnt eat Sigzil chose not to sit back down beside him retreating to the other side of the campfire Eyes of red and blue Kaladin thought I dont know if that fits us For him to have eyes of red and blue Kaladin would have to believe that there was at least a small chance the bridge crew could survive This night Kaladin had trouble convincing himself Hed never been an optimist He saw the world as it was or he tried to That was a problem though when the truth he saw was so terrible Oh Stormfather he thought feeling the crushing weight of despair as he stared down at his bowl Im falling back to the wretch I was Im losing my grip on this on myself He couldnt carry the hopes of all the bridgemen He just wasnt strong enough FIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO Kaladin pushed past the shrieking Laral and stumbled into the surgery room Even after years working with his father the amount of blood in the room was shocking It was as if someone had dumped out a bucket of bright red paint The scent of burned flesh hung in the air Lirin worked frantically on Brightlord Rillir Roshones son An evillooking tusklike thing jutted from the young mans abdomen and his lower right leg was crushed It hung by only a few tendons splinters of bone poking out like reeds from the waters of a pond Brightlord Roshone himself lay on the side table groaning eyes squeezed shut as he held his leg which was pierced by another of the bony spears Blood leaked from his improvised bandage flowed down the side of the table and dripped to the floor to mix with his sons Kaladin stood in the doorway gaping Laral continued to scream She clutched the doorframe as several of Roshones guards tried to pull her away Her wails were frantic Do something Work harder He cant He was where it happened and I dont care and let me go The garbled phrases degenerated into screeches The guards finally got her away Kaladin his father snapped I need you Shocked into motion Kaladin entered the room scrubbing his hands then gathering bandages from the cabinet stepping in blood He caught a glimpse of Rillirs face much of the skin on the right side had been scraped off The eyelid was gone the blue eye itself sliced open at the front deflated like the skin of a grape pressed for wine Kaladin hastened to his father with the bandages His mother appeared at the doorway a moment later Tien behind her She raised a hand to her mouth then pulled Tien away He stumbled looking woozy She returned in a moment without him Water Kaladin Lirin cried Hesina fetch more Quickly His mother jumped to help though she rarely assisted in the surgery anymore Her hands shook as she grabbed one of the buckets and ran outside Kaladin took the other bucket which was full to his father as Lirin eased the length of bone from the young lighteyess gut Rillirs remaining eye fluttered head quivering What is that Kaladin asked pressing the bandage to the wound as his father tossed the strange object aside Whitespine tusk his father said Water Kaladin grabbed a sponge dunked it in the bucket and used it to squeeze water into Rillirs gut wound That washed away the blood giving Lirin a good look at the damage He quested with his fingers as Kaladin got some needle and thread ready There was already a tourniquet on the leg Full amputation would come later Lirin hesitated fingers inside the gaping hole in Rillirs belly Kaladin cleaned the wound again He looked up at his father concerned Lirin pulled his fingers out and walked to Brightlord Roshone Bandages Kaladin he said curtly Kaladin hurried over though he shot a look over his shoulder at Rillir The oncehandsome young lighteyes trembled again spasming Father Bandages Lirin said What are you doing surgeon Roshone bellowed What of my son Painspren swarmed around him Your son is dead Lirin said yanking the tusk free from Roshones leg The lighteyes bellowed in agony though Kaladin couldnt tell if that was because of the tusk or his son Roshone clenched his jaw as Kaladin pressed the bandage down on his leg Lirin dunked his hands in the water bucket then quickly wiped them with knobweed sap to frighten off rotspren My son is not dead Roshone growled I can see him moving Tend to him surgeon Kaladin get the dazewater Lirin ordered gathering his sewing needle Kaladin hurried to the back of the room steps splashing blood and threw open the far cupboard He took out a small flask of clear liquid What are you doing Roshone bellowed trying to sit up Look at my son Almighty above look at him Kaladin turned hesitantly pausing as he poured dazewater on a bandage Rillir was spasming more violently I work under three guidelines Roshone Lirin said forcibly pressing the lighteyes down against his table The guidelines every surgeon uses when choosing between two patients If the wounds are equal treat the youngest first Then see to my son If the wounds are not equally threatening Lirin continued treat the worst wound first As Ive been telling you The third guideline supersedes them both Roshone Lirin said leaning down A surgeon must know when someone is beyond their ability to help Im sorry Roshone I would save him if I could I promise you But I can not No Roshone said struggling again Kaladin Quickly Lirin said Kaladin dashed over He pressed the bandage of dazewater to Roshones chin and mouth just below the nose forcing the lighteyed man to breathe the fumes Kaladin held his own breath as hed been trained Roshone bellowed and screamed but the two of them held him down and he was weak from blood loss Soon his bellows became softer In seconds he was speaking in gibberish and grinning to himself Lirin turned back to the leg wound while Kaladin went to throw away the dazewater bandage No Administer it to Rillir His father didnt look away from his work Its the only mercy we can give him Kaladin nodded and used the dazewater bandage on the wounded youth Rillirs breathing grew less frantic though he didnt seem conscious enough to notice the effects Then Kaladin threw the bandage with the dazewater into the brazier heat negated the effects The white puffy bandage wrinkled and browned in the fire steam streaming off it as the edges burst into flame Kaladin returned with the sponge and washed out Roshones wound as Lirin prodded at it There were a few shards of tusk trapped inside and Lirin muttered to himself getting out his tongs and razorsharp knife Damnation can take them all Lirin said pulling out the first sliver of tusk Behind him Rillir fell still Isnt sending half of us to war enough for them Do they have to seek death even when theyre living in a quiet township Roshone should never have gone looking for the storming whitespine He was looking for it They went hunting it Lirin spat Wistiow and I used to joke about lighteyes like them If you cant kill men you kill beasts Well this is what you found Roshone Father Kaladin said softly Hes not going to be pleased with you when he awakes The brightlord was humming softly lying back eyes closed Lirin didnt respond He yanked out another fragment of tusk and Kaladin washed out the wound His father pressed his fingers to the side of the large puncture inspecting it There was one more sliver of tusk jutting from a muscle inside the wound Right beside that muscle thumped the femoral artery the largest in the leg Lirin reached in with his knife carefully cutting free the sliver of tusk Then he paused for a moment the edge of his blade just hairs from the artery If that were cut Kaladin thought Roshone would be dead in minutes He was only alive right now because the tusk had missed the artery Lirins normally steady hand quivered Then he glanced up at Kaladin He withdrew the knife without touching the artery then reached in with his tongs to pull the sliver free He tossed it aside then calmly reached for his thread and needle Behind them Rillir had stopped breathing That evening Kaladin sat on the steps to his house hands in his lap Roshone had been returned to his estate to be cared for by his personal servants His sons corpse was cooling in the crypt below and a messenger had been sent to request a Soulcaster for the body On the horizon the sun was red as blood Everywhere Kaladin looked the world was red The door to the surgery closed and his fatherlooking as exhausted as Kaladin felttottered out He eased himself down sighing as he sat beside Kaladin looking at the sun Did it look like blood to him too They didnt speak as the sun slowly sank before them Why was it most colorful when it was about to vanish for the night Was it angry at being forced belong the horizon Or was it a showman giving a performance before retiring Why was the most colorful part of peoples bodiesthe brightness of their bloodhidden beneath the skin never to be seen unless something went wrong No Kaladin thought The blood isnt the most colorful part of a body The eyes can be colorful too The blood and the eyes Both representations of ones heritage And ones nobility I saw inside a man today Kaladin finally said Not for the first time Lirin said and certainly not for the last Im proud of you I expected to find you here crying as you usually do when we lose a patient Youre learning When I said I saw inside a man Kaladin said I wasnt talking about the wounds Lirin didnt respond for a moment I see You would have let him die if I hadnt been there wouldnt you Silence Why didnt you Kaladin said It would have solved so much It wouldnt have been letting him die It would have been murdering him You could have just let him bleed then claimed you couldnt save him Nobody would have questioned you You could have done it No Lirin said staring at the sunset No I couldnt have But why Because Im not a killer son Kaladin frowned Lirin had a distant look in his eyes Somebody has to start Somebody has to step forward and do what is right because it is right If nobody starts then others can not follow The lighteyes do their best to kill themselves and to kill us The others still havent brought back Alds and Milp Roshone just left them there Alds and Milp two townsmen had been on the hunt but hadnt returned with the party bearing the two wounded lighteyes Roshone had been so worried about Rillir that hed left them behind so he could travel quickly The lighteyes dont care about life Lirin said So I must Thats another reason why I wouldnt have let Roshone die even if you hadnt been there Though looking at you did strengthen me I wish it hadnt Kaladin said You mustnt say such things Why not Because son We have to be better than they are He sighed standing You should sleep I may need you when the others return with Alds and Milp That wasnt likely the two townsmen were probably dead by now Their wounds were said to be pretty bad Plus the whitespines were still out there Lirin went inside but didnt compel Kaladin to follow Would I have let him die Kaladin wondered Maybe even flicked that knife to hasten him on his way Roshone had been nothing but a blight since his arrival but did that justify killing him No Cutting that artery wouldnt have been justified But what obligation had Kaladin to help Withholding his aid wasnt the same thing as killing It just wasnt Kaladin thought it through a dozen different ways pondering his fathers words What he found shocked him He honestly would have let Roshone die on that table It would have been better for Kaladins family it would have been better for the entire town Kaladins father had once laughed at his sons desire to go to war Indeed now that Kaladin had decided he would become a surgeon on his own terms his thoughts and actions of earlier years felt childish to him But Lirin thought Kaladin incapable of killing You can hardly step on a cremling without feeling guilty son hed said Ramming your spear into a man would be nowhere near as easy as you seem to think But his father was wrong It was a stunning frightening revelation This wasnt idle fancy or daydreaming about the glory of battle This was real At that moment Kaladin knew he could kill if he needed to Some peoplelike a festering finger or a leg shattered beyond repairjust needed to be removed Like a highstorm regular in their coming yet always unexpected The word Desolation is used twice in reference to their appearances See pages 57 59 and 64 of Tales by Hearthlight Ive made my decision Shallan declared Jasnah looked up from her research In an unusual moment of deference she put aside her books and sat with her back to the Veil regarding Shallan Very well What you did was both legal and right in the strict sense of the words Shallan said But it was not moral and it certainly wasnt ethical So morality and legality are distinct Nearly all of the philosophies agree they are But what do you think Shallan hesitated Yes You can be moral without following the law and you can be immoral while following the law But you also said what I did was right but not moral The distinction between those two seems less easy to define An action can be right Shallan said It is simply something done viewed without considering intent Killing four men in selfdefense is right But not moral Morality applies to your intent and the greater context of the situation Seeking out men to kill is an immoral act Jasnah regardless of the eventual outcome Jasnah tapped her desktop with a fingernail She was wearing her glove the gemstones of the broken Soulcaster bulging beneath It had been two weeks Surely shed discovered that it didnt work How could she be so calm Was she trying to fix it in secret Perhaps she feared that if she revealed it was broken she would lose political power Or had she realized that hers had been swapped for a different Soulcaster Could it be despite all odds that Jasnah just hadnt tried to use the Soulcaster Shallan needed to leave before too long But if she left before Jasnah discovered the swap she risked having the woman try her Soulcaster just after Shallan vanished bringing suspicion directly on her The anxious waiting was driving Shallan near to madness Finally Jasnah nodded then returned to her research You have nothing to say Shallan said I just accused you of murder No Jasnah said murder is a legal definition You said I killed unethically You think Im wrong I assume You are Jasnah said But I accept that you believe what you are saying and have put rational thought behind it I have looked over your notes and I believe you understand the various philosophies In some cases I think that you were quite insightful in your interpretation of them The lesson was instructive She opened her book Then thats it Of course not Jasnah said We will study philosophy further in the future for now Im satisfied that you have established a solid foundation in the topic But I still decided you were wrong I still think theres an absolute Truth out there Yes Jasnah said and it took you two weeks of struggling to come to that conclusion Jasnah looked up meeting Shallans eyes It wasnt easy was it No And you still wonder dont you Yes That is enough Jasnah narrowed her eyes slightly a consoling smile appearing on her lips If it helps you wrestle with your feelings child understand that I was trying to do good I sometimes wonder if I should accomplish more with my Soulcaster She turned back to her reading You are free for the rest of the day Shallan blinked What Free Jasnah said You may go Do as you please Youll spend it drawing beggars and barmaids I suspect but you may choose Be off with you Yes Brightness Thank you Jasnah waved in dismissal and Shallan grabbed her portfolio and hastened from the alcove She hadnt had any free time since the day shed gone sketching on her own in the gardens Shed been gently chided for that Jasnah had left her in her rooms to rest not go out sketching Shallan waited impatiently as the parshman porters lowered her lift to the Veils groundfloor then hurried out into the cavernous central hall A long walk later she approached the guest quarters nodding to the masterservants who served there Half guards half concierges they monitored who entered and left She used her thick brass key to unlock the door to Jasnahs rooms then slipped inside and locked the door behind her The small sitting chamberfurnished with a rug and two chairs beside the hearthwas lit by topazes The table still contained a halffull cup of orange wine from Jasnahs late research the night before along with a few crumbs of bread on a plate Shallan hurried to her own chamber then shut the door and took the Soulcaster out of her safepouch The warm glow of the gemstones bathed her face in white and red light They were large enoughand therefore bright enoughthat it was hard to look at them directly Each would be worth ten or twenty broams Shed been forced to hide them outside in the recent highstorm to infuse them and that had been its own source of anxiety She took a deep breath then knelt and slid a small wooden stick from under the bed A week and a half of practice and she still hadnt managed to make the Soulcaster dowell anything at all Shed tried tapping the gems twisting them shaking her hand and flexing her hand in exact mimicry of Jasnah Shed studied picture after picture shed drawn of the process She tried speaking concentrating and even begging However shed found a book the day before that had offered what seemed like a useful tip It claimed that humming of all things could make a Soulcasting more effective It was just a passing reference but it was more than shed found anywhere else She sat down on her bed and forced herself to concentrate She closed her eyes holding the stick imagining it transforming into quartz Then she began humming Nothing happened She kept on humming though trying different notes concentrating as hard as she could She kept her attention on the task for a good half hour but eventually her mind began to wander A new worry began to nibble at her Jasnah was one of the most brilliant insightful scholars in the world Shed put the Soulcaster out where it could be taken Had she intentionally duped Shallan with a fake It seemed an awful lot of trouble to go through Why not just spring the trap and reveal Shallan as a thief The fact that she couldnt get the Soulcaster to work left her straining plausibility for explanations She stopped humming and opened her eyes The stick had not changed So much for that tip she thought setting the stick aside with a sigh Shed been so hopeful She lay back on the bed resting staring up at the brown stone ceiling cutlike the rest of the Conclavedirectly out of the mountain Here the stone had been left intentionally rough evoking the roof of a cave It was quite beautiful in a subtle way shed never noticed before the colors and contours of the rock rippling like a disturbed pond She took a sheet from her portfolio and began to sketch the rock patterns One sketch to calm her and then she would get back to the Soulcaster Perhaps she should try it on her other hand again She couldnt capture the colors of the strata not in charcoal but she could record the fascinating way the strata wove together Like a work of art Had some stoneworker cut this ceiling intentionally crafting this subtle creation or was it an accident of nature She smiled imagining some overworked stonecutter noticing the beautiful grain of the rock and deciding to form a wave pattern for his own personal wonder and sense of beauty What are you Shallan yelped sitting up sketchpad bouncing free of her lap Someone had whispered those words Shed heard them distinctly Who is there she asked Silence Whos there she said more loudly her heart beating quickly Something sounded outside her door from the sitting room Shallan jumped hiding the hand wearing the Soulcaster under a pillow as the door creaked open revealing a wizened palace maid darkeyed and dressed in a white and black uniform Oh dear the woman exclaimed I had no idea you were here Brightness She bowed low A palace maid Here to clean the room an everyday occurrence Focused on her meditation Shallan hadnt heard her enter Why did you speak to me Speak to you Brightness You No the voice had been a whisper and it had quite distinctly come from inside Shallans room It couldnt have been the maid She shivered and glanced about But that was foolish The tiny room was easily inspected There were no Voidbringers hiding in the corners or under her bed What then had she heard Noises from the woman cleaning obviously Shallans mind had just interpreted those random sounds as words Forcing herself to relax Shallan looked out past the maid into the sitting room The woman had cleaned up the wineglass and crumbs A broom leaned against the wall In addition Jasnahs door was cracked open Were you in Brightness Jasnahs room Shallan demanded Yes Brightness the woman said Tidying up the desk making the bed Brightness Jasnah does not like people entering her room The maids have been told not to clean in there The king had promised that his maids were very carefully chosen and there had never been issues of theft but Jasnah still insisted that none enter her bedchamber The woman paled Im sorry Brightness I didnt hear I wasnt told Hush its all right Shallan said Youll want to go tell her what youve done She always notices if her things were moved It will be better for you if you go to her and explain YYes Brightness The woman bowed again In fact Shallan said something occurring to her You should go now No point putting it off The elderly maid sighed Yes of course Brightness She withdrew A few seconds later the outside door closed and locked Shallan leapt up pulling off the Soulcaster and stuffing it back in her safepouch She hurried outside heart thumping the strange voice forgotten as she seized the opportunity to look into Jasnahs room It was unlikely that Shallan would discover anything useful about the Soulcaster but she couldnt pass up the chancenot with the maid to blame for moving things She felt only a glimmer of guilt for this Shed already stolen from Jasnah Compared with that poking through her room was nothing The bedroom was larger than Shallans though it still felt cramped because of the unavoidable lack of windows Jasnahs bed a fourposter monstrosity took up half the space The vanity was against the far wall and beside it the dressing table from which Shallan had originally stolen the Soulcaster Other than a dresser the only other thing in the room was the desk books piled high on the left side Shallan never got a chance to look at Jasnahs notebooks Might she perhaps have taken notes on the Soulcaster Shallan sat at the desk hurriedly pulling open the top drawer and poking through the brushpens charcoal pencils and sheets of paper All were organized neatly and the paper was blank The bottom right drawer held ink and empty notebooks The bottom left drawer had a small collection of reference books That left the books on the top of the table Jasnah would have the majority of her notebooks with her as she worked Butyes there were still a few here Heart fluttering Shallan gathered up the three thin volumes and set them before her Notes on Urithiru the first one declared inside The notebook was fullit appearedof quotes from and notations about various books Jasnah had found All spoke of this place Urithiru Jasnah had mentioned it earlier to Kabsal Shallan put that book aside looking at the next hoping for mention of the Soulcaster This notebook was also filled to capacity but there was no title on it Shallan picked through reading some entries The ones of ash and fire who killed like a swarm relentless before the Heralds Noted in Masly page 337 Corroborated by Coldwin and Hasavah They take away the light wherever they lurk Skin that is burned Cormshen page 104 Innia in her recordings of childrens folktales speaks of the Voidbringers as being Like a highstorm regular in their coming yet always unexpected The word Desolation is used twice in reference to their appearances See pages 57 59 and 64 of Tales by Hearthlight They changed even as we fought them Like shadows they were that can transform as the flame dances Never underestimate them because of what you first see Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin a Radiant of the Order of Stonewards The sourceGuvlows Incarnateis generally held as reliable though this is from a copied fragment of The Poem of the Seventh Morning which has been lost They went on like that Pages and pages Jasnah had trained her in this method of note takingonce the notebook was filled each item would be evaluated again for reliability and usefulness and copied to different more specific notebooks Frowning Shallan looked through the final notebook It focused on Natanatan the Unclaimed Hills and the Shattered Plains It collected records of discoveries by hunters explorers or tradesmen searching for a river passage to New Natanan Of the three notebooks the largest was the one that focused on the Voidbringers The Voidbringers again Many people in more rural places whispered of them and other monsters of the dark The raspings or stormwhispers or even the dreaded nightspren Shallan had been taught by stern tutors that these were superstition fabrications of the Lost Radiants who used tales of monsters to justify their domination of mankind The ardents taught something else They spoke of the Lost Radiantscalled the Knights Radiant thenfighting off Voidbringers during the war to hold Roshar According to these teachings it was only after defeating the Voidbringersand the departure of the Heraldsthat the Radiants had fallen Both groups agreed that the Voidbringers were gone Fabrications or longdefeated enemies the result was the same Shallan could believe that some peoplesome scholars evenmight believe that the Voidbringers still existed haunting mankind But Jasnah the skeptic Jasnah who denied the existence of the Almighty Could the woman really be so twisted as to deny the existence of God but accept the existence of his mythological enemies A knock came at the outer door Shallan jumped raising her hand to her breast She hurriedly replaced the notebooks on the desk in the same order and orientation Then flustered she hurried out to the door Jasnah wouldnt knock you silly fool she told herself unlocking and opening the door a crack Kabsal stood outside The handsome lighteyed ardent held up a basket Ive heard reports that you have the day free He shook the basket temptingly Would you like some jam Shallan calmed herself then glanced back at Jasnahs open quarters She really should investigate more She turned to Kabsal meaning to tell him no but his eyes were so inviting That hint of a smile on his face that goodnatured and relaxed posture If Shallan went with Kabsal maybe she could ask him what he knew regarding Soulcasters That wasnt what decided it for her however The truth was she needed to relax Shed been so on edge lately brain stuffed with philosophy every spare moment spent trying to make the Soulcaster work Was it any wonder she was hearing voices Id love some jam she declared Truthberry jam Kabsal said holding up the small green jar Its Azish Legends there say that those who consume the berries speak only the truth until the next sunset Shallan raised an eyebrow They were seated on cushions atop a blanket in the Conclave gardens not far from where shed first experimented with the Soulcaster And is it true Hardly Kabsal said opening the jar The berries are harmless But the leaves and stalks of the truthberry plant if burned give off a smoke that makes people intoxicated and euphoric It appears that peoples often gathered the stalks for making fires Theyd eat the berries around the campfire and have a ratherinteresting night Its a wonder Shallan began then bit her lip What he prodded She sighed Its a wonder they didnt become known as birthberries considering She blushed He laughed Thats a good point Stormfather she said blushing further Im terrible at being proper Here give me some of that jam He smiled handing over a slice of bread with green jam slathered across the top A dulleyed parshmanappropriated from inside the Conclavesat on the ground beside a shalebark wall acting as an impromptu chaperone It felt so strange to be out with a man near her own age with only a single parshman in attendance It felt liberating Exhilarating Or maybe that was just the sunlight and the open air Im also terrible at being scholarly she said closing her eyes breathing deeply I like it outside far too much Many of the greatest scholars spent their lives traveling And for each one of them Shallan said there were a hundred more stuck back in a hole of a library buried in books And they wouldnt have had it any other way Most people with a bent for research prefer their holes and libraries But you do not That makes you intriguing She opened her eyes smiling at him then took a luscious bite of her jam and bread This Thaylen bread was so fluffy it was more like cake So she said as he chewed on his bite do you feel any more truthful now that youve had the jam I am an ardent he said It is my duty and calling to be truthful at all times Of course she said Im always truthful as well So full of truth in fact that sometimes it squeezes the lies right out my lips There isnt a place for them inside you see He laughed heartily Shallan Davar I cant imagine anyone as sweet as yourself uttering a single untruth Then for the sake of your sanity Ill keep them coming in pairs She smiled Im having a terrible time and this food is awful Youve just disproven an entire body of lore and mythology surrounding the eating of truthberry jam Good Shallan said Jam should not have lore or mythology It should be sweet colorful and delicious Like young ladies I presume Brother Kabsal She blushed again That wasnt at all appropriate And yet you smile I cant help it she said Im sweet colorful and delicious You have the colorful part right he said obviously amused at her deep blush And the sweet part Cant speak for your deliciousness Kabsal she exclaimed though she wasnt entirely shocked Shed once told herself that he was interested in her only in order to protect her soul but that was getting more and more difficult to believe He stopped by at least once a week He chuckled at her embarrassment but that only made her blush further Stop it She held her hand up in front of her eyes My face must be the color of my hair You shouldnt say such things youre a man of religion But still a man Shallan One who said his interest in me was only academic Yes academic he said idly Involving many experiments and much firsthand field research Kabsal He laughed deeply taking a bite of his bread Im sorry Brightness Shallan But it gets such a reaction She grumbled lowering her hand but knew that he said the thingsin partbecause she encouraged him She couldnt help it Nobody had ever shown her the kind of interest that he increasingly did She liked himliked talking with him liked listening to him It was a wonderful way to break the monotony of study There was of course no prospect for a union Assuming she could protect her family shed be needed to make a good political marriage Dallying with an ardent owned by the king of Kharbranth wouldnt serve anyone Ill soon have to start hinting to him the truth she thought He has to know that this wont go anywhere Doesnt he He leaned toward her You really are what you seem arent you Shallan Capable Intelligent Charming He smiled Genuine I wouldnt say that she said You are I see it in you Its not that Im genuine Im naive I lived my entire childhood in my familys manor You dont have the air of a recluse about you Youre so at ease at conversation I had to become so I spent most of my childhood in my own company and I detest boring conversation partners He smiled though his eyes held concern It seems a shame that one such as you would lack for attention Thats like hanging a beautiful painting facing the wall She leaned back on her safehand finishing off her bread I wouldnt say I lacked for attention not quantitatively for certain My father paid me plenty of attention Ive heard of him A stern man by reputation Hes She had to pretend he was still alive My father is a man of passion and virtue Just never at the same time Shallan That might just be the wittiest thing Ive heard you say And perhaps the most truthful Unfortunately Kabsal looked into her eyes searching for something What did he see You dont seem to care for your father much Another truthful statement The berries are working on both of us I see Hes a hurtful man I gather Yes though never to me Im too precious His ideal perfect daughter You see my father is precisely the type of man to hang a picture facing the wrong way That way it cant be soiled by unworthy eyes or touched by unworthy fingers Thats a shame As you look very touchable to me She glared I told you no more of that teasing That wasnt teasing he said regarding her with deep blue eyes Earnest eyes You intrigue me Shallan Davar She found her heart thumping Oddly a panic rose within her at the same time I shouldnt be intriguing Why not Logic puzzles are intriguing Mathematical computations can be intriguing Political maneuvers are intriguing But womenthey should be nothing short of baffling And what if I think Im beginning to understand you Then Im at a severe disadvantage she said As I dont understand myself He smiled We shouldnt be talking like this Kabsal Youre an ardent A man can leave the ardentia Shallan She felt a jolt He looked steadily at her not blinking Handsome softspoken witty This could grow very dangerous very quickly she thought Jasnah thinks youre getting close to me because you want her Soulcaster Shallan blurted out Then she winced Idiot Thats your response when a man hints that he might leave the service of the Almighty in order to be with you Brightness Jasnah is quite clever Kabsal said slicing himself another piece of bread Shallan blinked Oh er You mean shes right Right and wrong Kabsal said The devotary would very very much like to get that fabrial I planned to ask your help eventually But But my superiors thought it was a terrible idea He grimaced They think the king of Alethkar is volatile enough that hed march to war with Kharbranth over that Soulcasters arent Shardblades but they can be equally important He shook his head taking a bite of bread Elhokar Kholin should be ashamed to let his sister use that fabrial particularly so trivially But if we were to steal itWell the repercussions could be felt across all of Vorin Roshar Is that so Shallan said feeling sick He nodded Most people dont think about it I didnt Kings rule and war with Shardsbut their armies subsist through Soulcasters Do you have any idea the kinds of supply lines and support personnel Soulcasters replace Without them warfare is virtually impossible Youd need hundreds of wagons filled with food every month I guessthat would be a problem She took a deep breath They fascinate me these Soulcasters Ive always wondered what it would feel like to use one I as well So youve never used one He shook his head There arent any in Kharbranth Right she thought Of course Thats why the king needed Jasnah to help his granddaughter Have you ever heard anyone talk about using one She cringed at the bold statement Would it make him suspicious He just nodded idly Theres a secret to it Shallan Really she asked heart in her throat He looked up at her seeming conspiratorial Its really not that difficult ItWhat Its true he said Ive heard it from several ardents Theres so much shadow and ritual surrounding Soulcasters Theyre kept mysterious arent used where people can see But the truth is theres not much to them You just put one on press your hand against something and tap a gemstone with your finger It works that simply Thats not how Jasnah does it she said perhaps too defensively Yes that confused me but supposedly if you use one long enough you learn how to control them better He shook his head I dont like the mystery that has grown up around them It smells too much like the mysticism of the old Hierocracy Wed better not find ourselves treading down that path again What would it matter if people knew how simple the Soulcasters are to use The principles and gifts of the Almighty are often simple Shallan barely listened to that last part Unfortunately it seemed that Kabsal was as ignorant as she More ignorant even Shed tried the exact method he spoke of and it didnt work Perhaps the ardents he knew were lying to protect the secret Anyway Kabsal said I guess thats a tangent You asked me about stealing the Soulcaster and rest assured I wouldnt put you in that position I was foolish to think of it and I was shortly forbidden to attempt it I was ordered to care for your soul and see that you werent corrupted by Jasnahs teachings and perhaps try to reclaim Jasnahs soul as well Well that last one is going to be difficult I hadnt noticed he replied dryly She smiled though she couldnt quite decide how to feel I kind of killed the moment didnt I Between us Im glad you did he said dusting off his hands I get carried away Shallan At times I wonder if Im as bad at being an ardent as you are at being proper I dont want to be presumptuous Its just that the way you speak it gets my mind churning and my tongue starts saying whatever comes to it And so And so we should call it a day Kabsal said standing I need time to think Shallan stood as well holding out her freehand for his assistance standing up in a sleek Vorin dress was difficult They were in a section of the gardens where the shalebark wasnt quite so high so once standing Shallan could see that the king himself was passing nearby chatting with a middleaged ardent who had a long narrow face The king often went strolling through the gardens on his midday walk She waved to him but the kindly man didnt see her He was deep in conversation with the ardent Kabsal turned noticed the king then ducked down What Shallan said The king keeps careful track of his ardents He and Brother Ixil think Im on cataloging duty today She found herself smiling Youre scrapping your days work to go on a picnic with me Yes I thought you were supposed to spend time with me she said folding her arms To protect my soul I was But there are those among the ardents who worry that Im a little too interested in you Theyre right Ill come see you tomorrow he said peeking up over the top of the shalebark Assuming Im not stuck in indexing all day as a punishment He smiled at her If I decide to leave the ardentia that is my choice and they can not forbid itthough they may try to distract me He scrambled away as she prepared herself to tell him that he was presuming too much She couldnt get the words out Perhaps because she was growing less and less certain what she wanted Shouldnt she be focused on helping her family By now Jasnah likely had discovered that her Soulcaster didnt work but saw no advantage in revealing it Shallan should leave She could go to Jasnah and use the terrible experience in the alleyway as an excuse to quit And yet she was terribly reluctant Kabsal was part of that but he wasnt the main reason The truth was that despite her occasional complaints she loved learning to be a scholar Even after Jasnahs philosophical training even after spending days reading book after book Even with the confusion and the stress Shallan often felt fulfilled in a way shed never been before Yes Jasnah had been wrong to kill those men but Shallan wanted to know enough about philosophy to cite the correct reasons why Yes digging through historical records could be tedious but Shallan appreciated the skills and patience she was learning they were sure to be of value when she got to do her own deep research in the future Days spent learning lunches spent laughing with Kabsal evenings chatting and debating with Jasnah That was what she wanted And those were the parts of her life that were complete lies Troubled she picked up the basket of bread and jam then made her way back to the Conclave and Jasnahs suite An envelope addressed to her sat in the waiting bin Shallan frowned breaking the seal to look inside Lass it read We got your message The Winds Pleasure will soon be at port in Kharbranth again Of course well give you passage and return to your estates It would be my pleasure to have you aboard We are Davar men we are Indebted to your family Were making a quick trip over to the mainland but will hurry to Kharbranth next Expect us in one weeks time to pick you up Captain Tozbek The undertext written by Tozbeks wife read even more clearly Wed happily give you free passage Brightness if youre willing to do some scribing for us during the trip The ledgers badly need to be rewritten Shallan stared at the note for a long time Shed wanted to know where he was and when he was planning to return but hed apparently taken her letter as a request to come and pick her up It seemed a fitting deadline That would put her departure at three weeks after stealing the Soulcaster as shed told Nan Balat to expect If Jasnah hadnt reacted to the Soulcaster switch by then Shallan would have to take it to mean that she wasnt under suspicion One week She would be on that ship It made her break inside to realize it but it had to be done She lowered the paper and left the guest hallway her steps taking her through the twisting corridors into the Veil Shortly she stood outside Jasnahs alcove The princess sat at her desk reed scratching at a notebook She glanced up I thought I told you that you could do whatever you want today You did Shallan said And I realized that what I want to do is study Jasnah smiled in a sly understanding way Almost a selfsatisfied way If she only knew Well Im not going to chide you for that Jasnah said turning back to her research Shallan sat offering the bread and jam to Jasnah who shook her head and continued researching Shallan cut herself another slice and topped it with jam Then she opened a book and sighed in satisfaction In one week shed have to leave But in the meantime she would let herself pretend a little while longer They lived out in the wilds always awaiting the Desolationor sometimes a foolish child who took no heed of the nights darkness A childs tale yes but this quote from Shadows Remembered seems to hint at the truth I seek See page 82 the fourth tale Kaladin awoke to a familiar feeling of dread Hed spent much of the night lying awake on the hard floor staring up into the dark thinking Why try Why care There is no hope for these men He felt like a wanderer seeking desperately for a pathway into the city to escape wild beasts But the city was atop a steep mountain and no matter how he approached the climb was always the same Impossible A hundred different paths The same result Surviving his punishment would not save his men Training them to run faster would not save them They were bait The efficiency of the bait did not change its purpose or its fate Kaladin forced himself to his feet He felt ground down like a millstone used far too long He still didnt understand how hed survived Did you preserve me Almighty Save me so that I could watch them die You were supposed to burn prayers to send them to the Almighty who waited for his Heralds to recapture the Tranquiline Halls That had never made sense to Kaladin The Almighty was supposed to be able to see all and know all So why did he need a prayer burned before he would do anything Why did he need people to fight for him in the first place Kaladin left the barrack stepping into the light Then he froze The men were lined up waiting A ragged bunch of bridgemen wearing brown leather vests and short trousers that only reached their knees Dirty shirts sleeves rolled to the elbows lacing down the front Dusty skin mops of ragged hair And yet now because of Rocks gift they all had neatly trimmed beards or cleanshaven faces Everything else about them was worn But their faces were clean Kaladin raised a hesitant hand to his face touching his unkempt black beard The men seemed to be waiting for something What he asked The men shifted uncomfortably glancing toward the lumberyard They were waiting for him to lead them in practice of course But practice was futile He opened his mouth to tell them that but hesitated as he saw something approaching Four men carrying a palanquin A tall thin man in a violet lighteyess coat walked beside it The men turned to look Whats this Hobber asked scratching at his thick neck It will be Lamarils replacement Kaladin said gently pushing his way through the line of bridgemen Syl flitted down and landed on his shoulder as the palanquin bearers stopped before Kaladin and turned to the side revealing a darkhaired woman wearing a sleek violet dress decorated with golden glyphs She lounged on her side resting on a cushioned couch her eyes a pale blue I am Brightness Hashal she said voice lightly touched by a Kholinar accent My husband Brightlord Matal is your new captain Kaladin held his tongue biting back a remark He had some experience with lighteyes who got promoted to positions like this one Matal himself said nothing simply standing with his hand resting on the hilt of his sword He was tallnearly as tall as Kaladinbut spindly Delicate hands That sword hadnt seen much practice We have been advised Hashal said that this crew has been troublesome Her eyes narrowed focusing on Kaladin It seems that you have survived the Almightys judgment I bear a message for you from your betters The Almighty has given you another chance to prove yourself as a bridgeman That is all Many are trying to read too much into what happened so Highprince Sadeas has forbidden gawkers to come see you My husband does not intend to run the bridge crews with his predecessors laxness My husband is a wellrespected and honored associate of Highprince Sadeas himself not some neardarkeyed mongrel like Lamaril Is that so Kaladin said Then how did he end up in this latrine pit of a job Hashal didnt display a hint of anger at the comment She flicked her fingers to the side and one of the soldiers stepped forward and rammed the butt of his spear toward Kaladins stomach Kaladin caught it old reflexes still too keen Possibilities flashed through his mind and he could see the fight before it took place Yank on the spear throw the soldier off guard Step forward and ram an elbow into his forearm making him drop the weapon Take control spin the spear up and slam the soldier on the side of the head Spin into a sweep to drop the two who came to help their companion Raise the spear for the No That would only get Kaladin killed Kaladin released the butt of the spear The soldier blinked in surprise that a mere bridgeman had blocked his blow Scowling the soldier jerked the butt up and slammed it into the side of Kaladins head Kaladin let it hit him rolling with it allowing it to toss him to the ground His head rang from the shock but his eyesight stopped spinning after a moment Hed have a headache but probably no concussion He took in a few deep breaths lying on the ground hands forming fists His fingers seemed to burn where he had touched the spear The soldier stepped back into position beside the palanquin No laxness Hashal said calmly If you must know my husband requested this assignment The bridge crews are essential to Brightlord Sadeass advantage in the War of Reckoning Their mismanagement under Lamaril was disgraceful Rock knelt down helping Kaladin to his feet while scowling at the lighteyes and their soldiers Kaladin stumbled up holding his hand to the side of his head His fingers felt slick and wet and a trickle of warm blood ran down his neck to his shoulder From now on Hashal said aside from doing normal bridge duty each crew will be assigned only one type of work duty Gaz The short bridge sergeant poked out from behind the palanquin Kaladin hadnt noticed him there behind the porters and the soldiers Yes Brightness Gaz bowed several times My husband wishes Bridge Four to be assigned chasm duty permanently Whenever they are not needed for bridge duty I want them working in those chasms This will be far more efficient They will know which sections have been scoured recently and will not cover the same ground You see Efficiency They will start immediately She rapped on the side of her palanquin and the porters turned bearing her away Her husband continued to walk alongside her without saying a word and Gaz hurried to keep up Kaladin stared after them holding his hand to his head Dunny ran and fetched him a bandage Chasm duty Moash grumbled Great job lordling Shed see us dead from a chasmfiend if the Parshendi arrows dont take us What are we going to do asked lean balding Peet his voice edged with worry We get to work Kaladin said taking the bandage from Dunny He walked away leaving them in a frightened clump A short time later Kaladin stood at the edge of the chasm looking down The hot light of the noon sun burned the back of his neck and cast his shadow downward into the rift to join with those below I could fly he thought Step off and fall wind blowing against me Fly for a few moments A few beautiful moments He knelt and grabbed the rope ladder then climbed down into the darkness The other bridgemen followed in a silent group Theyd been infected by his mood Kaladin knew what was happening to him Step by step he was turning back into the wretch he had been Hed always known it was a danger Hed clung to the bridgemen as a lifeline But he was letting go now As he stepped down the rungs a faint translucent figure of blue and white dropped beside him sitting on a swinglike seat Its ropes disappeared a few inches above Syls head What is wrong with you she asked softly Kaladin just kept climbing down You should be happy You survived the storms The other bridgemen were so excited I itched to fight that soldier Kaladin whispered Syl cocked her head I could have beaten him Kaladin continued I probably could have beaten all four of them Ive always been good with the spear No not good Durk called me amazing A natural born soldier an artist with the spear Maybe you should have fought them then I thought you didnt like killing I hate it she said growing more translucent But Ive helped men kill before Kaladin froze on the ladder What Its true she said I can remember it just faintly How I dont know She grew paler I dont want to talk about it But it was right to do I feel it Kaladin hung for a moment longer Teft called down asking if something was wrong He started to descend again I didnt fight the soldiers today Kaladin said eyes toward the chasm wall because it wouldnt work My father told me that it is impossible to protect by killing Well he was wrong But He was wrong Kaladin said because he implied that you could protect people in other ways You cant This world wants them dead and trying to save them is pointless He reached the bottom of the chasm stepping into darkness Teft reached the bottom next and lit his torch bathing the mosscovered stone walls in flickering orange light Is that why you didnt accept it Syl whispered flitting over and landing on Kaladins shoulder The glory All those months ago Kaladin shook his head No That was something else What did you say Kaladin Teft raised the torch The aging bridgemans face looked older than usual in the flickering light the shadows it created emphasizing the furrows in his skin Nothing Teft Kaladin said Nothing important Syl sniffed at that Kaladin ignored her lighting his torch from Tefts as the other bridgemen arrived When they were all down Kaladin led the way out into the dark rift The pale sky seemed distant here like a faroff scream This place was a tomb with rotting wood and stagnant pools of water good only for growing cremling larvae The bridgemen clustered together unconsciously as they always did in this fell place Kaladin walked in front and Syl fell silent He gave Teft the chalk to mark directions and didnt pause to pick up salvage But neither did he walk too quickly The other bridgemen were hushed behind them speaking in occasional whispers too low to echo As if their words were strangled by the gloom Rock eventually moved up to walk beside Kaladin Is difficult job we have been given But we are bridgemen Life it is difficult eh Is nothing new We must have plan How do we fight next There is no next fight Rock But we have won grand victory Look not days ago you were delirious You should have died I know this thing But instead you walk strong as any other man Ha Stronger Is miracle The Ulitekanaki guide you Its not a miracle Rock Kaladin said Its more of a curse How is that a curse my friend Rock asked chuckling He jumped up and into a puddle and laughed louder as it splashed Teft who was walking just behind The large Horneater could be remarkably childlike at times Living this thing is no curse It is if it brings me back to watch you all die Kaladin said Better I shouldnt have survived that storm Im just going to end up dead from a Parshendi arrow We all are Rock looked troubled When Kaladin offered nothing more he withdrew They continued uncomfortably passing sections of scarred wall where chasmfiends had left their marks Eventually they stumbled across a heap of bodies deposited by the highstorms Kaladin stopped holding up his torch the other bridgemen peeking around him Some fifty people had been washed into a recess in the rock a small deadend side passage in the stone The bodies were piled there a wall of the dead arms hanging out reeds and flotsam stuck between them Kaladin saw at a glance that the corpses were old enough to begin bloating and rotting Behind him one of the men retched which caused a few of the others to do so as well The scent was terrible the corpses slashed and ripped into by cremlings and larger carrion beasts many of which scuttled away from the light A disembodied hand lay nearby and a trail of blood led away There were also fresh scrapes in the lichen as high as fifteen feet up the wall A chasmfiend had ripped one of the bodies loose to devour It might come back for the others Kaladin didnt retch He shoved his halfburned torch between two large stones then got to work pulling bodies from the pile At least they werent rotted enough to come apart The bridgemen slowly filled in around him working Kaladin let his mind grow numb not thinking Once the bodies were down the bridgemen laid them in a line Then they began pulling off their armor searching their pockets taking knives from belts Kaladin left gathering the spears to the others working by himself off to the side Teft knelt beside Kaladin rolling over a body with a head smashed by the fall The shorter man began to undo the straps on the fallen mans breastplate Do you want to talk Kaladin didnt say anything He just kept working Dont think about the future Dont think about what will happen Just survive Dont care but dont despair Just be Kaladin Tefts voice was like a knife digging into Kaladins shell making him squirm If I wanted to talk Kaladin grumbled would I be working here by myself Fair enough Teft said He finally got the breastplate strap undone The other men are confused son They want to know what were going to do next Kaladin sighed then stood turning to look at the bridgemen I dont know what to do If we try to protect ourselves Sadeas will have us punished Were bait and were going to die Theres nothing I can do about it Its hopeless The bridgemen regarded him with shock Kaladin turned from them and went back to work kneeling beside Teft There he said I explained it to them Idiot Teft said under his breath After all youve done youre abandoning us now To the side the bridgemen turned back to work Kaladin caught a few of them grumbling Bastard Moash said I said this would happen Abandoning you Kaladin hissed to Teft Just let me be Let me go back to apathy At least then theres no pain Teft Ive spent hours and hours trying to find a way out but there isnt one Sadeas wants us dead Lighteyes get what they want thats the way the world works So Kaladin ignored him turning back to his work pulling at the boot on a soldier whose fibula looked to have been shattered in three different places That made it storming awkward to get the boot off Well maybe we will die Teft said But maybe this isnt about surviving Why was Teftof all peopletrying to cheer him up If survival isnt the point Teft then what is Kaladin finally got the boot off He turned to the next body in line then froze It was a bridgeman Kaladin didnt recognize him but that vest and those sandals were unmistakable He lay slumped against the wall arms at his sides mouth slightly open and eyelids sunken The skin on one of the hands had slipped free and pulled away I dont know what the point is Teft grumbled But it seems pathetic to give up We should keep fighting Right until those arrows take us You know journey before destination What does that mean I dont know Teft said looking down quickly Just something I heard once Its something the Lost Radiants used to say Sigzil said walking past Kaladin glanced to the side The softspoken Azish man set a shield on a pile He looked up brown skin dark in the torchlight It was their motto Part of it at least Life before death Strength before weakness Journey before destination Lost Radiants Skar said carrying an armful of boots Whos bringing them up Teft did Moash said I did not That was just something I heard once What does it even mean Dunny asked I said I dont know Teft said It was supposedly one of their creeds Sigzil said In Yulay there are groups of people who talk of the Radiants And wish for their return Whod want them to return Skar said leaning back against the wall folding his arms They betrayed us to the Voidbringers Ha Rock said Voidbringers Lowlander nonsense Is campfire tale told by children They were real Skar said defensively Everyone knows that Everyone who listens to campfire stories Rock said with a laugh Too much air Makes your minds soft Is all right thoughyou are still my family Just the dumb ones Teft scowled as the others continued to talk about the Lost Radiants Journey before destination Syl whispered on Kaladins shoulder I like that Why Kaladin asked kneeling down to untie the dead bridgemans sandals Because she replied as if that were explanation enough Teft is right Kaladin I know you want to give up But you cant Why not Because you cant Were assigned to chasm duty from now on Kaladin said We wont be able to collect any more reeds to make money That means no more bandages antiseptic or food for the nightly meals With all of these bodies were bound to run into rotspren and the men will grow sickassuming chasmfiends dont eat us or a surprise highstorm doesnt drown us And well have to keep running those bridges until Damnation ends losing man after man Its hopeless The men were still talking The Lost Radiants helped the other side Skar argued They were tarnished all along Teft took offense at that The wiry man stood up straight pointing at Skar You dont know anything It was too long ago Nobody knows what really happened Then why do all the stories say the same thing Skar demanded They abandoned us Just like the lighteyes are abandoning us right now Maybe Kaladins right Maybe there is no hope Kaladin looked down Those words haunted him Maybe Kaladin is rightmaybe there is no hope Hed done this before Under his last own er before being sold to Tvlakv and being made a bridgeman Hed given up on a quiet night after leading Goshel and the other slaves in rebellion Theyd been slaughtered But somehow hed survived Storm it all why did he always survive I cant do it again he thought squeezing his eyes shut I cant help them Tien Tukks Goshel Dallet The nameless slave hed tried to heal in Tvlakvs slave wagons All had ended up the same Kaladin had the touch of failure Sometimes he gave them hope but what was hope except another opportunity for failure How many times could a man fall before he no longer stood back up I just think were ignorant Teft grumbled I dont like listening to what the lighteyes say about the past Their women write all the histories you know I cant believe youre arguing about this Teft Skar said exasperated What next Should we let the Voidbringers steal our hearts Maybe theyre just misunderstood Or the Parshendi Maybe we should just let them kill our king whenever they want Would you two just storm off Moash snapped It doesnt matter You heard Kaladin Even he thinks were as good as dead Kaladin couldnt take their voices anymore He stumbled away into the darkness away from the torchlight None of the men followed him He entered a place of dark shadows with only the distant ribbon of sky above for light Here Kaladin escaped their eyes In the darkness he ran into a boulder stumbling to a stop It was slick with moss and lichen He stood with his hands pressed against it then groaned and turned around to lean back against it Syl alighted in front of him still visible despite the darkness She sat down in the air arranging her dress around her legs I cant save them Syl Kaladin whispered anguished Are you certain Ive failed every time before And so youll fail this time too Yes She fell silent Well then she eventually said Lets say that youre right So why fight I told myself that I would try one last time But I failed before I began Theres no saving them Doesnt the fight itself mean anything Not if youre destined to die He hung his head Sigzils words echoed in his head Life before death Strength before weakness Journey before destination Kaladin looked up at the crack of sky Like a faraway river of pure blue water Life before death What did the saying mean That men should seek life before seeking death That was obvious Or did it mean something else That life came before death Again obvious And yet the simple words spoke to him Death comes they whispered Death comes to all But life comes first Cherish it Death is the destination But the journey that is life That is what matters A cold wind blew through the corridor of stone washing over him bringing crisp fresh scents and blowing away the stink of rotting corpses Nobody cared for the bridgemen Nobody cared for those at the bottom with the darkest eyes And yet that wind seemed to whisper to him over and over Life before death Life before death Live before you die His foot hit something He bent down and picked it up A small rock He could barely make it out in the darkness He recognized what was happening to him this melancholy this sense of despair It had taken him often when hed been younger most frequently during the weeks of the Weeping when the sky was hidden by clouds During those times Tien had cheered him up helped him pull out of his despair Tien had always been able to do that Once hed lost his brother hed dealt with these periods of sadness more awkwardly Hed become the wretch not caringbut also not despairing It had seemed better not to feel at all as opposed to feeling pain Im going to fail them Kaladin thought squeezing his eyes shut Why try Wasnt he a fool to keep grasping as he did If only he could win once That would be enough As long as he could believe that he could help someone as long as he believed that some paths led to places other than darkness he could hope You promised yourself you would try one last time he thought They arent dead yet Still alive For now There was one thing he hadnt tried Something hed been too frightened of Every time hed tried it in the past hed lost everything The wretch seemed to be standing before him He meant release Apathy Did Kaladin really want to go back to that It was a false refuge Being that man hadnt protected him It had only led him deeper and deeper until taking his own life had seemed the better way Life before death Kaladin stood up opening his eyes dropping the small rock He walked slowly back toward the torchlight The bridgemen looked up from their work So many questioning eyes Some doubtful some grim others encouraging Rock Dunny Hobber Leyten They believed in him He had survived the storms One miracle granted There is something we could try Kaladin said But it will most likely end with us all dead at the hands of our own army Were bound to end up dead anyway Maps noted You said so yourself Several of the others nodded Kaladin took a deep breath We have to try to escape But the warcamp is guarded said Earless Jaks Bridgemen arent allowed out without supervision They know wed run Wed die Moash said face grim Were miles and miles from civilization Theres nothing out here but greatshells and no shelter from highstorms I know Kaladin said But its either this or the Parshendi arrows The men fell silent Theyre going to send us down here every day to rob corpses Kaladin said And they dont send us with supervision since they fear the chasmfiends Most bridgeman work is busywork to distract us from our fate so we only have to bring back a small amount of salvage You think we should choose one of these chasms and flee down it Skar asked Theyve tried to map them all The crews never reached the other side of the Plainsthey got killed by chasmfiends or highstorm floods Kaladin shook his head Thats not what were going to do He kicked at something on the ground before hima fallen spear His kick sent it into the air toward Moash who caught it surprised I can train you to use those Kaladin said softly The men fell silent looking at the weapon What good would this thing do Rock asked taking the spear from Moash looking it over We can not fight an army No Kaladin said But if I train you then we can attack a guard post at night We might be able to get away Kaladin looked at them meeting each mans eyes in turn Once were free theyll send soldiers after us Sadeas wont let bridgemen kill his soldiers and get away with it Well have to hope he underestimates us and sends a small group at first If we kill them we might be able to get far enough away to hide It will be dangerous Sadeas will go to great lengths to recapture us and well likely end with an entire company chasing us down Storm it well probably never escape the camp in the first place But its something He fell silent waiting as the men exchanged uncertain glances Ill do it Teft said straightening up Me too Moash said stepping forward He seemed eager And I Sigzil said I would rather spit in their Alethi faces and die on their swords than remain a slave Ha Rock said And I shall cook you all much food to keep you full while you kill You wont fight with us Dunny asked surprised Is beneath me Rock said raising his chin Well Ill do it Dunny said Im your man Captain Others began to chime in each man standing several grabbing spears from the wet ground They didnt yell in excitement or roar like other troops Kaladin had led They were frightened by the idea of fightingmost had been common slaves or lowly workmen But they were willing Kaladin stepped forward and began to outline a plan FIVE YEARS AGO Kaladin hated the Weeping It marked the end of an old year and the coming of a new one four solid weeks of rain in a ceaseless cascade of sullen drops Never furious never passionate like a highstorm Slow steady Like the blood of a dying year that was taking its last few shambling steps toward the cairn While other seasons of weather came and went unpredictably the Weeping never failed to return at the same time each year Unfortunately Kaladin lay on the sloped roof of his house in Hearthstone A small pail of pitch sat next to him covered by a piece of wood It was almost empty now that hed finished patching the roof The Weeping was a miserable time to do this work but it was also when a persistent leak could be most irritating Theyd repatch when the Weeping ended but at least this way they wouldnt have to suffer a steady stream of drips onto their dining table for the next weeks He lay on his back staring up at the sky Perhaps he should have climbed down and gone inside but he was already soaked through So he stayed Watching thinking Another army was passing through the town One of many these daysthey often came during the Weeping resupplying and moving to new battlefields Roshone had made a rare appearance to welcome the warlord Highmarshal Amaram himself apparently a distant cousin as well as head of Alethi defense in this area He was of the most renowned soldiers still in Alethkar most had left for the Shattered Plains The small raindrops misted Kaladin Many of the others liked these weeksthere were no highstorms save for one right in the middle To the townspeople it was a cherished time to rest from farming and relax But Kaladin longed for the sun and the wind He actually missed the highstorms with their rage and vitality These days were dreary and he found it difficult to get anything productive done As if the lack of storms left him without strength Few people had seen much of Roshone since the illfated whitespine hunt and the death of his son He hid in his mansion increasingly reclusive The people of Hearthstone trod very lightly as if they expected that any moment he could explode and turn his rage against them Kaladin wasnt worried about that A stormwhether from a person or the skywas something you could react to But this suffocation this slow and steady dousing of lifeThat was far far worse Kaladin Tiens voice called Are you still up there Yeah he called back not moving The clouds were so bland during the Weeping Could anything be more lifeless than that miserable grey Tien rounded to the back of the building where the roof sloped down to touch the ground He had his hands in the pockets of his long raincoat a widebrimmed hat on his head Both looked too large for him but clothing always seemed too large for Tien Even when it fit him properly Kaladins brother climbed up onto the roof and walked up beside him then lay down staring upward Someone else might have tried to cheer Kaladin up and they would have failed But somehow Tien knew the right thing to do For the moment that was keeping silent You like the rain dont you Kaladin finally asked him Yeah Tien said Of course Tien liked pretty much everything Hard to stare up at like this though I keep blinking For some reason that made Kaladin smile I made you something Tien said At the shop today Kaladins parents were worried Ral the carpenter had taken Tien though he didnt really need another apprentice and was reportedly dissatisfied with the boys work Tien got distracted easily Ral complained Kaladin sat up as Tien fished something out of his pocket It was a small wooden horse intricately carved Dont worry about the water Tien said handing it over I sealed it already Tien Kaladin said amazed This is beautiful The details were amazingthe eyes the hooves the lines in the tail It looked just like the majestic animals that pulled Roshones carriage Did you show this to Ral He said it was good Tien said smiling beneath his oversized hat But he told me I should have been making a chair instead I kind of got into trouble But howI mean Tien hes got to see this is amazing Oh I dont know about that Tien said still smiling Its just a horse Master Ral likes things you can use Things to sit on things to put clothes in But I think I can make a good chair tomorrow something that will make him proud Kaladin looked at his brother with his innocent face and affable nature He hadnt lost either though he was now into his teenage years How is it you can always smile Kaladin thought Its dreadful outside your master treats you like crem and your family is slowly being strangled by the citylord And yet you smile How Tien And why is it that you make me want to smile too Father spent another of the spheres Tien Kaladin found himself saying Each time their father was forced to do that he seemed to grow a little more wan stand a little less tall Those spheres were dun these days no light in them You couldnt infuse spheres during the Weeping They all ran out eventually There are plenty more Tien said Roshone is trying to wear us down Kaladin said Bit by bit smother us Its not as bad as it seems Kaladin his brother said reaching up to hold his arm Things are never as bad as they seem Youll see So many objections rose in his mind but Tiens smile banished them There in the midst of the dreariest part of the year Kaladin felt for a moment as if he had glimpsed sunshine He could swear he felt things grow brighter around them the storm retreating a shade the sky lightening Their mother rounded the back of the building She looked up at them as if amused to find them both sitting on the roof in the rain She stepped onto the lower portion A small group of haspers clung to the stone there the small twoshelled creatures proliferated during the Weeping They seemed to grow out of nowhere much like their cousins the tiny snails scattered all across the stone What are you two talking about she asked walking up and sitting down with them Hesina rarely acted like the other mothers in town Sometimes that bothered Kaladin Shouldnt she have sent them into the house or something complaining that theyd catch a cold No she just sat down with them wearing a brown leather raincoat Kaladins worried about Father spending the spheres Tien said Oh I wouldnt worry about that she replied Well get you to Kharbranth Youll be old enough to leave in two more months You two should come with me Kal said And Father too And leave the town Tien said as if hed never considered that possibility But I like it here Hesina smiled What Kaladin said Most young men your age are trying everything they can to be rid of their parents I cant go off and leave you here Were a family Hes trying to strangle us Kaladin said glancing at Tien Talking with his brother had made him feel a lot better but his objections were still there Nobody pays for healing and I know nobody will pay you for work anymore What kind of value does Father get for those spheres he spends anyway Vegetables at ten times the regular price moldy grain at double Hesina smiled Observant Father taught me to notice details The eyes of a surgeon Well she said eyes twinkling did your surgeons eyes notice the first time we spent one of the spheres Sure Kaladin said It was the day after the hunting accident Father had to buy new cloth to make bandages And did we need new bandages Well no But you know how Father is He doesnt like it when we start to run even a little low And so he spent one of those spheres Hesina said That hed hoarded for months and months butting heads with the citylord over them Not to mention going to such lengths to steal them in the first place Kaladin thought But you know all about that He glanced at Tien who was watching the sky again So far as Kal knew his brother hadnt discovered the truth yet So your father resisted so long Hesina said only to finally break and spend a sphere on some cloth bandages we wouldnt need for months She had a point Why had his father suddenly decided toHes letting Roshone think hes winning Kaladin said with surprise looking back at her Hesina smiled slyly Roshone would have found a way to get retribution eventually It wouldnt have been easy Your father ranks high as a citizen and has the right of inquest He did save Roshones life and many could testify to the severity of Rillirs wounds But Roshone would have found a way Unless he felt hed broken us Kaladin turned toward the mansion Though it was hidden by the shroud of rain he could just make out the tents of the army camped on the field below What would it be like to live as a soldier often exposed to storms and rain to winds and tempests Once Kaladin would have been intrigued but the life of a spearman had no call for him now His mind was filled with diagrams of muscles and memorized lists of symptoms and diseases Well keep spending the spheres Hesina said One every few weeks Partially to live though my family has offered supplies More to keep Roshone thinking that were bending And then we send you away Unexpectedly Youll be gone the spheres safely in the hands of the ardents to use as a stipend during your years of study Kaladin blinked in realization They werent losing They were winning Think of it Kaladin Tien said Youll live in one of the grandest cities in the world It will be so exciting Youll be a man of learning like Father Youll have clerks to read to you from any book you want Kaladin pushed wet hair off his forehead Tien made it sound a lot grander than hed been thinking Of course Tien could make a cremfilled puddle sound grand Thats true his mother said still staring upward You could learn mathematics history politics tactics the sciences Arent those things women learn Kaladin said frowning Lighteyed women study them But there are male scholars as well If not as many All this to become a surgeon You wouldnt have to become a surgeon Your life is your own son If you take the path of a surgeon we will be proud But dont feel that you need to live your fathers life for him She looked down at Kaladin blinking rainwater from her eyes What else would I do Kaladin said stupefied There are many professions open to men with a good mind and training If you really wished to study all the arts you could become an ardent Or perhaps a stormwarden Stormwarden He reached by reflex for the prayer sewn to his left sleeve waiting for the day hed need to burn it for aid They seek to predict the future Its not the same thing Youll see There are so many things to explore so many places your mind could go The world is changing My familys most recent letter describes amazing fabrials like pens that can write across great distances It might not be long before men are taught to read Id never want to learn something like that Kaladin said aghast glancing at Tien Was their own mother really saying these things But then shed always been like this Free both with her mind and her tongue Yet to become a stormwardenThey studied the highstorms predicted themyesbut learned about them and their mysteries They studied the winds themselves No Kaladin said I want to be a surgeon Like my father Hesina smiled If thats what you choose thenas I saidwe will be proud of you But father and I just want you to know that you can choose They sat like that for some time letting rainwater soak them Kaladin kept searching those grey clouds wondering what it was that Tien found so interesting in them Eventually he heard splashing below and Lirins face appeared at the side of the house What in the he said All three of you What are you doing up here Feasting Kaladins mother said nonchalantly On what On irregularity dear she said Lirin sighed Dear you can be very odd you know And didnt I just say that Point Well come on Theres a gathering in the square Hesina frowned She rose and walked down the slope of the roof Kaladin glanced at Tien and the two of them stood Kaladin stuffed the wooden horse in his pocket and picked his way down careful on the slick rock his shoes squishing Cool water ran down Kaladins cheeks as he stepped off onto the ground They followed Lirin toward the square Kaladins father looked worried and he walked with the beatendown slouch he was prone to lately Maybe it was an affectation to fool Roshone but Kaladin suspected there was some truth to it His father didnt like having to give up those spheres even if it was part of a ruse It was too much like giving in Ahead a crowd was gathering at the town square everyone holding umbrellas or wearing cloaks What is it Lirin Hesina asked sounding anxious Roshone is going to put in an appearance Lirin said He asked Waber to gather everyone Full town meeting In the rain Kaladin asked Couldnt he have waited for Lightday Lirin didnt reply The family walked in silence even Tien growing solemn They passed some rainspren standing in puddles glowing with a faint blue light shaped like anklehigh melting candles with no flame They rarely appeared except during the Weeping They were said to be the souls of raindrops glowing blue rods seeming to melt but never growing smaller a single blue eye at their tops The townspeople were mostly assembled gossiping in the rain by the time Kaladins family arrived Jost and Naget were there though neither waved to Kaladin it had been years since theyd been anything resembling friends Kaladin shivered His parents called this town home and his father refused to leave but it felt less and less like home by the day Ill be leaving it soon he thought eager to walk out of Hearthstone and leave these smallminded people behind To go to a place where lighteyes were men and women of honor and beauty worthy of the high station given them by the Almighty Roshones carriage approached It had lost much of its luster during his years in Hearthstone the golden paint flaking off the dark wood chipped by road gravel As the carriage pulled into the square Waber and his boys finally got a small canopy erected The rain had strengthened and drops hit the cloth with a hollow drumming sound The air smelled different with all of these people around Up on the roof it had been fresh and clean Now it seemed muggy and humid The carriage door opened Roshone had gained more weight and his lighteyess suit had been retailored to fit his increased girth He wore a wooden peg on his right stump hidden by the cuff of his trouser and his gait was stiff as he climbed out of the carriage and ducked beneath the canopy grumbling He hardly seemed the same person with that beard and wet stringy hair But his eyes they were the same More beady now because of the fuller cheeks but still seething as he studied the crowd As if he had been hit with a rock when he wasnt looking and now searched for the culprit Was Laral inside the carriage Someone else moved inside climbing out but it turned out to be a lean man with a cleanshaven face and light tan eyes The dignified man wore a neatly pressed green formal military uniform and had a sword at his hip Highmarshal Amaram He certainly looked impressive with that strong figure and square face The difference between him and Roshone was striking Finally Laral did appear wearing a light yellow dress of an antique fashion with a flaring skirt and thick bodice She glanced up at the rain then waited for a footman to hurry over with an umbrella Kaladin felt his heart thumping They hadnt spoken since the day shed humiliated him in Roshones mansion And yet she was gorgeous As she had grown through her adolescence she had gotten prettier and prettier Some might find that dark hair sprinkled with foreigner blond to be unappealing for its indication of mixed blood but to Kaladin it was alluring Beside Kaladin his father stiffened cursing softly What Tien asked from beside Kaladin craning to see Laral Kaladins mother said Shes wearing a brides prayer on her sleeve Kaladin started seeing the white cloth with its blue glyphpair sewn onto the sleeve of her dress Shed burn it when the engagement was formally announced Butwho Rillir was dead Id heard rumors of this Kaladins father said It appears Roshone wasnt willing to part with the connections she offers Him Kaladin asked stunned Roshone himself was marrying her Others in the crowd had begun speaking as they noticed the prayer Lighteyes marry much younger women all the time Kaladins mother said For them marriages are often about securing house loyalty Him Kaladin asked again incredulous stepping forward We have to stop it We have to Kaladin his father said sharply But It is their affair not ours Kaladin fell silent feeling the larger raindrops hit his head the smaller ones blowing by as mist The water ran through the square and pooled in depressions Near Kaladin a rainspren sprang up forming as if out of the water It stared upward unblinking Roshone leaned on his cane and nodded to Natir his steward The man was accompanied by his wife a sternlooking woman named Alaxia Natir clapped his slender hands to quiet the crowd and soon the only sound was that of the soft rain Brightlord Amaram Roshone said nodding to the lighteyed man in the uniform is absendiar highmarshal of our princedom He is in command of defending our borders while the king and Brightlord Sadeas are away Kaladin nodded Everyone knew of Amaram He was far more important than most military men who passed through Hearthstone Amaram stepped forward to speak You have a fine town here Amaram said to the gathered darkeyes He had a strong deep voice Thank you for hosting me Kaladin frowned glancing at the other townspeople They seemed as confused as he by the statement Normally Amaram said I would leave this task to one of my subordinate officers But as I was visiting with my cousin I decided to come down in person It is not so onerous a task that I need delegate it Excuse me Brightlord said Callins one of the farmers But what duty is that Why recruitment good farmer Amaram said nodding to Alaxia who stepped forward with a sheet of paper strapped to a board The king took most of our armies with him on his quest to fulfill the Vengeance Pact My forces are undermanned and it has become necessary to recruit young men from each town or village we pass I do this with volunteers whenever possible The townspeople fell still Boys talked of running off to the army but few of them would actually do it Hearthstones duty was to provide food My fighting is not as glorious as the war for vengeance Amaram said but it is our sacred duty to defend our lands This tour will be for four years and upon completing your duty you will receive a war bonus equal to onetenth your total wages You may then return or you may sign up for further duty Distinguish yourself and rise to a high rank and it could mean an increase of one nahn for you and your children Are there any volunteers Ill go Jost said stepping forward Me too Abry added Jost Josts mother said grabbing his arm The crops Your crops are important darkwoman Amaram said but not nearly as important as the defense of our people The king sends back riches from the plundered Plains and the gemstones he has captured can provide food for Alethkar in emergency You two are both welcome Are there any others Three more boys from the town stepped forward and one older manHarl who had lost his wife to the scarfever He was the man whose daughter Kaladin hadnt been able to save after her fall Excellent Amaram said Are there any others The townspeople were still Oddly so Many of the boys Kaladin had heard talk so often about joining the army looked away Kaladin felt his heart beating and his leg twitched as if itching to propel him forward No He was to be a surgeon Lirin looked at him and his dark brown eyes displayed hints of deep concern But when Kaladin didnt make any moves forward he relaxed Very well Amaram said nodding to Roshone We will need your list after all List Lirin asked loudly Amaram glanced at him The need of our army is great darkborn I will take volunteers first but the army must be replenished As citylord my cousin has the duty and honor of deciding which men to send Read the first four names Alaxia Roshone said and the last one Alaxia looked down at her list speaking with a dry voice Agil son of Marf Caull son of Taleb Kaladin looked up at Lirin with apprehension He cant take you Lirin said Were of the second nahn and provide an essential function to the townI as surgeon you as my only apprentice By the law we are exempt from conscription Roshone knows it Habrin son of Arafik Alaxia continued Jorna son of Loats She hesitated then looked up Tien son of Lirin There was a stillness across the square Even the rain seemed to hesitate for a moment Then all eyes turned toward Tien The boy looked dumbfounded Lirin was immune as town surgeon Kaladin immune as his apprentice But not Tien He was a carpenters third apprentice not vital not immune Hesina gripped Tien tightly No Lirin stepped in front of them defensive Kaladin stood stunned looking at Roshone Smiling selfsatisfied Roshone We took his son Kaladin realized meeting those beady eyes This is his revenge I Tien said The military For once he seemed to lose his confidence his optimism His eyes opened wide and he grew very pale He fainted when he saw blood He hated fighting He was still small and spindly despite his age Hes too young Lirin declared Their neighbors sidled away leaving Lirins family to stand alone in the rain Amaram frowned In the cities youths as young as eight and nine are accepted into the military Lighteyed sons Lirin said To be trained as officers They arent sent into battle Amaram frowned more deeply He stepped out into the rain walking up to the family How old are you son he asked Tien Hes thirteen Lirin said Amaram glanced at him The surgeon Ive heard of you He sighed glancing back at Amaram I havent the time to engage in your petty smalltown politics cousin Isnt there another boy that will do It is my choice Roshone insisted Given me by the dictates of law I send those the town can sparewell that boy is the first one we can spare Lirin stepped forward eyes full of anger Highmarshal Amaram caught him by the arm Do not do something you would regret darkborn Roshone has acted according to the law You hid behind the law sneering at me surgeon Roshone called to Lirin Well now it turns against you Keep those spheres The look on your face at this moment is worth the price of every one of them I Tien said again Kaladin had never seen the boy so terrified Kaladin felt powerless The crowds eyes were on Lirin standing with his arm in the grip of the lighteyed general locking his gaze with Roshone Ill make the lad a runner boy for a year or two Amaram promised He wont be in combat It is the best I can do Every body is needed in these times Lirin slumped then bowed his head Roshone laughed motioning Laral toward the carriage She didnt glance at Kaladin as she climbed back in Roshone followed and though he was still laughing his expression had grown hard Lifeless Like the dull clouds above He had his revenge but his son was still dead and he was still stuck in Hearthstone Amaram regarded the crowd The recruits may bring two changes of clothing and up to three stoneweights of other possessions They will be weighed Report to the army in two hours and ask for Sergeant Hav He turned and followed Roshone Tien stared after him pale as a whitewashed building Kaladin could see his terror at leaving his family His brother the one who always made him smile when it rained It was physically painful for Kaladin to see him so scared It wasnt right Tien should smile That was who he was He felt the wooden horse in his pocket Tien always brought him relief when he felt pained Suddenly it occurred to him that there was something he could do in turn Its time to stop hiding in the room when someone else holds up the globe of light Kaladin thought Its time to be a man Brightlord Amaram Kaladin yelled The general hesitated standing on the stepstool into the carriage one foot in the door He glanced over his shoulder I want to take Tiens place Kaladin said Not allowed Roshone said from inside the carriage The law says I may choose Amaram nodded grimly Then what if you take me as well Kaladin said Can I volunteer That way at least Tien wouldnt be alone Kaladin Hesina said grabbing him on one arm It is allowed Amaram said I will not turn away any soldier son If you want to join you are welcome Kaladin no Lirin said Dont both of you go Dont Kaladin looked at Tien the boys face wet beneath his widebrimmed hat He shook his head but his eyes seemed hopeful I volunteer Kaladin said turning back to Amaram Ill go Then you have two hours Amaram said climbing into the carriage Same possession allotment as the others The carriage door shut but not before Kaladin got a glimpse of an even more satisfied Roshone Rattling the vehicle splashed away dropping a sheet of water from its roof Why Lirin said turning back to Kaladin his voice ragged Why have you done this to me After all of our plans Kaladin turned to Tien The boy took his arm Thank you Tien whispered Thank you Kaladin Thank you Ive lost both of you Lirin said hoarsely splashing away Storm it Both of you He was crying Kaladins mother was crying too She clutched Tien again Father Kaladin said turning amazed at how confident he felt Lirin paused standing in the rain one foot in a puddle where rainspren clustered They inched away from him like vertical slugs In four years I will bring him home safely Kaladin said I promise it by the storms and the Almightys tenth name itself I will bring him back I promise Yelignar called Blightwind was one that could speak like a man though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed The Unmade were obviously fabrications of folklore Curiously most were not considered individuals but instead personifications of kinds of destruction This quote is from Traxil line 33 considered a primary source though I doubt its authenticity They are an oddly welcoming group these wild parshmen Shallan read It was King Gavilars account again recorded a year before his murder It has now been nearly five months since our first meeting Dalinar continues to pressure me to return to our homeland insisting that the expedition has stretched too long The parshmen promise that they will lead me on a hunt for a greatshelled beast they call an ulo mas vara which my scholars say translates roughly to Monster of the Chasms If their descriptions are accurate these creatures have large gemhearts and one of their heads would make a truly impressive trophy They also speak of their terrible gods and we think they must be referring to several particularly large chasm greatshells We are amazed to find religion among these parshmen The mounting evidence of a complete parshman societywith civilization culture and a unique languageis astounding My stormwardens have begun calling this people the Parshendi It is obvious this group is very different from our ordinary servant parshmen and may not even be the same race despite the skin patterns Perhaps they are distant cousins as different from ordinary parshmen as Alethi axehounds are from the Selay breed The Parshendi have seen our servants and are confused by them Where is their music Klade will often ask me I do not know what he means But our servants do not react to the Parshendi at all showing no interest in emulating them This is reassuring The question about music may have to do with the humming and chanting the Parshendi often do They have an uncanny ability to make music together I swear that I have left one Parshendi singing to himself then soon passed another out of earshot of the first yet singing the very same songeerily near to the other in tempo tune and lyric Their favored instrument is the drum They are crudely made with handprints of paint marking the sides This matches their simple buildings which they construct of crem and stone They build them in the craterlike rock formations here at the edge of the Shattered Plains I ask Klade if they worry about highstorms but he just laughs Why worry If the buildings blow down we can build them again can we not On the other side of the alcove Jasnahs book rustled as she turned a page Shallan set aside her own volume then picked through the books on the desk Her philosophy training done for the time being she had returned to her study of King Gavilars murder She slid a small volume out from the bottom of the stack a record dictated by Stormwarden Matain one of the scholars who had accompanied the king Shallan flipped through the pages searching for a specific passage It was a description of the very first Parshendi hunting party they encountered It happened after we set up beside a deep river in a heavily wooded area It was an ideal location for a longterm camp as the dense cobwood trees would protect against highstorm winds and the rivers gorge eliminated the risk of flooding His Majesty wisely took my advice sending scouting parties both upriver and down Highprince Dalinars scouting party was the first to encounter the strange untamed parshmen When he returned to camp with his story Ilike many othersrefused to believe his claims Surely Brightlord Dalinar had simply run across the parshman servants of another expedition like our own Once they visited our camp the next day their reality could no longer be denied There were ten of themparshmen to be sure but bigger than the familiar ones Some had skin marbled black and red and others were marbled white and red as is more common in Alethkar They carried magnificent weapons the bright steel etched with complex decorations but wore simple clothing of woven narbin cloth Before long His Majesty became fascinated by these strange parshmen insisting that I begin a study of their language and society Ill admit that my original intent was to expose them as a hoax of some kind The more we learned however the more I came to realize how faulty my original assessment had been Shallan tapped the page thinking Then she pulled out a thick volume titled King Gavilar Kholin a Biography published by Gavilars widow Navani two years before Shallan flipped through pages scanning for a particular paragraph My husband was an excellent kingan inspiring leader an unparalleled duelist and a genius of battlefield tactics But he didnt have a single scholarly finger on his left hand He never showed an interest in the accounting of highstorms was bored by talk of science and ignored fabrials unless they had an obvious use in battle He was a man built after the classical masculine ideal Why was he so interested in them Shallan said out loud Hmmm Jasnah asked King Gavilar Shallan said Your mother insists in her biography that he wasnt a scholar True But he was interested in the Parshendi Shallan said Even before he could have known about their Shardblades According to Matains account he wanted to know about their language their society and their music Was that just embellishment to make him sound more scholarly to future readers No Jasnah said lowering her own book The longer he remained in the Unclaimed Hills the more fascinated by the Parshendi he became So theres a discrepancy Why would a man with no prior interest in scholarship suddenly become so obsessed Yes Jasnah said I too have wondered about this But sometimes people change When he returned I was encouraged by his interest we spent many evenings talking about his discoveries It was one of the few times when I felt I really connected with my father Shallan bit her lip Jasnah she finally asked Why did you assign me to research this event You lived through this you already know everything Im discovering I feel a fresh perspective may be of value Jasnah put down her book looking over at Shallan I dont intend for you to find specific answers Instead I hope that you will notice details Ive missed You are coming to see how my fathers personality changed during those months and that means you are digging deeply Believe it or not few others have caught the discrepancy you just didthough many do note his later changes once he returned to Kholinar Even so I feel a little odd studying it Perhaps Im still influenced by my tutors idea that only the classics are a proper realm of study for young ladies The classics do have their place and I will send you to classical works on occasion as I did with your study of morality But I intend such tangents to be adjuncts to your current projects Those must be the focus not longlost historical conundrums Shallan nodded But Jasnah arent you a historian Arent those longlost historical conundrums the meat of your field Im a Veristitalian Jasnah said We search for answers in the past reconstructing what truly happened To many writing a history is not about truth but about presenting the most flattering picture of themselves and their motives My sisters and I choose projects that we feel were misunderstood or misrepresented and in studying them hope to better understand the present Why then are you spending so much time studying folktales and looking for evil spirits No Jasnah was searching for something real Something so important that it drew her away from the Shattered Plains and the fight to avenge her father She intended to do something with those folktales and Shallans research was part of it somehow That excited her It was the sort of thing shed wanted since shed been a child looking through her fathers few books frustrated that hed chased off yet another tutor Here with Jasnah Shallan was part of somethingand knowing Jasnah it was something big And yet she thought Tozbeks ship arrives tomorrow morning Ill be leaving I need to start complaining I need to convince Jasnah that this was all so much harder than I anticipated so that when I leave she wont be surprised I need to cry break down give up I need to What is Urithiru Shallan found herself asking instead To her surprise Jasnah answered without hesitation Urithiru was said to be the center of the Silver Kingdoms a city that held ten thrones one for each king It was the most majestic most amazing most important city in all the world Really Why hadnt I heard of it before Because it was abandoned even before the Lost Radiants turned against mankind Most scholars consider it just a myth The ardents refuse to speak of it due to its association with the Radiants and therefore with the first major failure of Vorinism Much of what we know about the city comes from fragments of lost works quoted by classical scholars Many of those classical works have themselves survived only in pieces Indeed the single complete work we have from early years is The Way of Kings and that is only because of the Vanrials efforts Shallan nodded slowly If there were ruins of a magnificent ancient city hidden somewhere Natanatanunexplored overgrown wildwould be the natural place to find them Urithiru is not in Natanatan Jasnah said smiling But it is a good guess Shallan Return to your studies The weapons Shallan said Jasnah raised an eyebrow The Parshendi They carried beautiful weapons of fine etched steel Yet they used skin drums with crude handprints on the sides and lived in huts of stone and crem Doesnt that strike you as incongruous Yes I would certainly describe that as an oddity Then I assure you Shallan Jasnah said The city is not there But you are interested in the Shattered Plains You spoke of them with Brightlord Dalinar through the spanreed I did What were the Voidbringers Now that Jasnah was actually answering perhaps shed say What were they really Jasnah studied her with a curious expression Nobody knows for sure Most scholars consider them like Urithiru mere myths while theologians accept them as counterparts of the Almightymonsters that dwelled in the hearts of men much as the Almighty once lived there But Return to your studies child Jasnah said raising her book Perhaps we will speak of this another time There was an air of finality about that Shallan bit her lip keeping herself from saying something rude just to draw Jasnah back into conversation She doesnt trust me she thought Perhaps with good reason Youre leaving Shallan told herself again Tomorrow Youre sailing away from this But that meant she had only one day left One more day in the grand Palanaeum One more day with all of these books all of this power and knowledge I need a copy of Tifandors biography of your father Shallan said poking through the books I keep seeing it referenced Its on one of the bottom floors Jasnah said idly I might be able to dig out the index number No need Shallan said standing Ill look it up I need the practice As you wish Jasnah said Shallan smiled She knew exactly where the book wasbut the pretense of searching for it would give her time away from Jasnah And during that time shed see what she could discover about the Voidbringers on her own Two hours later Shallan sat at a cluttered desk at the back of one of the Palanaeums lowerlevel rooms her sphere lantern illuminating a stack of hastily gathered volumes none of which had proven much use It seemed that everybody knew something about the Voidbringers People in rural areas spoke of them as mysterious creatures that came out at night stealing from the unlucky and punishing the foolish Those Voidbringers seemed more mischievous than evil But then there would be the odd story about a Voidbringer taking on the form of a wayward traveler whoafter receiving kindness from a tallew farmerwould slaughter the entire family drink their blood then write voidish symbols across the walls in black ash Most people in the cities however saw the Voidbringers as spirits who stalked at night a kind of evil spren that invaded the hearts of men and made them do terrible things When a good man grew angry it was the work of a Voidbringer Scholars laughed at all these ideas Actual historical accountsthe ones she could find quicklywere contradictory Were the Voidbringers the denizens of Damnation If so wouldnt Damnation now be empty as the Voidbringers had conquered the Tranquiline Halls and cast out mankind to Roshar I should have known that Id have trouble finding anything solid Shallan thought leaning back in her chair Jasnahs been researching this for months maybe years What did I expect to find in a few hours The only thing the research had done was increase her confusion What errant winds had brought Jasnah to this topic It made no sense Studying the Voidbringers was like trying to determine if deathspren were real or not What was the point She shook her head stacking her books The ardents would reshelve them for her She needed to fetch Tifandors biography and return to their balcony She rose and walked toward the rooms exit carrying her lantern in her freehand She hadnt brought a parshman she intended to carry back only the one book As she reached the exit she noticed another light approaching out on the balcony Just before she arrived someone stepped up to the doorway holding aloft a garnet lantern Kabsal Shallan asked surprised to see his youthful face painted blue by the light Shallan he asked looking up at the index inscription atop the entryway What are you doing here Jasnah said you were looking for Tifandor Igot turned around He raised an eyebrow at her Bad lie she asked Terrible he said Youre two floors up and about a thousand index numbers off After I couldnt find you below I asked the lift porters to take me where they brought you and they took me here Jasnahs training can be exhausting Shallan said So I sometimes find a quiet corner to relax and compose myself Its the only time I get to be alone Kabsal nodded thoughtfully Better she asked Still problematic You took a break but for two hours Besides I remember you telling me that Jasnahs training wasnt so terrible Shed believe me Shallan said She thinks shes far more demanding than she is Orwell she is demanding I just dont mind as much as she thinks I do Very well he said But what were you doing down here then She bit her lip causing him to laugh What she demanded blushing You just look so blasted innocent when you do that I am innocent Didnt you just lie to me twice in a row Innocent as in the opposite of sophisticated She grimaced Otherwise theyd have been more convincing lies Come Walk with me while I fetch Tifandor If we hurry I wont have to lie to Jasnah Fair enough he said joining her and strolling around the perimeter of the Palanaeum The hollow inverted pyramid rose toward the ceiling far above the four walls expanding outward at a slant The topmost levels were brighter and easier to make out tiny lights bobbing along railings in the hands of ardents or scholars Fiftyseven levels Shallan said I cant even imagine how much work it must have been for you to create all this We didnt create it Kabsal said It was here The main shaft at least The Kharbranthians cut out the rooms for the books This formation is natural As natural as cities like Kholinar Or have you forgotten my demonstration No But why didnt you use this place as one of your examples We havent found the right sand pattern yet he said But were sure the Almighty himself made this place as he did the cities What about the Dawnsingers Shallan asked What about them Could they have created it He chuckled as they arrived at the lift That isnt the kind of thing the Dawnsingers did They were healers kindly spren sent by the Almighty to care for humans once we were forced out of the Tranquiline Halls Kind of like the opposite of the Voidbringers I suppose you could say that Take us down two levels she told the parshman lift porters They began lowering the platform the pulleys squeaking and wood shaking beneath her feet If you think to distract me with this conversation Kabsal noted folding his arms and leaning back against the railing you wont be successful I sat up there with your disapproving mistress for well over an hour and let me say that it was not a pleasant experience I think she knows I still intend to try and convert her Of course she does Shes Jasnah She knows practically everything Except whatever it is she came here to study The Voidbringers Shallan said Thats what shes studying He frowned A few moments later the lift came to a rest on the appropriate floor The Voidbringers he said sounding curious Shed have expected him to be scornful or amused No she thought Hes an ardent He believes in them What were they she asked walking out Not far below the massive cavern came to a point There was a large infused diamond there marking the nadir We dont like to talk about it Kabsal said as he joined her Why not Youre an ardent This is part of your religion An unpopular part People prefer to hear about the Ten Divine Attributes or the Ten Human Failings We accommodate them because we also prefer that to the deep past Because she prodded Because he said with a sigh of our failure Shallan the devotariesat their coreare still classical Vorinism That means the Hierocracy and the fall of the Lost Radiants are our shame He held up his deep blue lantern Shallan strolled at his side curious letting him just talk We believe that the Voidbringers were real Shallan A scourge and a plague A hundred times they came upon mankind First casting us from the Tranquiline Halls then trying to destroy us here on Roshar They werent just spren that hid under rocks then came out to steal someones laundry They were creatures of terrible destructive power forged in Damnation created from hate By whom Shallan asked What Who made them I mean the Almighty wasnt likely to have created something from hate So what made them Everything has its opposite Shallan The Almighty is a force of good To balance his goodness the cosmere needed the Voidbringers as his opposite So the more good that the Almighty did the more evil he created as a byproduct Whats the point of doing any good at all if it just creates more evil I see Jasnah has continued your training in philosophy Thats not philosophy Shallan said Thats simple logic He sighed I dont think you want to get into the deep theology of this Suffice it to say that the Almightys pure goodness created the Voidbringers but men may choose good without creating evil because as mortals they have a dual nature Thus the only way for good to increase in the cosmere is for men to create itin that way good may come to outweigh evil All right she said But I dont buy the explanation about the Voidbringers I thought you were a believer I am But just because I honor the Almighty doesnt mean Im going to accept any explanation Kabsal It might be religion but it still has to make sense Didnt you once tell me that you didnt understand your own self Well yes And yet you expect to be able to understand the exact workings of the Almighty She drew her lips into a line All right fine But I still want to know more about the Voidbringers He shrugged as she guided him into an archive room filled with shelves of books I told you the basics Shallan The Voidbringers were an embodiment of evil We fought them off ninety and nine times led by the Heralds and their chosen knights the ten orders we call the Knights Radiant Finally Aharietiam came the Last Desolation The Voidbringers were cast back into the Tranquiline Halls The Heralds followed to force them out of heaven as well and Roshars Heraldic Epochs ended Mankind entered the Era of Solitude The modern era But why is everything from before so fragmented This was thousands and thousands of years ago Shallan Kabsal said Before history before men even knew how to forge steel We had to be given Shardblades otherwise we would have had to fight the Voidbringers with clubs And yet we had the Silver Kingdoms and the Knights Radiant Formed and led by the Heralds Shallan frowned counting off rows of shelves She stopped at the correct one handed her lantern to Kabsal then walked down the aisle and plucked the biography off the shelf Kabsal followed her holding up the lanterns Theres more to this Shallan said Otherwise Jasnah wouldnt be digging so hard I can tell you why shes doing it he said Shallan glanced at him Dont you see he said Shes trying to prove that the Voidbringers werent real She wants to demonstrate that this was all a fabrication of the Radiants He stepped forward and turned to face her the lanternlight rebounding from the books to either side making his face pale She wants to prove once and for all that the devotariesand Vorinismare a gigantic fraud Thats what this is all about Maybe Shallan said thoughtfully It did seem to fit What better goal for an avowed heretic Undermining foolish beliefs and disproving religion It explained why Jasnah would study something as seemingly inconsequential as the Voidbringers Find the right evidence in the historical records and Jasnah might well be able to prove herself right Havent we been scourged enough Kabsal said eyes angry The ardents are no threat to her Were not a threat to anyone these days We cant own propertyDamnation were property ourselves We dance to the whims of the citylords and warlords afraid to tell them the truths of their sins for fear of retribution Were whitespines without tusks or claws expected to sit at our masters feet and offer praise Yet this is real Its all real and they ignore us and He cut off suddenly glancing at her lips tight jaw clenched Shed never seen such fervor such fury from the pleasant ardent She wouldnt have thought him capable of it Im sorry he said turning from her leading the way back down the aisle Its all right she said hurrying after him suddenly feeling depressed Shallan had expected to find something grander something more mysterious behind Jasnahs secretive research Could it all really just be about proving Vorinism false They walked in silence out to the balcony And there she realized she had to tell him Kabsal Im leaving He looked at her surprised Ive had news from my family she said I cant speak of it but I can stay no longer Something about your father Why Have you heard something Only that hes been reclusive lately More than normal She suppressed a flinch News had gotten this far Im sorry to go so suddenly Youll return I dont know He looked into her eyes searching Do you know when youll be leaving he said in a suddenly cool voice Tomorrow morning Well then he said Will you at least do me the honor of sketching me Youve never given me a likeness though youve done many of the other ardents She started realizing that was true Despite their time together shed never done a sketch of Kabsal She raised her freehand to her mouth Im sorry He seemed taken aback I didnt mean it bitterly Shallan Its really not that important Yes it is she said grabbing his hand towing him along the walkway I left my drawing things up above Come on She hurried him to the lift instructing the parshmen to carry them up As the lift began to rise Kabsal looked at her hand in his She dropped it hastily Youre a very confusing woman he said stiffly I warned you She held the retrieved book close to her breast I believe you said you had me figured out I rescind that statement He looked at her Youre really leaving She nodded Im sorry KabsalIm not what you think I am I think youre a beautiful intelligent woman Well you have the woman part right Your father is sick isnt he She didnt answer I can see why youd want to return to be with him Kabsal said But surely you wont abandon your wardship forever Youll be back with Jasnah And she wont be staying in Kharbranth forever Shes been moving from place to place almost constantly for the last two years He looked ahead staring out the front of the lift as they rose Soon they had to transfer to another lift to carry them up the next group of floors I shouldnt have been spending time with you he finally said The senior ardents think Im too distracted They never like it when one of us starts looking outside the ardentia Your right to court is protected Were property A mans rights can be protected at the same time that he is discouraged from exercising them Ive avoided work Ive disobeyed my superiorsIn courting you Ive also courted trouble I didnt ask you for any of that You didnt discourage me She had no response for that other than to feel a rising worry A hint of panic a desire to run away and hide During her years of nearsolitude on her fathers estate she had never dreamed of a relationship like this one Is that what this is she thought panic swelling A relationship Her intentions in coming to Kharbranth had seemed so straightforward How had she gotten to the point where she risked breaking a mans heart And to her shame she admitted to herself that she would miss the research more than Kabsal Was she a horrible person for feeling that way She was fond of him He was pleasant Interesting He looked at her and there was longing in his eyes He seemedStormfather he seemed to really be in love with her Shouldnt she be falling in love with him too She didnt think she was She was just confused When they reached the top of the Palanaeums system of lifts she practically ran out into the Veil Kabsal followed but they needed another lift up to Jasnahs alcove and soon she found herself trapped with him once more I could come Kabsal said softly Return with you to Jah Keved Shallans panic increased She barely knew him Yes they had chatted frequently but rarely about the important things If he left the ardentia hed be demoted to tenth dahn almost as low as a darkeyes Hed be without money or house in almost as bad a position as her family Her family What would her brothers say if she brought a virtual stranger back with her Another man to become part of their problems privy to their secrets I can see from your expression that its not an option Kabsal said It seems that Ive misinterpreted some very important things No its not that Shallan said quickly Its justOh Kabsal How can you expect to make sense of my actions when even I cant make sense of them She touched his arm turning him toward her I have been dishonest with you And with Jasnah And most infuriatingly with myself Im sorry He shrugged obviously trying to feign nonchalance At least Ill get a sketch Wont I She nodded as the lift finally shuddered to a halt She walked down the dark hallway Kabsal following with the lanterns Jasnah looked up appraisingly as Shallan entered their alcove but did not ask why shed taken so long Shallan found herself blushing as she gathered her drawing tools Kabsal hesitated in the doorway Hed left a basket of bread and jam on the desk The top of it was still wrapped with a cloth Jasnah hadnt touched it though he always offered her some as a peace offering Without jam since Jasnah hated it Where should I sit Kabsal asked Just stand there Shallan said sitting down propping her sketchpad against her legs and holding it still with her covered safehand She looked up at him leaning with one hand against the doorframe Head shaved light grey robe draped around him sleeves short waist tied with a white sash Eyes confused She blinked taking a Memory then began to sketch It was one of the most awkward experiences of her life She didnt tell Kabsal that he could move and so he held the pose He didnt speak Perhaps he thought it would spoil the picture Shallan found her hand shaking as she sketched thoughthankfullyshe managed to hold back tears Tears she thought doing the final lines of the wall around Kabsal Why should I cry Im not the one who just got rejected Cant my emotions make sense once in a while Here she said pulling the page free and holding it up It will smudge unless you spray it with lacquer Kabsal hesitated then walked over taking the picture in reverent fingers Its wonderful he whispered He looked up then hurried to his lantern opening it and pulling out the garnet broam inside Here he said proffering it Payment I cant take that For one thing its not yours As an ardent anything Kabsal carried would belong to the king Please Kabsal said I want to give you something The picture is a gift she said If you pay me for it then I havent given you anything Then Ill commission another he said pressing the glowing sphere into her fingers Ill take the first likeness for free but do another for me please One of the two of us together She paused She rarely did sketches of herself They felt strange to draw All right She took the sphere then furtively tucked it into her safepouch beside her Soulcaster It was a little odd to carry something so heavy there but shed gotten accustomed to the bulge and weight Jasnah do you have a mirror she asked The other woman sighed audibly obviously annoyed by the distraction She felt through her things taking out a mirror Kabsal fetched it Hold it up beside your head Shallan said so I can see myself He walked back over doing so looking confused Angle it to the side a little Shallan said all right there She blinked freezing in her mind the image of her face beside his Have a seat You dont need the mirror any longer I just wanted it for referenceit helps me for some reason to place my features into the scene I want to sketch Ill put myself sitting beside you He sat on the floor and Shallan began to work using it to distract herself from her conflicting emotions Guilt at not feeling as strongly for Kabsal as he did for her yet sorrow that she wouldnt be seeing him anymore And above it all anxiety about the Soulcaster Sketching herself in beside him was challenging She worked furiously blending the reality of Kabsal sitting and a fiction of herself in her flowerembroidered dress sitting with her legs to the side The face in the mirror became her reference point and she built her head around it Too narrow to be beautiful with hair too light cheeks dotted with freckles The Soulcaster she thought Being here in Kharbranth with it is a danger But leaving is dangerous too Could there be a third option What if I sent it away She hesitated charcoal pencil hovering above the picture Dared she send the fabrialpackaged delivered to Tozbek in secretback to Jah Keved without her She wouldnt have to worry about being incriminated if her room or person were searched though shed want to destroy all pictures shed drawn of Jasnah with the Soulcaster And she wouldnt risk suspicion by vanishing when Jasnah discovered her Soulcaster didnt work She continued her drawing increasingly withdrawn into her thoughts letting her fingers work If she sent the Soulcaster back alone then she could stay in Kharbranth It was a golden tempting prospect but one that threw her emotions further into a jumbled mess Shed been preparing herself to leave for so long What would she do about Kabsal And Jasnah Could Shallan really remain here accepting Jasnahs freely given tutelage after what shed done Yes Shallan thought Yes I could The fervency of that emotion surprised her She would live with the guilt day by day if it meant continuing to learn It was terribly selfish of her and she was ashamed of it But she would do it for a little longer at least Shed have to go back eventually of course She couldnt leave her brothers to face danger alone They needed her Selfishness followed by courage She was nearly as surprised by the latter as she had been by the former Neither was something she often associated with who she was But she was coming to realize that she hadnt known who she was Not until she left Jah Keved and everything familiar everything shed been expected to be Her sketching grew more and more fervent She finished the figures and moved to the background Quick bold lines became the floor and the archway behind A scribbled dark smudge for the side of the desk casting a shadow Crisp thin lines for the lantern sitting on the floor Sweeping breezelike lines to form the legs and robes of the creature standing behind Shallan froze fingers drawing an unintended line of charcoal breaking away from the figure shed sketched directly behind Kabsal A figure that wasnt really there a figure with a sharp angular symbol hovering above its collar instead of a head Shallan stood throwing back her chair sketchpad and charcoal pencil clutched in the fingers of her freehand Shallan Kabsal said standing Shed done it again Why The peace shed begun to feel during the sketching evaporated in a heartbeat and her heart started to race The pressures returned Kabsal Jasnah Her brothers Decisions choices problems Is everything all right Kabsal said taking a step toward her Im sorry she said II made a mistake He frowned To the side Jasnah looked up brow wrinkled Its all right Kabsal said Look lets have some bread and jam We can calm down then you could finish it I dont care about a I need to go Shallan cut in feeling suffocated Im sorry She brushed past the dumbfounded ardent hurrying from the alcove giving a wide berth to the place where the figure stood in her sketch What was wrong with her She rushed to the lift calling for the parshmen to lower her She glanced over her shoulder Kabsal stood in the hallway looking after her Shallan reached the lift drawing pad clutched in her hand her heart racing Calm yourself she thought leaning back against the lift platforms wooden railing as the parshmen began to take her down She looked up at the empty landing above her And found herself blinking memorizing that scene She began sketching again She drew with concise motions sketchpad held against her safearm For illumination she had just two very small spheres at either side where the taut ropes quivered She moved without thought just drawing staring upward She looked down at what she had drawn Two figures stood on the landing above wearing the toostraight robes like cloth made from metal They leaned down watching her go She looked up again The landing was empty Whats happening to me she thought with increasing horror When the lift hit the ground she scrambled away her skirt fluttering She all but ran to the exit of the Veil hesitating beside the doorway ignoring the masterservants and ardents who gave her confused looks Where to go Sweat trickled down the sides of her face Where to run when you were going mad She cut into the main caverns crowd It was late afternoon and the dinner rush had begunservants pushing dining carts lighteyes strolling to their rooms scholars walking with hands behind their backs Shallan dashed through their midst her hair coming free of its bun the hairspike dropping to the rock behind her with a highpitched clink Her loose red hair streamed behind She reached the hallway leading to their rooms panting hair askew and glanced over her shoulder Amid the flow of traffic shed left a trail of people looking after her in confusion Almost against her will she blinked and took a Memory She raised her pad again gripping her charcoal pencil in slick fingers quickly sketching the crowded cavern scene Just faint impressions Men of lines women of curves walls of sloping rock carpeted floor bursts of light in sphere lanterns on the walls And five symbolheaded figures in black toostiff robes and cloaks Each had a different symbol twisted and unfamiliar to her hanging above a neckless torso The creatures wove through the crowd unseen Like predators Focused on Shallan Im just imagining it she tried to tell herself Im overtaxed too many things weighing on me Did they represent her guilt The stress of betraying Jasnah and lying to Kabsal The things she had done before leaving Jah Keved She tried to stand there waiting but her fingers refused to remain still She blinked then started drawing again on a new sheet She finished with a shaking hand The figures were almost to her angular notheads hanging horrifically where faces should have been Logic warned that she was overreacting but no matter what she told herself she couldnt believe it These were real And they were coming for her She dashed away surprising several servants who had been approaching her to offer assistance She ran slippered feet sliding on the hallway carpets eventually reaching the door to Jasnahs rooms Sketchpad under her arm she unlocked it with quivering fingers then pushed through and slammed it behind her She locked it again and ran for her chamber She slammed that door closed too then turned backing away The only light in the room came from the three diamond marks in the large crystal goblet on her nightstand She got on the bed then scrambled back as far from the door as she could until she was against the wall breathing through her nose with frantic breaths She still had her sketchpad under her arm though shed lost the charcoal There was more in her nightstand Dont do it she thought Just sit and calm yourself She felt a growing chill a rising terror She had to know She scrambled to pull out the charcoal then blinked and began to sketch her room Ceiling first Four straight lines Down the walls Lines at the corners Her fingers kept moving drawing depicting the pad itself held before her safehand shrouded and bracing the pad from behind And then on To the beings standing around hertwisted symbols unconnected to their uneven shoulders Those notheads had unreal angles surfaces that melded in weird impossible ways The creature at the front was reaching toosmooth fingers toward Shallan Just inches from the right side of the sketchpad Oh Stormfather Shallan thought charcoal pencil falling still The room was empty yet depicted right in front of her was an image of it crowded full of sleek figures They were close enough that she should be able to feel them breathing if they breathed Was there a chill in the room Hesitantlyterrified but unable to stop herselfShallan dropped her pencil and raised her freehand to the right And felt something She screamed then jumping to her feet on her bed dropping the pad backing against the wall Before she could consciously think of what she was doing she was struggling with her sleeve trying to get the Soulcaster out It was the only thing she had resembling a weapon No that was stupid She didnt know how to use it She was helpless Except Storms she thought frantic I cant use that I promised myself She began the process anyway Ten heartbeats to bring forth the fruit of her sin the proceeds of her most horrific act She was interrupted midway through by a voice uncanny yet distinct What are you She clutched her hand to her chest losing her balance on the soft bed falling to her knees on the rumpled blanket She put one hand to the side steadying herself on the nightstand fingers brushing the large glass goblet that sat there What am I she whispered Im terrified This is true The bedroom transformed around her The bed the nightstand her sketchpad the walls the ceilingeverything seemed to pop forming into tiny dark glass spheres She found herself in a place with a black sky and a strange small white sun that hung on the horizon too far away Shallan screamed as she found herself in midair falling backward in a shower of beads Flames hovered nearby dozens of them perhaps hundreds Like the tips of candles floating in the air and moving in the wind She hit something An endless dark sea except it wasnt wet It was made of the small beads an entire ocean of tiny glass spheres They surged around her moving in an undulating swell She gasped flailing trying to stay afloat You want me to change a warm voice said in her mind distinct and different from the cold whisper she had heard earlier It was deep and hollow and conveyed a sense of great age It seemed to come from her hand and she realized she was grasping something there One of the beads The movement of the ocean of glass threatened to tow her down she kicked frantically somehow managing to stay afloat Ive been as I am for a great long time the warm voice said I sleep so much I will change Give me what you have I dont know what you mean Please help me I will change She felt suddenly cold as if the warmth were being drawn from her She screamed as the bead in her fingers flared to sudden warmth She dropped it just as a shift in the ocean swell towed her under beads rolling over one another with a soft clatter She fell back and hit her bed back in her room Beside her the goblet on her nightstand melted the glass becoming red liquid dropping the three spheres inside to the nightstands flooded top The red liquid poured over the sides of the nightstand splashing to the floor Shallan pulled back horrified The goblet had been changed into blood Her shocked motion thumped the nightstand shaking it An empty glass water pitcher had been sitting beside the goblet Her motion knocked it over toppling it to the ground It shattered on the stone floor splashing the blood That was a Soulcasting she thought Shed changed the goblet into blood which was one of the Ten Essences She raised her hand to her head staring at the red liquid expanding in a pool on her floor There seemed to be quite a lot of it She was so bewildered The voice the creatures the sea of glass beads and the dark cold sky It had all come upon her so quickly I Soulcast she realized again I did it Did it have something to do with the creatures But shed begun seeing them in her drawings before shed ever stolen the Soulcaster Howwhat She looked down at her safehand and the Soulcaster hidden in the pouch inside her sleeve I didnt put it on she thought Yet I used it anyway Shallan It was Jasnahs voice Just outside Shallans room The princess must have followed her Shallan felt a spike of terror as she saw a line of blood leaking toward the doorway It was almost there and would pass underneath in a heartbeat Why did it have to be blood Nauseated she leaped to her feet slippers soaking up the red liquid Shallan Jasnah said voice closer What was that sound Shallan looked frantically at the blood then at the sketchpad filled with pictures of the strange creatures What if they did have something to do with the Soulcasting Jasnah would recognize them There was a shadow under the door She panicked tucking the sketchpad away in her trunk But the blood it would condemn her There was enough that only a lifethreatening wound could have created it Jasnah would see Shed know Blood where there should be none One of the Ten Essences Jasnah was going to know what Shallan had done A thought struck Shallan It wasnt a brilliant thought but it was a way out and it was the only thing that occurred to her She went to her knees and grabbed a shard of the broken glass pitcher in her safehand through the fabric of her sleeve She took a breath and pulled up her right sleeve then used the glass to cut a shallow gash in her skin In the panic of the moment it barely even hurt Blood welled out As the doorknob turned and the door opened Shallan dropped the glass shard and lay on her side She closed her eyes feigning unconsciousness The door swung open Jasnah gasped immediately calling for help She rushed to Shallans side grabbing her arm and putting pressure on the wound Shallan mumbled as if she were barely conscious gripping her safepouchand the Soulcaster insidewith her safehand They wouldnt open it would they She pulled her arm closer to her chest cowering silently as more footsteps and calls sounded servants and parshmen running into the room Jasnah shouting for more help This Shallan thought will not end well Though I was due for dinner in Veden City that night I insisted upon visiting Kholinar to speak with Tivbet The tariffs through Urithiru were growing quite unreasonable By then the socalled Radiants had already begun to show their true nature Following the firing of the original Palanaeum only one page of Terxims autobiography remained and this is the only line of any use to me Kaladin dreamed he was the storm He raged forward the stormwall behind him his trailing cape soaring above a heaving black expanse The ocean His passing churned up a tempest slamming waves into one another lifting white caps to be caught in his wind He approached a dark continent and soared upward Higher Higher He left the sea behind The vastness of the continent spread out before him seemingly endless an ocean of rock So large he thought awed He hadnt understood How could he have He roared past the Shattered Plains They looked as if something very large had hit them at the center sending rippling breaks outward They too were larger than hed expected no wonder nobody had been able to find their way through the chasms There was a large plateau at the center but with the darkness and the distance he could not see much There were lights though Someone lived there He did see that the eastern side of the plains was very different from the western side marked by tall spindly pillars plateaus that had nearly been worn away Despite that he could see a symmetry to the Shattered Plains From high above the plains resembled a work of art In a moment he was past them continuing north and west to soar across the Sea of Spears a shallow inland sea where broken fingers of rock jutted above the water He passed over Alethkar catching a glimpse of the great city of Kholinar built amid formations of rock like fins rising from the stone Then he turned southward away from anything he knew He crested majestic mountains densely populated at their tips with villages clustered near vents that emitted steam or lava The Horneater Peaks He left them with rain and winds rumbling down into foreign lands He passed cities and open plains villages and twisting waterways There were many armies Kaladin passed tents pulled flat against the leeward sides of rock formations stakes driven into the rock to hold them taut men hidden inside He passed hillsides where soldiers huddled in clefts He passed large wooden wagons built to house lighteyes while at war How many wars was the world fighting Was there nowhere that was at peace He took a path to the southwest blowing toward a city built in long troughs in the ground that looked like giant claw marks ripped across the landscape He was over it in a flash passing a hinterland where the stone itself was ribbed and rippled like frozen waves of water The people in this kingdom were darkskinned like Sigzil The land went on and on Hundreds of cities Thousands of villages People with faintly blue veins beneath their skin A place where the pressure of the approaching highstorm blew water out of spouts in the ground A city where people lived in gigantic hollowedout stalactites hanging beneath a titanic sheltered ridge Westward he blew The land was so vast So enormous So many different people It dazzled his mind War seemed far less prevalent in the West than it was in the East and that comforted him but still he was troubled Peace seemed a scarce commodity in the world Something drew his attention Strange flashes of light He blew toward them at the forefront of the storm What were those lights They came in bursts forming the strangest patterns Almost like physical things that he could reach out and touch spherical bubbles of light that vibrated with spikes and troughs Kaladin crossed a strange city laid out in a triangular pattern with tall peaks rising like sentries at the corners and center The flashes of light were coming from a building on the central peak Kaladin knew he would pass quickly for as the storm he could not retreat Ever westward he blew He threw open the door with his wind entering a long hallway with bright red tile walls mosaic murals that he passed too quickly to make out He rustled the skirts of tall goldenhaired serving women who carried trays of food or steaming towels They called in a strange language perhaps wondering who had left a window unbarred in a highstorm The flashes of light came from directly ahead So transfixing Brushing past a pretty goldand redhaired woman who huddled frightened in a corner Kaladin burst through a door He had one brief glimpse of what lay beyond A man stood over two corpses His pale head shaved his clothing white the murderer held a long thin sword in one hand He looked up from his victims and almost seemed to see Kaladin He had large Shin eyes It was too late to see anything more Kaladin blew out the window throwing shutters wide and streaking into the night More cities mountains and forests passed in a blur At his advent plants curled up their leaves rockbuds closed their shells and shrubs withdrew their branches Before long he neared the western ocean CHILD OF TANAVAST CHILD OF HONOR CHILD OF ONE LONG SINCE DEPARTED The sudden voice shook Kaladin he floundered in the air THE OOATHPACT WAS SHATTERED The booming sound made the stormwall itself vibrate Kaladin hit the ground separating from the storm He skidded to a stop feet throwing up sprays of water Stormwinds crashed into him but he was enough a part of them that they neither tossed nor shook him MEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER The voice was thunder crashing in the air THE OOATHPACT IS BROKEN CHILD OF HONOR I dont understand Kaladin screamed into the tempest A face formed before him the face he had seen before the aged face as wide as the sky its eyes full of stars ODIUM COMES MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL THE SIXTEEN YOU WILL NOW GO Something blew against him Wait Kaladin said Why is there so much war Must we always fight He wasnt sure why he asked The questions simply came out The storm rumbled like a thoughtful aged father The face vanished shattering into droplets of water More softly the voice answered ODIUM REIGNS Kaladin gasped as he awoke He was surrounded by dark figures holding him down against the hard stone floor He yelled old reflexes taking over Instinctively he snapped his hands outward to the sides each grabbing an ankle and jerking to pull two assailants off balance They cursed crashing to the ground Kaladin used the moment to twist while bringing an arm up in a sweep He knocked free the hands pushing him down rocked and threw himself forward lurching into the man directly in front of him Kaladin rolled over him tucking and coming up on his feet free of his captives He spun flinging sweat from his brow Where was his spear He clutched for the knife at his belt No knife No spear Storm you Kaladin That was Teft Kaladin raised a hand to his breast breathing deliberately dispelling the strange dream Bridge Four He was with Bridge Four The kings stormwardens had predicted a highstorm in the early morning hours Its all right he said to the cursing twisting clump of bridgemen who had been holding him down What were you doing You tried to go out in the storm Moash said accusingly extricating himself The only light was a single diamond sphere one of the men had set in the corner Ha Rock added standing up and brushing himself off Had the door open to the rain staring out as if youd been hit on the head with stone We had to pull you back Is not good for you to spend another two weeks sick in bed eh Kaladin calmed himself The riddensthe quiet rainfall at the trailing end of a highstormcontinued outside drops sprinkling the roof You wouldnt wake up Sigzil said Kaladin glanced at the Azish man sitting with his back to the stone wall He hadnt tried to hold Kaladin down You were having some kind of fever dream I feel just fine Kaladin said That wasnt quite true his head ached and he was exhausted He took a deep breath and threw back his shoulders trying to force the fatigue away The sphere in the corner flickered Then its light faded away leaving them in darkness Storm it Moash muttered That eel Gaz Hes been giving us dun spheres again Kaladin crossed the pitchblack barrack stepping carefully His headache faded away as he felt for the door He pushed it open letting in the faint light of an overcast morning The winds were weak but the rain still fell He stepped out and was shortly soaked through The other bridgemen followed him out and Rock tossed Kaladin a small chunk of soap Like most of the others Kaladin wore only his loincloth and he lathered himself up in the cold downpour The soap smelled of oil and was gritty with the sand suspended in it No sweet soft soaps for bridgemen Kaladin tossed the bit of soap to Bisig a thin bridgeman with an angular face He took it gratefullyBisig didnt say muchand began to lather up as Kaladin let the rain wash the soap from his body and hair To the side Rock was using a bowl of water to shave and trim his Horneater beard long on the sides and covering the cheeks but clean below the lips and chin It made an odd counterpoint to his head which he shaved up the center from directly above the eyebrows back He trimmed the rest of his hair short Rocks hand was smooth and careful and he didnt so much as nick himself Once finished he stood up and waved to the men waiting behind him One by one he shaved any who wanted it He occasionally paused to sharpen the razor using his whetstone and leather strop Kaladin raised his fingers to his own beard He hadnt been cleanshaven since hed been in Amarams army so long ago He walked forward to join those waiting in line When Kaladins time came the large Horneater laughed Sit my friend sit Is good you have come Your face is more like scragglebark branches than a proper beard Shave it clean Kaladin said sitting down on the stump And Id rather not have a strange pattern like yours Ha Rock said sharpening his razor You are a lowlander my good friend Is not right for you to wear a humakaaban I would have to thump you soundly if you tried this thing I thought you said fighting was beneath you Is allowed several important exceptions Rock said Now stop with your talking unless you wish to be losing a lip Rock began by trimming the beard down then lathered and shaved starting at the left cheek Kaladin had never let another shave him before when hed first gone to war hed been young enough that hed barely needed to shave at all Hed grown into doing it himself as he got older Rocks touch was deft and Kaladin didnt feel any nicks or cuts In a few minutes Rock stood back Kaladin raised his fingers to his chin touching smooth sensitive skin His face felt cold strange to the touch It took him back transformed himjust a littleinto the man he had been Strange how much difference a shave could make I should have done this weeks ago The riddens had turned to drizzle heralding the storms last whispers Kaladin stood up letting the water wash bits of shorn hair from his chest Babyfaced Dunnythe last of those waitingsat down for his turn at being shaven He hardly needed it at all The shave suits you a voice said Kaladin turned to see Sigzil leaning against the wall of the barrack just under the roofs overhang Your face has strong lines Square and firm with a proud chin We would call it a leaders face among my people Im no lighteyes Kaladin said spitting to the side You hate them so much I hate their lies Kaladin said I hate it that I used to believe they were honorable And would you cast them down Sigzil asked sounding curious Rule in their place No This seemed to surprise Sigzil To the side Syl finally appeared having finished frolicking in the winds of the highstorm He always worriedjust a littlethat shed ride away with them and leave him Have you no thirst to punish those who have treated you so Sigzil asked Oh Im happy to punish them Kaladin said But I have no desire to take their place nor do I wish to join them Id join them in a heartbeat Moash said walking up behind He folded his arms across his lean wellmuscled chest If I were in charge things would change The lighteyes would work the mines and the fields They would run bridges and die by Parshendi arrows Wont happen Kaladin said But I wont blame you for trying Sigzil nodded thoughtfully Have either of you ever heard of the land of Babatharnam No Kaladin said glancing toward the camp The soldiers were moving about now More than a few were washing too That a funny name for a country though Sigzil sniffed Personally I always thought Alethkar sounded like a ridiculous name I guess it depends on where you were raised So why bring up Babab Moash said Babatharnam Sigzil said I visited there once with my master They have very peculiar trees The entire planttrunk and alllies down when a highstorm approaches as if built on hinges I was thrown in prison three times during our visit there The Babath are quite particular about how you speak My master was quite displeased at the amount he had to pay to free me Of course I think they were using any excuse to imprison a foreigner as they knew my master had deep pockets He smiled wistfully One of those imprisonments was my fault The women there you see have these patterns of veins that sit shallowly beneath their skin Some visitors find it unnerving but I found the patterns beautiful Almost irresistible Kaladin frowned Hadnt he seen something like that in his dream I bring up Babath because they have a curious system of rule there Sigzil continued You see the elderly are given office The older you are the more authority you have Everyone gets a chance to rule if they live long enough The king is called the Most Ancient Sounds fair Moash said walking over to join Sigzil beneath the overhang Better than deciding who rules based on eye color Ah yes Sigzil said The Babath are very fair Currently the Monavakah Dynasty reigns How can you have a dynasty if you choose your leaders based on their age Kaladin asked Its actually quite easy Sigzil said You just execute anyone who gets old enough to challenge you Kaladin felt a chill They do that Yes unfortunately Sigzil said There is a great deal of unrest in Babatharnam It was dangerous to visit when we did The Monavakahs make very certain that their family members live the longest for fifty years no one outside their family has become Most Ancient All others have fallen through assassination exile or death on the battlefield Thats horrible Kaladin said I doubt many would disagree But I mention these horrors for a purpose You see it has been my experience that no matter where you go you will find some who abuse their power He shrugged Eye color is not so odd a method compared to many others I have seen If you were to overthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power Moash I doubt that the world would be a very different place The abuses would still happen Simply to other people Kaladin nodded slowly but Moash shook his head No Id change the world Sigzil And I mean to And how are you going to do that Kaladin asked amused I came to this war to get myself a Shardblade Moash said And I still mean to do it somehow He blushed then turned away You joined up assuming theyd make you a spearman didnt you Kaladin asked Moash hesitated then nodded Some of those who joined with me did become soldiers but most of us got sent to the bridge crews He glanced at Kaladin expression growing dark This plan of yours had better work lordling Last time I ran away I got a beating I was told if I tried again Id get a slaves mark instead I never promised it would work Moash If youve got a better idea go ahead and share it Moash hesitated Well if you really do teach us the spear like you promised then I guess I dont care Kaladin glanced about warily checking to see if Gaz or any bridgemen from other crews were nearby Keep quiet Kaladin muttered to Moash Dont speak of that outside of the chasms The rain had almost stopped soon the clouds would break Moash glared at him but remained silent You dont really think theyd let you have a Shardblade do you Sigzil said Any man can win a Shardblade Moash said Slave or free Lighteyes or dark Its the law Assuming they follow the law Kaladin said with a sigh Ill do it somehow Moash repeated He glanced to the side where Rock was closing up his razor and wiping the rainwater from his bald head The Horneater approached them I have heard of this place you spoke of Sigzil Rock said Babatharnam My cousin cousin cousin visited there one time They have very tasty snails That is a long distance to travel for a Horneater Sigzil noted Nearly same distance as for an Azish Rock said Actually much more since you have such little legs Sigzil scowled I have seen your kind before Rock said folding his arms What Sigzil asked Azish We are not so rare No not your race Rock said Your type What is it they are called Visiting places around the land telling others of what they have seen A Worldsinger Yes is the right name No Sigzil froze Then he suddenly stood up straight and stalked away from the barrack without looking back Now why is he acting like this thing Rock asked I am not ashamed of being cook Why is he ashamed of being Worldsinger Worldsinger Kaladin asked Rock shrugged I do not know much Are strange people Say they must travel to each kingdom and tell the people there of other kingdoms Is a kind of storyteller though they are thinking of themselves as much more Hes probably some kind of brightlord in his country Moash said The way he talks Wonder how he ended up with us cremlings Hey Dunny said joining them Whatd you do to Sigzil He promised to tell me about my homeland Homeland Moash said to the younger man Youre from Alethkar Sigzil said these violet eyes of mine arent native to Alethkar He thinks I must have Veden blood in me Your eyes arent violet Moash said Sure they are Dunny said You can see it in bright sunlight Theyre just really dark Ha Rock said If you are from Vedenar we are cousins The Peaks are near Vedenar Sometimes the people there have good red hair like us Be glad that someone didnt mistake your eyes for red Dunny Kaladin said Moash Rock go gather your subsquads and pass the word to Teft and Skar I want the men oiling their vests and sandals against the humidity The men sighed but did as ordered The army provided the oil While the bridgemen were expendable good hogshide and metal for buckles were not cheap As the men gathered to work the sun broke through the clouds The warmth of the light felt good on Kaladins rainwet skin There was something refreshing about the chill of a highstorm followed by the sun Tiny rockbud polyps on the side of the building opened drinking in the wet air Those would have to be scraped free Rockbuds would eat away the stone of the walls creating pockmarks and cracks The buds were a deep crimson It was Chachel third day of the week The slave markets would show new wares That would mean new bridgemen Kaladins crew was in serious danger Yake had caught an arrow in the arm during their last run and Delp had caught one in the neck Thered been nothing Kaladin could do for him and with Yake wounded Kaladins team was down to twentyeight bridgecapable members Sure enough about an hour into their morning activitiescaring for equipment oiling the bridge Lopen and Dabbid running to fetch their morning gruel pot and bring it back to the lumberyardKaladin caught sight of soldiers leading a line of dirty shuffling men toward the lumberyard Kaladin gestured to Teft and the two of them marched up to meet Gaz Afore you yell at me Gaz said as Kaladin arrived understand that I cant change anything here The slaves were bunched up watched over by a pair of soldiers in wrinkled green coats Youre bridge sergeant Kaladin said Teft stepped up beside him He hadnt gotten a shave though hed begun keeping his short grey beard neatly trimmed Yeah Gaz said but I dont make assignments any more Brightness Hashal wants to do it herself In the name of her husband of course Kaladin gritted his teeth Shed starve Bridge Four of members So we get nothing I didnt say that Gaz said then spat black spittle to the side She gave you one Thats something at least Kaladin thought There were a good hundred men in the new group Which one Hed better be tall enough to carry a bridge Oh hes tall enough Gaz said gesturing a few slaves out of the way Good worker too The men shuffled aside revealing one man standing at the back He was a little shorter than average but he was still tall enough to carry a bridge But he had black and red marbled skin A parshman Kaladin asked To his side Teft cursed under his breath Why not Gaz said Theyre perfect slaves Never talk back But were at war with them Teft said Were at war with a tribe of oddities Gaz said Those out on the Shattered Plains are right different from the fellows who work for us That much at least was true There were a lot of parshmen in the warcamp anddespite their skin markingsthere was little similarity between them and the Parshendi warriors None had the strange growths of armorlike carapace on their skin for instance Kaladin eyed the sturdy bald man The parshman stared at the ground he wore only a loincloth and he had a thickness about him His fingers were thicker than those of human men his arms stouter his thighs wider Hes domesticated Gaz said You dont need to worry I thought parshmen were too valuable to use in bridge runs Kaladin said This is just an experiment Gaz said Brightness Hashal wants to know her options Finding enough bridgemen has been difficult lately and parshmen could help fill in holes This is foolishness Gaz Teft said I dont care if hes domesticated or not Asking him to carry a bridge against others of his kind is pure idiocy What if he betrays us Gaz shrugged Well see if that happens But Leave it Teft Kaladin said You parshman come with me He turned to walk back down the hill The parshman dutifully followed Teft cursed and did so as well What trick are they trying on us do you think Teft asked I suspect its just what he said A test to see if a parshman can be trusted to run bridges Perhaps hell do as hes told Or perhaps hell refuse to run or will try to kill us She wins regardless Keleks breath Teft cursed Darker than a Horneaters stomach our situation is Shell see us dead Kaladin I know He glanced over his shoulder at the parshman He was a little taller than most his face a little wider but they all looked about the same to Kaladin The other members of Bridge Four had lined up by the time Kaladin returned They watched the approaching parshman with surprise and disbelief Kaladin stopped before them Teft at his side the parshman behind It made him itch to have one of them behind him He casually stepped to the side The parshman just stood there eyes downward shoulders slumped Kaladin glanced at the others They had guessed and they were growing hostile Stormfather Kaladin thought There is something lower in this world than a bridgeman A parshman bridgeman Parshmen might cost more than most slaves but so did a chull In fact the comparison was a good one because parshmen were worked like animals Seeing the reaction of the others made Kaladin pity the creature And that made him mad at himself Did he always have to react this way This parshman was dangerous a distraction for the other men a factor they couldnt depend on A liability Turn a liability into an advantage whenever you can Those words had been spoken by a man who cared only for his own skin Storm it Kaladin thought Im a fool A downright sodden idiot This isnt the same Not at all Parshman he asked Do you have a name The man shook his head Parshmen rarely spoke They could but you had to prod them into it Well well have to call you something Kaladin said How about Shen The man shrugged All right then Kaladin said to the others This is Shen Hes one of us now A parshman Lopen asked lounging beside the barrack I dont like him gancho Look how he stares at me Hell kill us while we sleep Moash added No this is good Skar said We can just have him run at the front Hell take an arrow for one of us Syl alighted on Kaladins shoulder looking down at the parshman Her eyes were sorrowful If you were to overthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power abuses would still happen Theyd just happen to other people But this was a parshman Got ta do what you can to stay alive No Kaladin said Shen is one of us now I dont care what he was before I dont care what any of you were Were Bridge Four So is he But Skar began No Kaladin said We not going to treat him like the lighteyes treat us Skar Thats all there is to it Rock find him a vest and sandals The bridgemen split up all save Teft What aboutour plans Teft asked quietly We proceed Kaladin said Teft looked uncomfortable about that Whats he going to do Teft Kaladin asked Tell on us Ive never heard a parshman say more than a single word at a time I doubt he could act as a spy I dont know Teft grumbled But Ive never liked them They seem to be able to talk to each other without making any sounds I dont like the way they look Teft Kaladin said flatly if we rejected bridgemen based on their looks wed have kicked you out weeks ago for that face of yours Teft grunted Then he smiled What Kaladin asked Nothing he said Justfor a moment you reminded me of better days Afore this storm came crashing down on me You realize the odds dont you Fighting our way free escaping a man like Sadeas Kaladin nodded solemnly Good Teft said Well since you arent inclined to do it Ill keep an eye on our friend Shen over there You can thank me after I stop him from sticking a knife in your back I dont think we have to worry Youre young Teft said Im old That makes you wiser presumably Damnation no Teft said The only thing it proves is that Ive more experience staying alive than you Ill watch him You just train the rest of this sorry lot to He trailed off looking around To keep from tripping over their own feet the moment someone threatens them You understand Kaladin nodded That sounded much like something one of Kaladins old sergeants would say Teft was insistent on not talking about his past but he never had seemed as beaten down as most of the others All right Kaladin said make sure the men take care of their equipment What will you be doing Walking Kaladin said And thinking An hour later Kaladin still wandered Sadeass warcamp Hed need to return to the lumberyard soon his men were on chasm duty again and had been given only a few free hours to care for equipment As a youth he hadnt understood why his father had often gone walking to think The older Kaladin grew the more he found himself imitating his fathers habits Walking moving it did something to his mind The constant passing of tents colors cycling men bustlingit created a sense of change and it made his thoughts want to move as well Dont hedge bets with your life Kaladin Durk had always said Dont put in a chip when you have a pocket full of marks Bet them all or leave the table Syl danced before him jumping from shoulder to shoulder in the crowded street Occasionally shed land on the head of someone passing in the other direction and sit there legs crossed as she passed Kaladin All his spheres were on the table He was determined to help the bridgemen But something itched at him a worry that he couldnt yet explain You seem troubled Syl said landing on his shoulder She wore a cap and jacket over her usual dress as if imitating nearby shop keepers They passed the apothecarys shop Kaladin barely bothered to glance at it He had no knobweed sap to sell Hed run out of supplies soon Hed told his men that hed train them to fight but that would take time And once they were trained how would they get spears out of the chasms to use in the escape Sneaking them out would be tough considering how they were searched They could just start fighting at the search itself but that would only put the entire warcamp on alert Problems problems The more he thought the more impossible his task seemed He made way for a couple of soldiers in forestgreen coats Their brown eyes marked them as common citizens but the white knots on their shoulders meant they were citizen officers Squadleaders and sergeants Kaladin Syl asked Getting the bridgemen out is as large a task as Ive ever faced Much more difficult than my other escape attempts as a slave and I failed at each of those I cant help wondering if Im setting myself up for another disaster It will be different this time Kaladin Syl said I can feel it That sounds like something Tien would have said His death proves that words dont change anything Syl Before you ask Im not sinking into despair again But I cant ignore what has happened to me It started with Tien Since that moment it seems that every time Ive specifically picked people to protect theyve ended up dead Every time Its enough to make me wonder if the Almighty himself hates me She frowned I think youre being foolish Besides if anything hed hate the people who died not you You lived I suppose its selfcentered to make it all about me But Syl I survive every time when almost nobody else does Over and over again My old spearmans squad the first bridge crew I ran with numerous slaves I tried to help escape Theres a pattern Its getting harder and harder to ignore Maybe the Almighty is preserving you Syl said Kaladin hesitated on the street a passing soldier cursed and shoved him aside Something about this whole conversation was wrong Kaladin moved over beside a rain barrel set between two sturdy stonewalled shops Syl he said You mentioned the Almighty You did first Ignore that for now Do you believe in the Almighty Do you know if he really exists Syl cocked her head I dont know Huh Well there are a lot of things I dont know But I should know this one I think Maybe She seemed very perplexed Im not sure if I believe Kaladin said looking out at the street My mother did and my father always spoke of the Heralds with reverence I think he believed too but maybe just because of the traditions of healing that are said to have come from the Heralds The ardents ignore us bridgemen They used to visit the soldiers when I was in Amarams army but I havent seen a single one in the lumberyard I havent given it much thought Believing never seemed to help any of the soldiers So if you dont believe then theres no reason to think that the Almighty hates you Except Kaladin said if there is no Almighty there might be something else I dont know A lot of the soldiers I knew were superstitious Theyd talk about things like the Old Magic and the Nightwatcher things that could bring a man bad luck I scoffed at them But how long can I continue to ignore that possibility What if all of these failures can be traced to something like that Syl looked disturbed The cap and jacket shed been wearing dissolved to mist and she wrapped her arms around herself as if chilled by his comments Odium reigns Syl he said frowning thinking back to his strange dream Have you ever heard of something called Odium I dont mean the feeling I meana person or something called by that name Syl suddenly hissed It was a feral disturbing sound She zipped off his shoulder becoming a darting streak of light and shot up underneath the eaves of the next building He blinked Syl he called drawing the attention of a couple of passing washwomen The spren did not reappear Kaladin folded his arms That word had set her off Why A loud series of curses interrupted his thoughts Kaladin spun as a man burst out of a handsome stone building across the street and shoved a halfnaked woman out in front of him The man had bright blue eyes and his coatcarried over one armhad red knots on the shoulder A lighteyed officer not very highranking Perhaps seventh dahn The halfdressed woman fell to the ground She held the loose front of the dress to her chest crying her long black hair down and tied with two red ribbons The dress was that of a lighteyed woman except that both sleeves were short safehand exposed A courtesan The officer continued to curse as he pulled on his coat He didnt do up the buttons Instead he stepped forward and kicked the whore in the belly She gasped painspren pulling from the ground and gathering around her Nobody on the street paused though most did hurry on their way heads down Kaladin growled jumping into the roadway pushing his way past a group of soldiers Then he stopped Three men in blue stepped out of the crowd moving purposefully between the fallen woman and the officer in red Only one was lighteyed judging by the knots on his shoulders Golden knots A highranking man indeed second or third dahn These obviously werent from Sadeass army not with those wellpressed blue coats Sadeass officer hesitated The officer in blue rested his hand on the hilt of his sword The other two were holding fine halberds with gleaming halfmoon heads A group of soldiers in red moved out of the crowd and began to surround those in blue The air grew tense and Kaladin realized that the streetbustling just moments agowas quickly emptying He stood practically alone the only one watching the three men in blue now surrounded by seven in red The woman was still on the ground sniffling She huddled next to the blue garbed officer The man who had kicked hera thickbrowed brute with a mop of uncombed black hairbegan to button up the right side of his coat You dont belong here friends It seems you wandered into the wrong warcamp We have legitimate business said the officer in blue He had light golden hair speckled with Alethi black and a handsome face He held his hand before him as if wishing to shake hands with Sadeass officer Come now he said affably Whatever your problem with this woman Im sure it can be resolved without anger or violence Kaladin moved back under the overhang where Syl had hidden Shes a whore Sadeass man said I can see that replied the man in blue He kept his hand out The officer in red spat on it I see said the blond man He pulled his hand back and twisting lines of mist gathered in the air coalescing in his hands as he raised them to an offensive posture A massive sword appeared as long as a man is tall It dripped with water that condensed along its cold glimmering length It was beautiful long and sinuous its single edge rippled like an eel and curved up into a point The back bore delicate ridges like crystal formations Sadeass officer stumbled away and fell his face pale The soldiers in red scattered The officer cursed at themas vile a curse as Kaladin had ever heardbut none returned to help him With a final glare he scrambled up the steps back into the building The door slammed leaving the roadway eerily silent Kaladin was the only one on the street besides the soldiers in blue and the fallen courtesan The Shardbearer gave Kaladin a glance but obviously judged him no threat He thrust his sword into the stones the blade sank in easily and stood with its hilt toward the sky The young Shardbearer then gave his hand to the fallen whore What did you do to him out of curiosity Hesitantly she took his hand and let him pull her to her feet He refused to pay claiming his reputation made it a pleasure for me She grimaced He kicked me the first time after I made a comment about his reputation It apparently wasnt what he thought he was known for The brightlord chuckled I suggest you insist on being paid first from now on Well escort you to the border I advise against returning to Sadeass warcamp anytime soon The woman nodded holding the front of her dress to her chest Her safehand was still exposed Sleek with tan skin the fingers long and delicate Kaladin found himself staring at it and blushing She sidled up to the brightlord while his two comrades watched the sides of the streets halberds ready Even with her hair disheveled and her makeup smudged she was quite pretty Thank you Brightlord Perhaps I could interest you There would be no charge The young brightlord raised an eyebrow Tempting he said but my father would kill me He has this thing about the old ways A pity she said pulling away from him awkwardly covering her chest as she slipped her arm into its sleeve She took out a glove for her safehand Your father is quite prudish then You might say that He turned toward Kaladin Ho bridgeboy Bridgeboy This lordling looked to be just a few years older than Kaladin himself Run and give word to Brightlord Reral Makoram the Shardbearer said flipping something across the street toward Kaladin A sphere It sparkled in the sunlight before Kaladin caught it Hes in the Sixth Battalion Tell him that Adolin Kholin wont make todays meeting Ill send word to reschedule another time Kaladin looked down at the sphere An emerald chip More than he normally earned in two weeks He looked up the young brightlord and his two men were already retreating the whore following You rushed to help her a voice said He looked up as Syl floated down to rest on his shoulder That was very noble of you Those others got there first Kaladin said And one of them a lighteyes no less What was in it for him You still tried to help Foolishly Kaladin said What would I have done Fought down a lighteyes That would have drawn half the camps soldiers down on me and the whore would just have been beaten more for causing such a fracas She could have ended up dead for my efforts He fell silent That sounded too much like what hed been saying before He couldnt give in to assuming he was cursed or had bad luck or whatever it was Superstition never got a man anywhere But he had to admit the pattern was disturbing If he acted as he always had before how could he expect different results He had to try something new Change somehow This was going to take more thought Kaladin began walking back toward the lumberyard Arent you going to do what the brightlord asked Syl said She didnt show any lingering effects of her sudden fright it was as if she wanted to pretend it hadnt happened After how he treated me Kaladin snapped It wasnt that bad Im not going to bow to them Kaladin said Im done running at their whims just because they expect me to do so If he was so worried about this message then he should have waited to make certain I was willing You took his sphere Earned by the sweat of the darkeyes he exploits Syl fell silent for a moment This darkness about you when you talk of them frightens me Kaladin You stop being yourself when you think about lighteyes He didnt respond just continuing on his way He owed that brightlord nothing and besides he had orders to be back in the lumberyard But the man had stepped up to protect the woman No Kaladin told himself forcefully He was just looking for a way to embarrass one of Sadeass officers Everyone knows theres tension between the camps And that was all he let himself think on the subject ONE YEAR AGO Kaladin turned the rock over in his fingers letting the facets of suspended quartz catch the light He leaned against a large boulder one foot pressed back against the stone his spear next to him The rock caught the light spinning it in different colors depending on the direction he turned it Beautiful miniature crystals shimmered like the cities made of gemstones mentioned in lore Around him Highmarshal Amarams army prepared for battle Six thousand men sharpened spears or strapped on leather armor The battlefield was nearby and with no highstorms expected the army had spent the night in tents It had been nearly four years since hed joined Amarams army on that rainy night Four years And an eternity Soldiers hurried this way and that Some raised hands and called greetings to Kaladin He nodded to them pocketing the stone then folded his arms to wait In the near distance Amarams standard was already flying a burgundy field blazoned with a dark green glyphpair shaped like a whitespine with tusks upraised Merem and khakh honor and determination The banner fluttered before a rising sun the mornings chill starting to give way to the heat of the day Kaladin turned looking eastward Toward a home to which he could never return Hed decided months ago His enlistment would be up in a few weeks but he would sign on again He couldnt face his parents after having broken his promise to protect Tien A heavyset darkeyed soldier trotted up to him an axe strapped to his back white knots on his shoulders The nonstandard weapon was a privilege of being a squadleader Gare had beefy forearms and a thick black beard though hed lost a large section of scalp on the right side of his head He was followed by two of his sergeantsNalem and Korabet Kaladin Gare said Stormfather man Why are you pestering me On a battle day Im well aware of whats ahead Gare Kaladin said arms still folded Several companies were already gathering forming ranks Dallet would see Kaladins own squad into place At the front theyd decided Their enemya lighteyes named Hallawwas fond of long volleys Theyd fought his men several times before One time in particular was burned into Kaladins memory and soul He had joined Amarams army expecting to defend the Alethi bordersand defend them he did Against other Alethi Lesser landlords who sought to slice off bits of Highprince Sadeass lands Occasionally Amarams armies would try to seize territory from other highprinceslands Amaram claimed really belonged to Sadeas and had been stolen years before Kaladin didnt know what to make of that Of all lighteyes Amaram was the only one he trusted But it did seem like they were doing the same thing as the armies they fought Kaladin Gare asked impatiently You have something I want Kaladin said New recruit just joined yesterday Galan says his name is Cenn Gare scowled Im supposed to play this game with you now Talk to me after the battle If the boy survives maybe Ill give him to you He turned to leave cronies following Kaladin stood up straight picking up his spear The motion stopped Gare in his tracks Its not going to be a trouble to you Kaladin said quietly Just send the boy to my squad Accept your payment Stay quiet He pulled out a pouch of spheres Maybe I dont want to sell him Gare said turning back Youre not selling him Youre transferring him to me Gare eyed the pouch Well then maybe I dont like how everyone does what you tell them I dont care how good you are with a spear My squad is my own Im not going to give you any more Gare Kaladin said dropping the pouch to the ground The spheres clinked We both know the boy is useless to you Untrained illequipped too small to make a good line soldier Send him to me Kaladin turned and began to walk away Within seconds he heard a clink as Gare recovered the pouch Cant blame a man for trying Kaladin kept walking What do these recruits mean to you anyway Gare called after Kaladin Your squad is half made up of men too small to fight properly Almost makes a man think you want to get killed Kaladin ignored him He passed through the camp waving to those who waved at him Most everyone kept out of his way either because they knew and respected him or theyd heard of his reputation Youngest squadleader in the army only four years of experience and already in command A darkeyed man had to travel to the Shattered Plains to go any higher in rank The camp was a bedlam of soldiers hurrying about in lastminute preparations More and more companies were gathering at the line and Kaladin could see the enemy lining up on the shallow ridge across the field to the west The enemy That was what they were called Yet whenever there was an actual border dispute with the Vedens or the Reshi those men would line up beside Amarams troops and they would fight together It was as if the Nightwatcher toyed with them playing some forbidden game of chance occasionally setting the men on his gameboard as allies then setting them to kill one another the next day That wasnt for spearmen to think about So hed been told Repeatedly He supposed he should listen as he figured that his duty was to keep his squad alive as best he could Winning was secondary to that You cant kill to protect He found the surgeons station easily he could smell the scents of antiseptics and of small fires burning Those smells reminded him of his youth which now seemed so far far away Had he ever really planned to go become a surgeon What had happened to his parents What of Roshone Meaningless now Hed sent word to them via Amarams scribes a terse note that had cost him a weeks wages They knew hed failed and they knew he didnt intend to return There had been no reply Ven was the chief of the surgeons a tall man with a bulbous nose and a long face He stood watching as his apprentices folded bandages Kaladin had once idly considered getting wounded so he could join them all of the apprentices had some incapacitation that prevented them from fighting Kaladin hadnt been able to do it Wounding himself seemed cowardly Besides surgery was his old life In a way he didnt deserve it anymore Kaladin pulled a pouch of spheres from his belt meaning to toss it to Ven The pouch stuck however refusing to come free of the belt Kaladin cursed stumbling tugging at the pouch It came free suddenly causing him to lose his balance again A translucent white form zipped away spinning with a carefree air Storming windspren he said They were common out on these rocky plains He continued past the surgery pavilion tossing the pouch of spheres to Ven The tall man caught it deftly making it vanish into a pocket of his voluminous white robe The bribe would ensure that Kaladins men were served first on the battlefield assuming there were no lighteyes who needed the attention It was time to join the line He sped up jogging along spear in hand Nobody gave him grief for wearing trousers under his leather spearmans skirtsomething he did so his men could recognize him from behind In fact nobody gave him grief about much of anything these days That still felt odd after so many struggles during his first years in the army He still didnt feel as if he belonged His reputation set him apart but what was he to do It kept his men from being taunted and after several years of dealing with disaster after disaster he could finally pause and think He wasnt certain he liked that Thinking had proven dangerous lately It had been a long while since hed taken out that rock and thought of Tien and home He made his way to the front ranks spotting his men right where hed told them to go Dallet Kaladin called as he trotted over to the mountainous spearman who was the squads sergeant Were soon going to have a new recruit I need you to He trailed off A young man maybe fourteen stood beside Dallet looking tiny in his spearmans armor Kaladin felt a flash of recall Another lad one with a familiar face holding a spear he wasnt supposed to need Two promises broken at once He found his way here just a few minutes ago sir Dallet said Ive been gettin him ready Kaladin shook himself out of the moment Tien was dead But Stormfather this new lad looked a lot like him Well done Kaladin said to Dallet forcing himself to look away from Cenn I paid good money to get that boy away from Gare That mans so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side Dallet grunted in agreement The men would know what to do with Cenn All right Kaladin thought scanning the battlefield for a good place for his men to stand their ground lets get to it Hed heard stories about the soldiers who fought on the Shattered Plains The real soldiers If you showed enough promise fighting in these border disputes you were sent there It was supposed to be safer therefar more soldiers but fewer battles So Kaladin wanted to get his squad there as soon as possible He conferred with Dallet picking a place to hold Eventually the horns blew Kaladins squad charged Wheres the boy Kaladin said yanking his spear out of the chest of a man in brown The enemy soldier fell to the ground groaning Dallet The burly sergeant was fighting He couldnt turn to acknowledge the yell Kaladin cursed scanning the chaotic battlefield Spears hit shields flesh leather men yelled and screamed Painspren swarmed the ground like small orange hands or bits of sinew reaching up from the ground amid the blood of the fallen Kaladins squad was all accounted for their wounded protected at the center All except the new boy Tien Cenn Kaladin thought His name is Cenn Kaladin caught sight of a flash of green in the middle of the enemy brown A terrified voice somehow cut through the commotion It was him Kaladin threw himself out of formation prompting a call of surprise from Larn who had been fighting at his side Kaladin ducked past a spear thrust by an enemy dashing over the stony ground hopping corpses Cenn had been knocked to the ground spear raised An enemy soldier slammed his weapon down No Kaladin blocked the blow deflecting the enemy spear and skidding to a stop in front of Cenn There were six spearmen here all wearing brown Kaladin spun among them in a wild offensive rush His spear seemed to flow of its own accord He swept the feet out from under one man took down another with a thrown knife He was like water running down a hill flowing always moving Spearheads flashed in the air around him hafts hissing with speed Not one hit him He could not be stopped not when he felt like this When he had the energy of defending the fallen the power of standing to protect one of his men Kaladin snapped his spear into a resting position crouching with one foot forward one behind spear held under his arm Sweat trickled from his brow cooled by the breeze Odd There hadnt been a breeze before Now it seemed to envelop him All six enemy spearmen were dead or incapacitated Kaladin breathed in and out once then turned to see to Cenns wound He dropped his spear beside him kneeling The cut wasnt that bad though it probably pained the lad terribly Getting out a bandage Kaladin gave the battlefield one quick glance Nearby an enemy soldier stirred but he was wounded badly enough that he wouldnt be trouble Dallet and the rest of Kaladins team were clearing the area of enemy stragglers In the near distance an enemy lighteyes of high rank was rallying a small group of soldiers for a counterattack He wore full plate Not Shardplate of course but silvery steel A rich man judging from his horse In a heartbeat Kaladin was back to binding Cenns legthough he kept watch on the wounded enemy soldier from the corner of his eye Kaladin sir Cenn exclaimed pointing at the soldier who had stirred Stormfather Had the boy only just noticed the man Had Kaladins battle senses ever been as dull as this boys Dallet pushed the wounded enemy away The rest of the squad made a ring formation around Kaladin Dallet and Cenn Kaladin finished his binding then stood picking up his spear Dallet handed him back his knives Had me worried there sir Running off like that I knew youd follow Kaladin said Raise the red banner Cyn Korater youre going back with the boy Dallet hold here Amarams line is bulging this direction We should be safe soon And you sir Dallet asked In the near distance the lighteyes had failed to rally enough troops He was exposed like a stone left behind by a stream running dry A Shardbearer Cenn said Dallet snorted No thank the Stormfather Just a lighteyed officer Shardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute Kaladin clenched his jaw watching that lighteyed warrior How mighty the man thought himself sitting on his expensive horse kept safe from the spearmen by his majestic armor and tall mount He swung his mace killing those around him These skirmishes were caused by ones like him greedy minor lighteyes who tried to steal land while the better men were away fighting the Parshendi His type had far far fewer casualties than the spearmen and so the lives under his command became cheap things More and more over the last few years each and every one of these petty lighteyes had come to represent Roshone in Kaladins eyes Only Amaram himself stood apart Amaram who had treated Kaladins father so well promising to keep Tien safe Amaram who always spoke with respect even to lowly spearmen He was like Dalinar and Sadeas Not this riffraff Of course Amaram had failed to protect Tien But so had Kaladin Sir Dallet said hesitantly Subsquads Two and Three pincer pattern Kaladin said coldly pointing at the enemy lighteyes Were taking a brightlord off his throne You sure thats wise sir Dallet said Weve got wounded Kaladin turned toward Dallet Thats one of Hallaws officers He might be the one You dont know that sir Regardless hes a battalionlord If we kill an officer that high were all but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains Were taking him Imagine it Dallet Real soldiers A warcamp with discipline and lighteyes with integrity A place where our fighting will mean something Dallet sighed but nodded At Kaladins wave two subsquads joined him as eager as he Did they hate these squabbling lighteyes of their own accord or had they picked up Kaladins loathing The brightlord was surprisingly easy to take down The problem with themalmost to a manwas that they underestimated darkeyes Perhaps this one had a right How many had he killed in his years Subsquad three drew off the honor guard Subsquad two distracted the lighteyes He didnt see Kaladin approaching from a third direction The man dropped with a knife to the eye his face was unprotected He screamed as he clattered to the ground still alive Kaladin rammed his spear down into the fallen mans face striking three times as the horse galloped off The mans honor guard panicked and fled to rejoin their army Kaladin signaled to the two subsquads by banging his spear against his shield giving the hold position sign They fanned out and short Toorima man Kaladin had rescued from another squadmade as if to confirm the lighteyes was dead He was really covertly looking for spheres Stealing from the dead was strictly prohibited but Kaladin figured that if Amaram wanted the spoils he could storming well kill the enemy himself Kaladin respected Amaram more than mostwell more than anylighteyes But bribes werent cheap Toorim walked up to him Nothing sir Either he didnt bring any spheres into battle or he has them hidden somewhere under that breastplate Kaladin nodded curtly surveying the battlefield Amarams forces were recovering theyd win the day before long In fact Amaram would probably be leading a direct surge against the enemy by now He generally entered the battle at the end Kaladin wiped his brow Hed have to send for Norby their captainlord to prove their kill First he needed those healers to Sir Toorim said suddenly Kaladin glanced back at the enemy lines Stormfather Toorim exclaimed Sir Toorim wasnt looking at the enemy lines Kaladin spun looking back at friendly ranks Therebearing down through the soldiers on a horse the color of death itselfwas an impossibility The man wore shining golden armor Perfect golden armor as if this were what every other suit of armor had been designed to imitate Each piece fit perfectly there were no holes showing straps or leather It made the rider look enormous powerful Like a god carrying a majestic blade that should have been too big to use It was engraved and stylized shaped like flames in motion Stormfather Kaladin breathed The Shardbearer broke out of Amarams lines Hed been riding through them cutting down men as he passed For a brief moment Kaladins mind refused to acknowledge that this creaturethis beautiful divinitycould be an enemy The fact that the Shardbearer had come through their side reinforced that illusion Kaladins confusion lasted right up until the moment the Shardbearer trampled Cenn Shardblade dropping and cutting through Dallets head in a single easy stroke No Kaladin bellowed No Dallets body fell back to the ground eyes seeming to catch alight smoke rising from them The Shardbearer cut down Cyn and trampled Lyndel before moving on It was all done with nonchalance like a woman pausing to wipe a spot on the counter NO Kaladin screamed charging toward the fallen men of his squad He hadnt lost anyone this battle He was going to protect them all He fell to his knees beside Dallet dropping his spear But there was no heartbeat and those burnedout eyesHe was dead Grief threatened to overwhelm Kaladin No said the part of his mind trained by his father Save the ones you can He turned to Cenn The boy had taken a hoof to the chest cracking his sternum and shattering ribs The boy gasped eyes upward struggling for breath Kaladin pulled out a bandage Then he paused looking at it A bandage To mend a smashed chest Cenn stopped wheezing He convulsed once eyes still open He watches the boy hissed The black piper in the night He holds us in his palmplaying a tune that no man can hear Cenns eyes glazed over He stopped breathing Lyndels face had been smashed in Cyns eyes smoldered and he wasnt breathing either Kaladin knelt in Cenns blood horrified as Toorim and the two subsquads formed around him looking as stunned as Kaladin felt This isnt possible II Screaming Kaladin looked up Amarams banner of green and burgundy flew just to the south The Shardbearer had cut through Kaladins squad heading straight for that banner Spearmen fled in disarray screaming scattering before the Shardbearer Anger boiled inside of Kaladin Sir Toorim asked Kaladin picked up his spear and stood His knees were covered with Cenns blood His men regarded him confused worried They stood firm in the midst of the chaos as far as Kaladin could tell they were the only men who werent fleeing The Shardbearer had turned the ranks to mush Kaladin thrust his spear into the air then began to run His men bellowed a war cry falling into formation behind him charging across the flat rocky ground Spearmen in uniforms of both colors scrambled out of the way dropping spears and shields Kaladin picked up speed legs pumping his squad barely keeping pace Just aheadright before the Shardbearera pocket of green broke and ran Amarams honor guard Faced by a Shardbearer they abandoned their charge Amaram himself was a solitary man on a rearing horse He wore silvery plate armor that looked so commonplace when compared with the Shardplate Kaladins squad charged against the flow of the army a wedge of soldiers going the wrong way The only ones going the wrong way Some of the fleeing men paused as he charged past but none joined Ahead the Shardbearer rode past Amaram With a sweep of the Blade the Shardbearer slashed through the neck of Amarams mount Its eyes burned into two great pits and it toppled jerking fitfully Amaram still in its saddle The Shardbearer wheeled his destrier in a tight circle then threw himself from horseback at full speed He hit the ground with a grinding sound somehow remaining upright and skidding to a halt Kaladin redoubled his speed Was he running to get vengeance or was he trying to protect his highmarshal The only lighteyes who had ever shown a modicum of humanity Did it matter Amaram struggled in his bulky plate the carcass of the horse on his leg The Shardbearer raised his Blade in two hands to finish him off Coming at the Shardbearer from behind Kaladin screamed and swung low with the butt of his spear putting momentum and muscle behind the blow The spear haft shattered against the Shardbearers back leg in a spray of wooden slivers The jolt of it knocked Kaladin to the ground his arms shaking the broken spear clutched in his hands The Shardbearer stumbled lowering his Blade He turned a helmed face toward Kaladin posture indicating utter surprise The twenty remaining men of Kaladins squad arrived a heartbeat later attacking vigorously Kaladin scrambled to his feet and ran for the spear from a fallen soldier He tossed his broken one away after snatching one of his knives from its sheath snatched the new one off the ground then turned back to see his men attacking as he had taught They came at the foe from three directions ramming spears between joints in the Plate The Shardbearer glanced around as a bemused man might regard a pack of puppies yapping around him Not a single one of the spear thrusts appeared to pierce his armor He shook a helmed head Then he struck The Shardblade swept out in a broad sweeping series of deadly strokes cutting through ten of the spearmen Kaladin was paralyzed in horror as Toorim Acis Hamel and seven others fell to the ground eyes burning their armor and weapons sheared completely through The remaining spearmen stumbled back aghast The Shardbearer attacked again killing Raksha Navar and four others Kaladin gaped His menhis friendsdead just like that The last four scrambled away Hab stumbling over Toorims corpse and falling to the ground dropping his spear The Shardbearer ignored them stepping up to the pinned Amaram again No Kaladin thought No no NO Something drove him forward against all logic against all sense Sickened agonized enraged The hollow where they fought was empty save for them Sensible spearmen had fled His four remaining men achieved the ridge a short distance away but didnt run They called for him Kaladin Reesh yelled Kaladin no Kaladin screamed instead The Shardbearer saw him and spunimpossibly quickswinging Kaladin ducked under the blow and rammed the butt of his spear against the Shardbearers knee It bounced off Kaladin cursed throwing himself backward just as the Blade sliced the air in front of him Kaladin rebounded and lunged forward He made an expert thrust at his enemys neck The neck brace rebuffed the attack Kaladins spear barely scratched the Plates paint The Shardbearer turned on him holding his Blade in a twohanded grip Kaladin dashed past just out of range of that incredible sword Amaram had finally pulled himself free and he was crawling away one leg dragging behind himmultiple fractures from the twist of it Kaladin skidded to a stop spinning regarding the Shardbearer This creature wasnt a god It was everything the most petty of lighteyes represented The ability to kill people like Kaladin with impunity Every suit of armor had a chink Every man had a flaw Kaladin thought he saw the mans eyes through the helms slit That slit was just big enough for a dagger but the throw would have to be perfect Hed have to be close Deadly close Kaladin charged forward again The Shardbearer swung his Blade out in the same wide sweep hed used to kill so many of Kaladins men Kaladin threw himself downward skidding on his knees and bending backward The Shardblade flashed above him shearing the top of his spear free The tip flipped up into the air tumbling end over end Kaladin strained hurling himself back onto his feet He whipped his hand up flinging his knife at the eyes watching from behind impervious armor The dagger hit the faceplate just slightly off from the right angle bouncing against the sides of the slit and ricocheting out The Shardbearer cursed swinging his huge Blade back at Kaladin Kaladin landed on his feet momentum still propelling him forward Something flashed in the air beside him falling toward the ground The spearhead Kaladin bellowed in defiance spinning snatching the spearhead from the air It had been falling tipdown and he caught it by the four inches of haft that remained gripping it with his thumb on the stump the sharp point extending down beneath his hand The Shardbearer brought his weapon around as Kaladin skidded to a stop and flung his arm to the side slamming the spearhead right in the Shardbearers visor slit All fell still Kaladin stood with his arm extended the Shardbearer standing just to his right Amaram had pulled himself halfway up the side of the shallow hollow Kaladins spearmates stood on the edge of the scene gawking Kaladin stood there gasping still gripping the haft of the spear hand before the Shardbearers face The Shardbearer creaked then fell backward crashing to the ground His Blade dropped from his fingers hitting the ground at an angle and digging into the stone Kaladin stumbled away feeling drained Stunned Numbed His men rushed up halting in a group staring at the fallen man They were amazed even a little reverent Is he dead Alabet asked softly He is a voice said from the side Kaladin turned Amaram still lay on the ground but he had pulled off his helm dark hair and beard slicked with sweat If he were still alive his Blade would have vanished His armor is falling off of him He is dead Blood of my ancestorsyou killed a Shardbearer Oddly Kaladin wasnt surprised Just exhausted He looked around at the bodies of men who had been his dearest friends Take it Kaladin Coreb said Kaladin turned looking at the Shardblade which sprouted at an angle into the stone hilt toward the sky Take it Coreb said again Its yours Stormfather Kaladin Youre a Shardbearer Kaladin stepped forward dazed raising his hand toward the hilt of the Blade He hesitated just an inch away from it Everything felt wrong If he took that Blade hed become one of them His eyes would even change if the stories were right Though the Blade glistened in the light clean of the murders it had performed for a moment it seemed red to him Stained with Dallets blood Toorims blood The blood of the men who had been alive just moments before It was a treasure Men traded kingdoms for Shardblades The handful of darkeyed men who had won them lived forever in song and story But the thought of touching that Blade sickened him It represented everything hed come to hate about the lighteyes and it had just slaughtered men he loved dearly He could not become a legend because of something like that He looked at his reflection in the Blades pitiless metal then lowered his hand and turned away Its yours Coreb Kaladin said I give it to you What Coreb said from behind Ahead Amarams honor guard had finally returned apprehensively appearing at the top of the small hollow looking ashamed What are you doing Amaram demanded as Kaladin passed him WhatArent you going to take the Blade I dont want it Kaladin said softly Im giving it to my men Kaladin walked away emotionally exhausted tears on his cheeks as he climbed out of the hollow and shoved his way through the honor guard He walked back to the warcamp alone They take away the light wherever they lurk Skin that is burned Cormshen page 104 Shallan sat quietly propped up in a sterile whitesheeted bed in one of Kharbranths many hospitals Her arm was wrapped in a neat crisp bandage and she held her drawing board in front of her The nurses had reluctantly allowed her to sketch so long as she did not stress herself Her arm ached shed sliced herself more deeply than shed intended Shed hoped to simulate a wound from breaking the pitcher she hadnt thought far enough ahead to realize how much like a suicide attempt it might seem Though shed protested that shed simply fallen from bed she could see that the nurses and ardents didnt accept it She couldnt blame them The results were embarrassing but at least nobody thought she might have Soulcast to make that blood Embarrassment was worth escaping suspicion She continued her sketch She was in a large hallwaylike room in a Kharbranthian hospital the walls lined with many beds Other than obvious aggravations her two days in the hospital had gone fairly well Shed had a lot of time to think about that strangest of afternoons when shed seen ghosts transformed glass to blood and had an ardent offer to resign the ardentia to be with her Shed done several drawings of this hospital room The creatures lurked in her sketches staying at the distant edges of the room Their presence made it difficult for her to sleep but she was slowly growing accustomed to them The air smelled of soap and listers oil she was bathed regularly and her arm washed with antiseptic to frighten away rotspren About half of the beds held sick women and there were wheeled fabric dividers with wooden frames that could be rolled around a bed for privacy Shallan wore a plain white robe that untied at the front and had a long left sleeve that tied shut to protect her safehand Shed transferred her safepouch to the robe buttoning it inside the left sleeve Nobody had looked in the pouch When shed been washed theyd unbuttoned it and given it to her without a word despite its unusual weight One did not look in a womans safepouch Still she kept hold of it whenever she could In the hospital her every need was seen to but she could not leave It reminded her of being at home on her fathers estates More and more that frightened her as much as the symbolheads did Shed tasted independence and she didnt want to go back to what she had been Coddled pampered displayed Unfortunately it was unlikely shed be able to return to studying with Jasnah Her supposed suicide attempt gave her an excellent reason to return home She had to go To remain sending the Soulcaster away on its own would be selfish considering this opportunity to leave without arousing suspicion Besides shed used the Soulcaster She could use the long trip home to figure out how shed done it then be ready to help her family when she arrived She sighed and then with a few shadings she finished her sketch It was a picture of that strange place she had gone That distant horizon with its powerful yet cold sun Clouds running toward it above endless ocean below making the sun look as if it were at the end of a long tunnel Above the ocean hovered hundreds of flames a sea of lights above the sea of glass beads She lifted the picture up looking at the sketch underneath It depicted her huddled on her bed surrounded by the strange creatures She didnt dare tell Jasnah what she had seen lest it reveal that she had Soulcast and therefore committed the theft The next picture was one of her lying on the ground amid the blood She looked up from the sketchpad A whiteclothed female ardent sat against the wall nearby pretending to sew but really keeping watch in case Shallan decided to harm herself again Shallan made a thin line of her lips Its a good cover she told herself It works perfectly Stop being so embarrassed She turned to the last of her days sketches It depicted one of the symbolheads No eyes no face just that jagged alien symbol with points like cut crystal They had to have something to do with the Soulcasting Didnt they I visited another place she thought I thinkI think I spoke with the spirit of the goblet Did a goblet of all things have a soul Upon opening her pouch to check on the Soulcaster shed found that the sphere Kabsal had given her had stopped glowing She could remember a vague feeling of light and beauty a raging storm inside of her Shed taken the light from the sphere and given it to the gobletthe spren of the gobletas a bribe to transform Was that how Soulcasting worked Or was she just struggling to make connections Shallan lowered the sketchpad as visitors entered the room and began moving among the patients Most of the women sat up excitedly as they saw King Taravangian with his orange robes and kindly aged air He paused at each bed to chat Shed heard that he visited frequently at least once a week Eventually he reached Shallans bedside He smiled at her sitting as one of his many attendants placed a padded stool for him And young Shallan Davar I was so terribly saddened to hear of your accident I apologize for not coming earlier Duties of state kept me It is quite all right Your Majesty No no it is not he said But it is what must be There are many who complain that I spend too much of my time here Shallan smiled Those complaints were never vociferous The landlords and house lords who played politics in court were quite content with a king who spent so much of his time outside the palace ignoring their schemes This hospital is amazing Your Majesty she said I cant believe how well everyone is cared for He smiled widely My great triumph Lighteyes and darkeyes alike nobody turned awaynot beggar not whore not sailor from afar Its all paid for by the Palanaeum you know In a way even the most obscure and useless record is helping heal the sick Im glad to be here I doubt that child A hospital such as this one is perhaps the only thing a man could pour so much money into and be delighted if it were never used It is a tragedy that you must become my guest What I meant was that Id rather be sick here than somewhere else Though I suppose thats a little like saying its better to choke on wine than on dishwater He laughed What a sweet thing you are he said rising Is there anything I can do to improve your stay End it Im afraid that I cant allow that he said eyes softening I must defer to the wisdom of my surgeons and nurses They say that you are still at risk We must think of your health Keeping me here gives me health at the expense of my wellness Your Majesty He shook his head You mustnt be allowed to have another accident II understand But I promise that Im feeling much better The episode that struck me was caused by overwork Now that Im relaxed Im not in any further danger That is good he said But we still need to keep you for a few more days Yes Your Majesty But could I at least have visitors So far the hospital staff had insisted that she was not to be bothered YesI can see how that might help you Ill speak to the ardents and suggest that you be allowed a few visitors He hesitated Once you are well again it might be best for you to suspend your training She pasted a grimace on her face trying not to feel sick at the charade I hate to do that Your Majesty But I have been missing my family greatly Perhaps I should return to them An excellent idea Im certain the ardents will be more likely to release you if they know youll be going home He smiled in a kindly way resting a hand on her shoulder This world it is a tempest sometimes But remember the sun always rises again Thank you Your Majesty The king moved away visiting other patients then speaking quietly with the ardents Not five minutes passed before Jasnah walked through the doorway with her characteristic straightbacked stride She wore a beautiful dress deep blue with golden embroidery Her sleek black hair was done in braids and pierced by six thin golden spikes her cheeks glowed with blush her lips bloodred with lip paint She stood out in the white room like a flower upon a field of barren stone She glided toward Shallan on feet hidden beneath the loose folds of her silk skirt carrying a thick book under her arm An ardent brought her a stool and she sat down where the king had just stood Jasnah regarded Shallan face stiff impassive I have been told that my tutelage is demanding perhaps harsh This is one reason why I often refuse to take wards I apologize for my weakness Brightness Shallan said looking down Jasnah seemed displeased I did not mean to suggest fault in you child I was attempting the opposite Unfortunately Imunaccustomed to such behavior Apologizing Yes Well you see Shallan said in order to grow proficient at apologizing you must first make mistakes Thats your problem Jasnah Youre absolutely terrible at making them The womans expression softened The king mentioned to me that you would be returning to your family What When When he met me in the hallway outside she said and finally gave me permission to visit you You make it sound as if you were waiting out there Jasnah didnt reply But your research Can be done in the hospital waiting chamber She hesitated It has been somewhat difficult for me to focus these last few days Jasnah Thats quite nearly human of you Jasnah regarded her reprovingly and Shallan winced immediately regretting the words Im sorry Ive learned poorly havent I Or perhaps you are just practicing the art of the apology So that you will not be unsettled when the need arises as I am How very clever of me Indeed Can I stop now then Shallan asked I think Ive had quite enough practice I should think Jasnah said that apology is an art of which we could use a few more masters Do not use me as a model in this Pride is often mistaken for faultlessness She leaned forward I am sorry Shallan Davar In overworking you I may have done the world a disservice and stolen from it one of the great scholars of the rising generation Shallan blushed feeling more foolish and guilty Shallans eyes flickered to her mistresss hand Jasnah wore the black glove that hid the fake In the fingers of her safehand Shallan grasped the pouch holding the Soulcaster If Jasnah only knew Jasnah took the book from beneath her arm and set it on the bed beside Shallan This is for you Shallan picked it up She opened to the front page but it was blank The next one was as well as were all inside of it Her frown deepened and she looked up at Jasnah Its called the Book of Endless Pages Jasnah said Er Im pretty sure its not endless Brightness She flipped to the last page and held it up Jasnah smiled Its a metaphor Shallan Many years ago someone dear to me made a very good attempt at converting me to Vorinism This was the method he used Shallan cocked her head You search for truth Jasnah said but you also hold to your faith There is much to admire in that Seek out the Devotary of Sincerity They are one of the very smallest of the devotaries but this book is their guide One with blank pages Indeed They worship the Almighty but are guided by the belief that there are always more answers to be found The book can not be filled as there is always something to learn This devotary is a place where one is never penalized for questions even those challenging Vorinisms own tenets She shook her head I can not explain their ways You should be able to find them in Vedenar though there are none in Kharbranth I Shallan trailed off noticing how Jasnahs hand rested fondly on the book It was precious to her I hadnt thought to find ardents who were willing to question their own beliefs Jasnah raised an eyebrow You will find wise men in any religion Shallan and good men in every nation Those who truly seek wisdom are those who will acknowledge the virtue in their adversaries and who will learn from those who disabuse them of error All othersheretic Vorin Ysperist or Maakianare equally closedminded She took her hand from the book moving as if to stand up Hes wrong Shallan said suddenly realizing something Jasnah turned to her Kabsal Shallan said blushing He says youre researching the Voidbringers because you want to prove that Vorinism is false Jasnah sniffed in derision I would not dedicate four years of my life to such an empty pursuit Its idiocy to try to prove a negative Let the Vorin believe as they wishthe wise among them will find goodness and solace in their faith the fools would be fools no matter what they believed Shallan frowned So why was Jasnah studying the Voidbringers Ah Speak of the storm and it begins to bluster Jasnah said turning toward the rooms entrance With a start Shallan realized that Kabsal had just arrived wearing his usual grey robes He was arguing softly with a nurse who pointed at the basket he carried Finally the nurse threw up her hands and walked away leaving Kabsal to approach triumphant Finally he said to Shallan Old Mungam can be a real tyrant Mungam Shallan asked The ardent who runs this place Kabsal said I should have been allowed in immediately After all I know what you need to make you better He pulled out a jar of jam smiling broadly Jasnah remained on her stool regarding Kabsal across the bed I would have thought she said dryly that you would allow Shallan a respite considering how your attentions drove her to despair Kabsal flushed He looked at Shallan and she could see the pleading in his eyes It wasnt you Kabsal Shallan said I justI wasnt ready for life away from my family estate I still dont know what came over me Ive never done anything like that before He smiled pulling a stool over for himself I think he said that the lack of color in these places is what keeps people sick so long That and the lack of proper food He winked turning the jar toward Shallan It was deep dark red Strawberry Never heard of it Shallan said Its exceedingly rare Jasnah said reaching for the jar Like most plants from Shinovar it cant grow other places Kabsal looked surprised as Jasnah removed the lid and dipped a finger into the jar She hesitated then raised a bit of the jam to her nose to sniff at it I was under the impression that you disliked jam Brightness Jasnah Kabsal said I do she said I was simply curious about the scent Ive heard that strawberries are very distinctive She screwed the lid back on then wiped her finger on her cloth handkerchief I brought bread as well Kabsal said He pulled out a small loaf of the fluffy bread Its nice of you not to blame me Shallan but I can see that my attentions were too forward I thought maybe I could bring this and And what Jasnah asked Absolve yourself Im sorry I drove you to suicide Heres some bread He blushed looking down Of course Ill have some Shallan said glaring at Jasnah And she will too It was very kind of you Kabsal She took the bread breaking off a chunk for Kabsal one for herself then one for Jasnah No Jasnah said Thank you Jasnah Shallan said Would you please at least try some It bothered her that the two of them got on so poorly The older woman sighed Oh very well She took the bread holding it as Shallan and Kabsal ate The bread was moist and delicious though Jasnah grimaced as she put hers in her mouth and chewed it You should really try the jam Kabsal said to Shallan Strawberry is hard to find I had to make quite a number of inquiries No doubt bribing merchants with the kings money Jasnah noted Kabsal sighed Brightness Jasnah I realize that you are not fond of me But Im working very hard to be pleasant Could you at least pretend to do likewise Jasnah eyed Shallan probably recalling Kabsals guess that undermining Vorinism was the goal of her research She didnt apologize but also made no retort Good enough Shallan thought The jam Shallan Kabsal said handing her a slice of bread for it Oh right She removed the lid of the jar holding it between her knees and using her freehand You missed your ship out I assume Kabsal said Yes Whats this Jasnah asked Shallan cringed I was planning to leave Brightness Im sorry I should have told you Jasnah settled back I suppose it was to be expected all things considered The jam Kabsal prodded again Shallan frowned He was particularly insistent about that jam She raised the jar and sniffed at it then pulled back It smells terrible This is jam It smelled like vinegar and slime What Kabsal said alarmed He took the jar sniffing at it then pulled away looking nauseated It appears you got a bad jar Jasnah said Thats not how its supposed to smell Not at all Kabsal said He hesitated then stuck his finger into the jam anyway shoving a large glob into his mouth Kabsal Shallan said Thats revolting He coughed but forced it down Not so bad really You should try it What Really he said forcing it toward her I mean I wanted this to be special for you And it turned out so horribly Im not tasting that Kabsal He hesitated as if considering forcing it upon her Why was he acting so strangely He raised a hand to his head stood up and stumbled away from the bed Then he began to rush from the room He made it only halfway before crashing to the floor his body sliding a little way across the spotless stone Kabsal Shallan said leaping out of the bed hurrying to his side wearing only the white robe He was shaking Andand And so was she The room was spinning Suddenly she felt very very tired She tried to stand but slipped dizzy She barely felt herself hit the floor Someone was kneeling above her cursing Jasnah Her voice was distant Shes been poisoned I need a garnet Bring me a garnet Theres one in my pouch Shallan thought She fumbled with it managing to undo the tie of her safehands sleeve Whywhy does she want But no I cant show her that The Soulcaster Her mind was so fuzzy Shallan Jasnahs voice said anxious very soft Im going to have to Soulcast your blood to purify it It will be dangerous Extremely dangerous Im not good with flesh or blood Its not where my talent lies She needs it To save me Weakly she reached in and pulled out her safepouch with her right hand Youcant Hush child Where is that garnet You cant Soulcast Shallan said weakly pulling the ties of her pouch open She upended it vaguely seeing a fuzzy golden object slip out onto the floor alongside the garnet that Kabsal had given her Stormfather Why was the room spinning so much Jasnah gasped Distantly Fading Something happened A flash of warmth burned through Shallan something inside her skin as if she had been dumped into a steaming hot cauldron She screamed arching her back her muscles spasming All went black Radiant of birthplace the announcer comes to come announce the birthplace of Radiants Though I am not overly fond of the ketek poetic form as a means of conveying information this one by Allahn is often quoted in reference to Urithiru I believe some mistook the home of the Radiants for their birthplace The towering walls of the chasm rising on either side of Kaladin dripped with greenish grey moss His torchs flames danced light reflecting on slick rainwetted sections of stone The humid air was chilly and the highstorm had left puddles and ponds Spindly bonesan ulna and a radiuspoked from a deep puddle Kaladin passed He didnt look to see if the rest of the skeleton was there Flash floods Kaladin thought listening to the scraping steps of the bridgemen behind him That water has to go somewhere otherwise wed have canals to cross instead of chasms Kaladin didnt know if he could trust his dream or not but hed asked around and it was true that the eastern edge of the Shattered Plains was more open than the western side The plateaus had been worn away If the bridgemen could get there they might be able to flee to the east Might Many chasmfiends lived in that area and Alethi scouts patrolled the perimeter beyond If Kaladins team met them they would have trouble explaining what a group of armed menmany with slave brandswas doing there Syl walked along the wall of the chasm about level with Kaladins head Groundspren didnt pull her downward as they did everything else She walked with her hands clasped behind her back her tiny kneelength skirt fluttering in an intangible wind Escape to the east It seemed unlikely The highprinces had tried very hard to explore that way looking for a route to the center of the Plains Theyd failed Chasmfiends had killed some groups Others had been caught in the chasms during highstorms despite precautions It was impossible to predict the storms perfectly Other scouting parties had avoided those two fates Theyd used enormous extensible ladders to climb atop plateaus during highstorms Theyd lost many men though as the plateau tops provided poor cover during storms and you couldnt bring wagons or other shelter with you into the chasms The bigger problem hed heard had been the Parshendi patrols Theyd found and killed dozens of scouting parties Kaladin Teft asked hustling up splashing through a puddle where bits of empty cremling carapace floated You all right Fine You look thoughtful More breakfastfull Kaladin said That gruel was particularly dense this morning Teft smiled I never took you for the glib type I used to be more so I get it from my mother You could rarely say anything to her without getting it twisted about and tossed back to you Teft nodded They walked in silence for a time the bridgemen behind laughing as Dunny told a story about the first girl hed ever kissed Son Teft said have you felt anything strange lately Strange What kind of strange I dont know Justanything odd He coughed You know like odd surges of strength Theer feeling that youre light The feeling that Im what Light Er maybe like your head is light Lightheaded That sort of thing Storm it boy Im just checking to see if youre still sick You were beat up pretty badly by that highstorm Im fine Kaladin said Remarkably so actually Odd eh It was odd It fed his nagging worry that he was subject to some kind of supernatural curse of the type that were supposed to happen to people who sought the Old Magic There were stories of evil men made immortal then tortured over and over againlike Extes who had his arms torn off each day for sacrificing his son to the Voidbringers in exchange for knowledge of the day of his death It was just a tale but tales came from somewhere Kaladin lived when everyone else died Was that the work of some spren from Damnation toying with him like a windspren but infinitely more nefarious Letting him think that he might be able to do some good then killing everyone he tried to help There were supposed to be thousands of kinds of spren many that people never saw or didnt know about Syl followed him Could some kind of evil spren be doing the same A very disturbing thought Superstition is useless he told himself forcefully Think on it too much and youll end up like Durk insisting that you need to wear your lucky boots into every battle They reached a section where the chasm forked splitting around a plateau high above Kaladin turned to face the bridgemen This is as good a place as any The bridgemen stopped bunching up He could see the anticipation in their eyes the excitement Hed felt that once back before hed known the soreness and the pain of practice Oddly Kaladin felt he was now both more in awe of and more disappointed in the spear than hed been as a youth He loved the focus the feeling of certainty that he felt when he fought But that hadnt saved those who followed him This is where Im supposed to tell you what a sorry group you are Kaladin said to the men Its the way Ive always seen it done The training sergeant tells the recruits that they are pathetic He points out their weakness perhaps spars with a few of them tossing them on their backsides to teach them humility I did that a few times myself when training new spearmen Kaladin shook his head Today thats not how well begin You men dont need humbling You dont dream of glory You dream of survival Most of all you arent the sad unprepared group of recruits most sergeants have to deal with Youre tough Ive seen you run for miles carrying a bridge Youre brave Ive seen you charge straight at a line of archers Youre determined Otherwise you wouldnt be here right now with me Kaladin walked to the side of the chasm and extracted a discarded spear from some floodstrewn rubble Once he had it however he realized that the spearhead had been knocked off He almost tossed it aside then reconsidered Spears were dangerous for him to hold They made him want to fight and might lead him to think he was who hed once been Kaladin Stormblessed confident squadleader He wasnt that man any longer It seemed that whenever he picked up weapons the people around him diedfriends as well as foes So for now it seemed good to hold this length of wood it was just a staff Nothing more A stick he could use for training He could face returning to the spear another time Its good that youre already prepared Kaladin said to the men Because we dont have the six weeks I was given to train a new batch of recruits In six weeks Sadeas will have half of us dead I intend to see you all drinking mudbeer in a tavern somewhere safe by the time six weeks have passed Several of them gave a kind of halfcheer at that Well have to be fast Kaladin said Ill have to push you hard Thats our only option He glanced at the spear haft The first thing you need to learn is that its all right to care The twentythree bridgemen stood in a double row All had wanted to come Even Leyten who had been hurt so badly They didnt have any who were wounded so badly they couldnt walk although Dabbid continued to stare off at nothing Rock stood with his arms folded apparently with no intention of learning to fight Shen the parshman stood at the very back He looked at the ground Kaladin didnt intend to put a spear in his hands Several of the bridgemen seemed confused by what Kaladin had said about emotions though Teft just raised an eyebrow and Moash yawned What do you mean Drehy asked He was a lanky blond man longlimbed and muscled He spoke with a faint accent he was from somewhere far to the west called Rianal A lot of soldiers Kaladin said running his thumb across the pole feeling the grain of the wood they think that you fight the best if youre passionless and cold I think thats stormleavings Yes you need to be focused Yes emotions are dangerous But if you dont care about anything what are you An animal driven only to kill Our passion is what makes us human We have to fight for a reason So I say that its all right to care Well talk about controlling your fear and anger but remember this as the first lesson I taught you Several of the bridgemen nodded Most seemed confused still Kaladin remembered being there wondering why Tukks wasted time talking about emotions Hed thought he understood emotionhis drive to learn the spear had come because of his emotions Vengeance Hatred A lust for the power to exact retribution on Varth and the soldiers of his squad He looked up trying to banish those memories No the bridgemen didnt understand his words about caring but perhaps they would remember later as Kaladin had The second lesson Kaladin said slapping the decapitated spear to the rock beside him with a crack that echoed down the chasm is more utilitarian Before you can learn to fight youre going to have to learn how to stand He dropped the spear The bridgemen watched him with frowns of disappointment Kaladin fell into a basic spearmans stance feet wide apartbut not too wideturned sideways knees bent in a loose crouch Skar I want you to come try to push me backward What Try and throw me off balance Kaladin said Force me to stumble Skar shrugged and walked forward He tried to shove Kaladin back but Kaladin easily knocked his hands aside with a quick snap of the wrist Skar cursed and came at him again but Kaladin caught his arm and shoved him backward causing Skar to stumble Drehy come help him Kaladin said Moash you too Try to force me off balance The other two joined Skar Kaladin stepped around the attacks staying squarely in the middle of them adjusting his stance to rebuff each attempt He grabbed Drehys arm and yanked him forward nearly causing him to fall He stepped into Skars shoulderrush deflecting the weight of the mans body and throwing him backward He pulled back as Moash got his arms on him causing Moash to overbalance himself Kaladin remained completely unfazed weaving between them and adjusting his center of balance by bending his knees and positioning his feet Combat begins with the legs Kaladin said as he evaded the attacks I dont care how fast you are with a jab how accurate you are with a thrust If your opponent can trip you or make you stumble youll lose Losing means dying Several of the watching bridgemen tried to imitate Kaladin crouching down Skar Drehy and Moash had finally decided to try a coordinated rush planning to all tackle Kaladin at once Kaladin held up his hand Well done you three He motioned them back to stand with the others They reluctantly broke off their attacks Im going to split you into pairs Kaladin said Were going to spend all day todayand probably each day this weekworking on stances Learning to maintain one learning to not lock your knees the moment youre threatened learning to hold your center of balance It will take time but I promise you if we start here youll learn to be deadly far more quickly Even if it seems that all youre doing at first is standing around The men nodded Teft Kaladin ordered Split them into pairs by size and weight then run them through an elementary forward spear stance Aye sir Teft barked Then he froze realizing what hed given away The speed at which hed responded made it obvious that Teft had been a soldier Teft met Kaladins eyes and saw that Kaladin knew The older man scowled but Kaladin returned a grin He had a veteran under his command that was going to make this all a lot easier Teft didnt feign ignorance and easily fell into the role of the training sergeant splitting the men into pairs correcting their stances No wonder he never takes off that shirt Kaladin thought It probably hides a mess of scars As Teft instructed the men Kaladin pointed to Rock gesturing him over Yes Rock asked The man was so broad of chest that his bridgemans vest could barely fasten You said something before Kaladin said About fighting being beneath you Is true I am not a fourth son What does that have to do with it First son and second son are needed for making food Rock said raising a finger Is most important Without food nobody lives yes Third son is craftsman This is me I serve proudly Only fourth son can be warrior Warriors they are not needed as much as food or crafts You see Your profession is determined by your birth order Yes Rock said proudly Is best way On the Peaks there is always food Not every family has four sons So not always is a soldier needed I can not fight What man could do this thing before the Ulitekanaki Kaladin shot a glance at Syl She shrugged not seeming to care what Rock did All right he said Ive got something else I want you to do then Go grab Lopen Dabbid Kaladin hesitated And Shen Get him too Rock did so Lopen was in the line learning the stances though Dabbidas usualstood off to the side staring at nothing in particular Whatever had taken him it was far worse than regular battle shock Shen stood beside him hesitant as if not certain of his place Rock pulled Lopen out of the line then grabbed Dabbid and Shen and walked back to Kaladin Gancho Lopen said with a lazy salute Guess Ill make a poor spearman with one hand Thats all right Kaladin said I have something else I need you to do Well see trouble from Gaz and our new captainor at least his wifeif we dont bring back salvage We three can not do the work of thirty Kaladin Rock said scratching at his beard Is not possible Maybe not Kaladin said But most of our time down in these chasms is spent looking for corpses that havent been picked clean I think we can work a lot faster We need to work a lot faster if were going to train with the spear Fortunately we have an advantage He held out his hand and Syl alighted on it Hed spoken to her earlier and shed agreed to his plan He didnt notice her doing anything special but Lopen suddenly gasped Syl had made herself visible to him Ah Rock said bowing in respect to Syl Like gathering reeds Well flick my sparks Lopen said Rock you never said it was so pretty Syl smiled broadly Be respectful Rock said Is not for you to speak of her in that way little person The men knew about Syl of course Kaladin didnt speak of her but they saw him talking to the air and Rock had explained Lopen Kaladin said Syl can move far more quickly than a bridgeman She will search out places for you to gather and you four can pick through things quickly Dangerous Rock said What if we meet chasmfiend while alone Unfortunately we cant come back emptyhanded The last thing we want is Hashal deciding to send Gaz down to supervise Lopen snorted Hed never do that gancho Too much work down here Too dangerous too Rock added Everyone says that Kaladin said But Ive never seen more than these scrapes on the walls Theyre down here Rock said Is not just legend Just before you came half a bridge crew was killed Eaten Most beasts come to the middle plateaus but there are some who come this far Well I hate to put you in danger but unless we try this well have chasm duty taken from us and well end up cleaning latrines instead All right gancho Lopen said Ill go As will I Rock said With aliikamura to protect perhaps it will be safe I intend to teach you to fight eventually Kaladin said Then as Rock frowned Kaladin hastily added You Lopen I mean One arm doesnt mean youre useless Youll be at a disadvantage but there are things I can teach you to deal with that Right now a scavenger is more important to us than another spear Sounds swift to me Lopen gestured to Dabbid and the two walked over to gather sacks for the collecting Rock moved to join them but Kaladin took his arm I havent given up on finding an easier way out of here than fighting Kaladin said to him If we never returned Gaz and the others would probably just assume that a chasmfiend got us If theres some way to reach the other side Rock looked skeptical Many have searched for this thing The eastern edge is open Yes Rock said laughing and when you are able to travel that far without being eaten by chasmfiend or killed in floods I shall name you my kalukiiki Kaladin raised an eyebrow Only a woman can be kalukiiki Rock said as if that explained the joke Wife Rock laughed even louder No no Airsick lowlanders Ha Great Look see if you can memorize the chasms perhaps make a map of some kind I suspect that most who come down here stick to the established routes That means were much more likely to find salvage down side passages thats where Ill be sending Syl Side passages Rock said still amused One might begin to think you want me to be eaten Ha and by a greatshell They are supposed to be tasted not tasting I No no Rock said Is a good plan I only jest I can be careful and this will be good for me to do since I do not wish to fight Thank you Maybe youll happen upon a place we could climb out I will do this thing Rock said nodding But we can not simply climb out The army has many scouts on the Plains Is how they know when chasmfiends come to pupate eh They will see us and we will not be able to cross chasms without bridge It was a good argument unfortunately Climb up here and theyd be seen Climb out in the middle and theyd be stuck on plateaus without anywhere to go Climb out closer to the Parshendi areas and theyd be found by their scouts That was assuming they could get out of the chasms Though some were as shallow as forty or fifty feet many were well over a hundred feet deep Syl zipped away to lead Rock and his crew and Kaladin moved back to the main body of bridgemen to help Teft correct stances It was difficult work the first day always was The bridgemen were sloppy and uncertain But they also showed remarkable resolve Kaladin had never worked with a group who made fewer complaints The bridgemen didnt ask for a break They didnt shoot him resentful glances when he pushed them harder The scowls they bore were at their own foibles angry at themselves for not learning faster And they got it After just a few hours the more talented of themMoash at the forefrontstarted to change into fighting men Their stances grew firmer more confident When they should have been feeling exhausted and frustrated they were more determined Kaladin stepped back watching Moash fall into his stance after Teft shoved him It was a resetting exerciseMoash would let Teft knock him backward then would scramble back and set his feet Time and time again The purpose was to train oneself to revert to the stance without thinking Kaladin normally wouldnt have started resetting exercises until the second or third day Yet here Moash was drinking it in after only two hours There were two othersDrehy and Skarwho were nearly as quick to learn Kaladin leaned back against the stone wall Cold water leaked down the rock beside him and a frillbloom plant hesitantly opened its fanlike fronds beside his head two wide orange leaves with spines on the tips unfolding like opening fists Is it their bridgeman training Kaladin wondered Or is it their passion He had given them a chance to fight back That kind of opportunity changed a man Watching them stand resolute and capable in stances they had only been just been taught Kaladin realized something These mencast off by the army forced to work themselves near to death then fed extra food by Kaladins careful planningwere the most fit trainingready recruits hed ever been given By seeking to beat them down Sadeas had prepared them to excel Flame and char Skin so terrible Eyes like pits of blackness A quote from the Iviad probably needs no reference notation but this comes from line 482 should I need to locate it quickly Shallan awoke in a small white room She sat up feeling oddly healthy Bright sunlight illuminated the windows gossamer white shades bursting through the cloth and into the room Shallan frowned shaking her muddled head She felt as if she should be burned toes to ears her skin flaking off But that was just a memory She had the cut on her arm but otherwise she felt perfectly well A rustling sound She turned to see a nurse hurrying away down a white hallway outside the woman had apparently seen Shallan sit up and was now taking the news to someone Im in the hospital Shallan thought Moved to a private room A soldier peeked in inspecting Shallan It was apparently a guarded room What happened she called to him I was poisoned wasnt I She felt a sudden shock of alarm Kabsal Is he all right The guard just turned back to his post Shallan began to crawl out of bed but he looked in again glaring at her She yelped despite herself pulling up the sheet and settling back She still wore one of the hospital robes much like a soft bathing robe How long had she been unconscious Why was she The Soulcaster she realized I gave it back to Jasnah The next half hour was one of the most miserable in Shallans life She spent it suffering the periodic glares of the guard and feeling nauseated What had happened Finally Jasnah appeared at the other end of the hallway She was wearing a different dress black with light grey piping She strode toward the room like an arrow and dismissed the guard with a single word as she passed The man hurried away his boots louder on the stone floor than Jasnahs slippers Jasnah came in and though she made no accusations her glare was so hostile that Shallan wanted to crawl under her covers and hide No She wanted to crawl under the bed dig down into the floor itself and put stone between herself and those eyes She settled for looking downward in shame You were wise to return the Soulcaster Jasnah said voice like ice It saved your life I saved your life Thank you Shallan whispered Who are you working with Which devotary bribed you to steal the fabrial None of them Brightness I stole it of my own volition Protecting them does you no good Eventually you will tell me the truth It is the truth Shallan said looking up feeling a hint of defiance Its why I became your ward in the first place To steal that Soulcaster Yes but for whom For me Shallan said Is it so hard to believe that I could act for myself Am I such a miserable failure that the only rational answer is to assume I was duped or manipulated You have no grounds to raise your voice to me child Jasnah said evenly And you have every reason to remember your place Shallan looked down again Jasnah was silent for a time Finally she sighed What were you thinking child My father is dead So He was not well liked Brightness Actually he was hated and our family is bankrupt My brothers are trying to put up a strong front by pretending he still lives But Dared she tell Jasnah that her father had possessed a Soulcaster Doing so wouldnt help excuse what Shallan had done and might get her family more deeply into trouble We needed something An edge A way to earn money quickly or create money Jasnah was silent again When she finally spoke she sounded faintly amused You thought your salvation lay in enraging not only all the entire ardentia but Alethkar Do you realize what my brother would have done if hed learned of this Shallan looked away feeling both foolish and ashamed Jasnah sighed Sometimes I forget how young you are I can see how the theft might have looked tempting to you It was stupid nonetheless Ive arranged passage back to Jah Keved You will leave in the morning I It was more than she deserved Thank you Your friend the ardent is dead Shallan looked up dismayed What happened The bread was poisoned Backbreaker powder Very lethal dusted over the bread to look like flour I suspect the bread was similarly treated every time he visited His goal was to get me to eat a piece But I ate a lot of that bread The jam had the antidote Jasnah said We found it in several empty jars hed used It cant be Ive begun investigating Jasnah said I should have done so immediately Nobody quite remembers where this Kabsal came from Though he spoke familiarly of the other ardents to you and me they knew him only vaguely Then he He was playing you child The whole time he was using you to get to me To spy on what I was doing to kill me if he could She spoke of it so evenly so emotionlessly I believe he used much more of the powder during this last attempt more than hed ever used before perhaps hoping to get me to breathe it in He realized this would be his last opportunity It turned against him however working more quickly than hed anticipated Someone had almost killed her Not someone Kabsal No wonder hed been so eager to get her to taste the jam Im very disappointed in you Shallan Jasnah said I can see now why you tried to end your own life It was the guilt She hadnt tried to kill herself But what good would it do to admit that Jasnah was taking pity on her best not to give her reason not to But what of the strange things Shallan had seen and experienced Might Jasnah have an explanation for them Looking at Jasnah seeing the cold rage hidden behind her calm exterior frightened Shallan enough that her questions about the symbolheads and the strange place shed visited died on her lips How had Shallan ever thought of herself as brave She wasnt brave She was a fool She remembered the times her fathers rage had echoed through the house Jasnahs quieter move justified anger was no less daunting Well you will need to learn to live with your guilt Jasnah said You might not have escaped with my fabrial but you have thrown away a very promising career This foolish scheme will stain your life for decades No woman will take you as a ward now You threw it away She shook her head in distaste I hate being wrong With that she turned to leave Shallan raised a hand I have to apologize I have to say something Jasnah The woman did not look back and the guard did not return Shallan curled up under the sheet stomach in knots feeling so sick thatfor a momentshe wished that shed actually dug that shard of glass in a little deeper Or maybe that Jasnah hadnt been quick enough with the Soulcaster to save her Shed lost it all No fabrial to protect her family no wardship to continue her studies No Kabsal Shed never actually had him in the first place Her tears dampened the sheets as the sunlight outside faded then vanished Nobody came to check on her Nobody cared ONE YEAR AGO Kaladin sat quietly in the waiting room of Amarams wooden warcenter It was constructed of a dozen study sections that could be disconnected and pulled by chulls Kaladin sat beside a window looking out at the camp There was a hole where Kaladins squad had been housed He could make it out from where he sat Their tents had been broken down and given to other squads Four of his men remained Four out of twentysix And men called him lucky Men called him Stormblessed Hed begun to believe that I killed a Shardbearer today he thought mind numb Like Lanacin the Surefooted or Evod Markmaker Me I killed one And he didnt care He crossed his arms on the wooden windowsill There was no glass in the window and he could feel the breeze A windspren flitted from one tent to another Behind Kaladin the room had a thick red rug and shields on the walls There were a number of padded wooden chairs like the one Kaladin sat in This was the small waiting chamber of the warcentersmall yet larger than his entire house back in Hearthstone the surgery included I killed a Shardbearer he thought again And then I gave away the Blade and Plate That single event had to be the most monumentally stupid thing anyone in any kingdom in any era had ever done As a Shardbearer Kaladin would have been more important than Roshonemore important than Amaram Hed have been able to go to the Shattered Plains and fight in a real war No more squabbling over borders No more petty lighteyed captains belonging to unimportant families bitter because theyd been left behind He would never again have had to worry about blisters from boots that didnt fit dinner slop that tasted of crem or other soldiers who wanted to pick a fight He could have been rich Hed given it all away just like that And still the mere thought of touching that Blade turned his stomach He didnt want wealth titles armies or even a good meal He wanted to be able to go back and protect the men who had trusted him Why had he chased after the Shardbearer He should have run But no hed insisted on charging at a storming Shardbearer You protected your highmarshal he told himself Youre a hero But why was Amarams life worth more than those of his men Kaladin served Amaram because of the honor he had shown He let spearmen share his comfort in the warcenter during highstorms a different squad each storm He insisted that his men be well fed and well paid He didnt treat them like slime He did let his subordinates do so though And hed broken his promise to shelter Tien So did I So did I Kaladins insides were a twisted mess of guilt and sorrow One thing remained clear like a bright spot of light on the wall of a dark room He wanted nothing to do with those Shards He didnt even want to touch them The door thumped open and Kaladin turned in his chair Amaram entered Tall lean with a square face and long martial coat of deep green He walked on a crutch Kaladin eyed the wrappings and splint with a critical eye I could have done better Hed also have insisted that the patient remain in bed Amaram was talking to one of his stormwardens a middleaged man with a square beard and robes of deep black why Thaidakar would risk this Amaram was saying speaking in a soft voice But who else would it be The Ghostbloods grow more bold Well need to find out who he was Do we know anything about him He was Veden Brightlord the stormwarden said Nobody I recognize But I will investigate Amaram nodded falling silent Behind the two a group of lighteyed officers entered one of them carrying the Shardblade holding it on a pure white cloth Behind this group came the four surviving members of Kaladins squad Hab Reesh Alabet and Coreb Kaladin stood up feeling exhausted Amaram remained by the door arms folded as two final men entered and closed the door These last two were also lighteyes but lesser onesofficers in Amarams personal guard Had these been among those who had fled It was the smart thing to do Kaladin thought Smarter than what I did Amaram leaned on his walking staff inspecting Kaladin with bright tan eyes Hed been in conference with his counselors for several hours now trying to discover who the Shardbearer had been You did a brave thing today soldier Amaram said to Kaladin I What did you say to that I wish Id left you to die sir Thank you Everyone else fled including my honor guard The two men closest to the door looked down ashamed But you charged in for the attack Why I didnt really think about it sir Amaram seemed displeased by the answer Your name is Kaladin is it Yes Brightlord From Hearthstone Remember Amaram frowned looking confused Your cousin Roshone is citylord there He sent my brother into the army when you came recruiting II joined with my brother Ah yes Amaram said I believe I remember you He didnt ask after Tien You still havent answered my question Why attack It wasnt for the Shardblade You rejected that Yes sir To the side the stormwarden raised his eyebrows as if he hadnt believed that Kaladin had turned down the Shards The soldier holding the Shardblade kept glancing at it in awe Why Amaram said Why did you reject it I have to know I dont want it sir Yes but why Because it would make me one of you Because I cant look at that weapon and not see the faces of the men its wielder slaughtered so offhandedly Becausebecause I cant really answer that sir Kaladin said sighing The stormwarden walked over to the rooms brazier shaking his head He began warming his hands Look Kaladin said Those Shards are mine Well I said to give them to Coreb Hes the highest ranked of my soldiers and the best fighter among them The other three would understand Besides Coreb would take care of them once he was a lighteyes Amaram looked at Coreb then nodded to his attendants One closed the window shutters The others pulled out swords then began moving toward the four remaining members of Kaladins squad Kaladin yelled leaping forward but two of the officers had positioned themselves close to him One slammed a punch into Kaladins gut as soon as he started moving He was so surprised that it connected directly and he gasped No He fought off the pain turning to swing at the man The mans eyes opened wide as Kaladins fist connected throwing him backward Several other men piled on him He had no weapons and he was so tired from the battle that he could barely stay upright They knocked him to the ground with punches to his side and back He collapsed to the floor pained but still able to watch as the soldiers came at his men Reesh was cut down first Kaladin gasped stretching out a hand struggling to his knees This cant happen Please no Hab and Alabet had their knives out but fell quickly one soldier gutting Hab as two others hacked down Alabet Alabets knife thumped as it hit the ground followed by his arm then finally his corpse Coreb lasted the longest backing away hands held forward He didnt scream He seemed to understand Kaladins eyes were watering and soldiers grabbed him from behind stopping him from helping Corebs fell to his knees and began to beg One of Amarams men took him at the neck neatly severing his head It was over in seconds You bastard Kaladin said gasping against his pain You storming bastard Kaladin found himself weeping struggling uselessly at the four men holding him The blood of the fallen spearmen soaked the boards They were dead All of them were dead Stormfather All of them Amaram stepped forward expression grim He went down on one knee before Kaladin Im sorry Bastard Kaladin screamed as loud as he could I couldnt risk them telling what they saw This is what must be soldier Its for the good of the army Theyre going to be told that your squad helped the Shardbearer You see the men must believe that I killed him Youre taking the Shards for yourself I am trained in the sword Amaram said and am accustomed to plate It will serve Alethkar best if I bear the Shards You could have asked me for them Storm you And when news got around camp Amaram said grimly That youd killed the Shardbearer but I had the Shards Nobody would believe that youd given them up of your own free choice Besides son You wouldnt have let me keep them Amaram shook his head Youd have changed your mind In a day or two youd have wanted the wealth and prestigeothers would convince you of it Youd have demanded that I return them to you It took hours to decide but Restares is rightthis is what must be done For the good of Alethkar Its not about Alethkar Its about you Storm it youre supposed to be better than the others Tears dripped from Kaladins chin Amaram looked guilty suddenly as if he knew what Kaladin had said was true He turned away waving to the stormwarden The man turned from the brazier holding something hed been heating in the coals A small branding iron Its all an act Kaladin asked The honorable brightlord who cares about his men Lies All of it This is for my men Amaram said He took the Shardblade from the cloth holding it in his hand The gemstone at its pommel let out a flash of white light You cant begin to understand the weights I carry spearman Amarams voice lost some of its calm tone of reason He sounded defensive I cant worry about the lives of a few darkeyed spearmen when thousands of people may be saved by my decision The stormwarden stepped up to Kaladin positioning the branding iron The glyphs reversed read sas nahn A slaves brand You came for me Amaram said limping to the door stepping around Reeshs body For saving my life I spare yours Five men telling the same story would have been believed but a single slave will be ignored The warcamp will be told that you didnt try to help your fellowsbut you didnt try to stop them either You fled and were captured by my guard Amaram hesitated by the door resting the blunt edge of the stolen Shardblade on his shoulder The guilt was still there in his eyes but he grew hard covering it You are being discharged as a deserter and branded as a slave But you are spared death by my mercy He opened the door and walked out The branding iron fell searing Kaladins fate into his skin He let out a final ragged scream THE END OF Part Three Baxil hastened down the lavish palace corridor clutching the bulky bag of tools A sound like a footfall came from behind him and he jumped spinning He didnt see anything The corridor was empty a golden carpet lining the floor mirrors on the walls arched ceiling inlaid with elaborate mosaics Would you stop that Av said walking beside him Every time you jump I nearly cuff you one out of surprise I cant help it Baxil said Shouldnt we be doing this at night Mistress knows what shes doing Av said Like Baxil Av was Emuli with dark skin and hair But the taller man was far more selfconfident He sauntered down the halls acting as if theyd been invited thickbladed sword slung in a sheath over his shoulder If the Prime Kadasix may provide Baxil thought Id rather Av never have to draw that weapon Thank you Their mistress walked ahead of them the only other person in the hallway She wasnt Emulishe didnt even seem Makabaki though she had dark skin and long beautiful black hair She had eyes like a Shin but she was tall and lean like an Alethi Av thought she was a mixed breed Or so he said when they dared talk about such things The mistress had good ears Strangely good ears She stopped at the next intersection Baxil caught himself glancing over his shoulder again Av elbowed him but he couldnt help looking Yes the mistress claimed that the palace servants would be busy getting the new guest wing ready but this was the home of Ashno of Sages himself One of the richest and holiest men in all of Emul He had hundreds of servants What if one of them walked down this hallway The two men joined their mistress at the intersection He forced his eyes forward so he wouldnt keep looking over his shoulder but then found himself staring at the mistress It was dangerous being employed by a woman as beautiful as she was with that long black hair worn free hanging down to her waist She never wore a proper womans robe or even a dress or skirt Always trousers usually sleek and tight a thinbladed sword at her hip Her eyes were so faintly violet they were almost white She was amazing Wonderful intoxicating overwhelming Av elbowed him in the ribs again Baxil jumped then glared at his cousin rubbing his belly Baxil the mistress said My tools He opened the bag handing over a folded tool belt It clinked as she took it not looking at him then she strode down the hallway to their left Baxil watched uncomfortable This was the Hallowed Hall the place where a wealthy man placed images of his Kadasix for reverence The mistress walked up to the first piece of art The painting depicted Epan Lady of Dreams It was beautiful a masterpiece of gold leaf on black canvas The mistress took a knife from her bundle and slashed the painting down the front Baxil cringed but said nothing Hed almost gotten used to the casual way she destroyed art though he was baffled by it She did pay the two of them very well however Av leaned back against the wall picking his teeth with a fingernail Baxil tried to imitate his relaxed pose The large hallway was lit with topaz chips set in beautiful chandeliers but they made no move to take them The mistress did not approve of stealing Ive been thinking of seeking the Old Magic Baxil said partially to keep himself from cringing as the mistress moved on to gouge out the eyes of a fine bust Av snorted Why I dont know Baxil said Seems like something to do with myself Ive never sought it you know and they say every man gets one chance Ask a boon of the Nightwatcher Have you used yours Nah Av said Dont fancy making the trip all the way to the Valley Besides my brother went Came back with two numb hands Never could feel anything with them again What was his boon Baxil asked as the mistress wrapped up a vase with a cloth then quietly shattered it on the floor and crushed the pieces Dont know Av said He never said Seemed embarrassed Probably asked for something silly like a good haircut Av smirked I was thinking Id make myself more useful Baxil said Ask for courage you know If you want Av replied I figure there are better ways than the Old Magic You never know what kind of curse youll end up with I could phrase my request perfectly Baxil said Doesnt work that way Av said Its not a game no matter how the stories try to put it The Nightwatcher doesnt trick you or twist your words You ask a boon She gives what she feels you deserve then gives you a curse to go along with it Sometimes related sometimes not And youre an expert Baxil asked The mistress was slashing another painting I thought you said you never went I didnt Av said On account of my father going my mother going and each of my brothers going A few got what they wanted Most all of them regretted the curse save my father He got a heap of good cloth sold to keep us from starving during the lurnip famine a few decades ago What was his curse Baxil said Saw the world upside down from then on Really Yeah Av said Twisted all about Like people walk on the ceilings and the sky was underneath him Said he got used to it pretty quickly though and didnt really think it a curse by the time he died Even thinking about that curse made Baxil feel sick He looked down at his sack of tools If he werent such a coward would hemaybebe able to convince the mistress to see him as something more than just hired muscle If the Prime Kadasix could provide he thought it would be very nice if I could know the right thing to do Thank you The mistress returned hair somewhat disheveled She held out a hand Padded mallet Baxil Theres a full statue back there He responded pulling the mallet out of the sack and handing it to her Perhaps I should get myself a Shardblade she said absently putting the tool up on her shoulder But that might make this too easy I wouldnt mind if it were too easy mistress Baxil noted She sniffed walking back down the hallway Soon she began to pound on a statue at the far end breaking off its arms Baxil winced Someones going to hear that Yeah Av said Probably why she waited to do it last At least the pounding was muffled by the padding They had to be the only thieves who sneaked into the homes of rich men without taking anything Why does she do this Av Baxil found himself asking Dont know Maybe you should ask her I thought you said I should never do that Depends Av said How attached to your limbs are you Rather attached Well if you ever want that changed start asking the mistress prying questions Until then shut up Baxil said nothing further The Old Magic he thought It could change me I will go looking for it Knowing his luck though he wouldnt be able to find it He sighed resting back against the wall as muted thuds continued to come from the mistresss direction Im thinking of changing my Calling Ashir said from behind Geranid nodded absently as she worked on her equations The small stone room smelled sharply of spices Ashir was trying another new experiment It involved some kind of curry powder and a rare Shin fruit that hed caramelized Something like that She could hear it sizzling on his new fabrial hotplate Im tired of cooking Ashir continued He had a soft kindly voice She loved him for that Partially because he liked to talkand if you were going to have someone talk while you were attempting to think they might as well have a soft kindly voice I dont have passion for it as I once did he continued Besides what good will a cook be in the Spiritual Realm Heralds need food she said absently scratching out a line on her writing board then scribbling another line of numbers beneath it Do they Ashir asked Ive never been convinced Oh Ive read the speculations but it just doesnt seem rational to me The body must be fed in the Physical Realm but the spirit exists in a completely different state A state of ideals she replied So you could create ideal foods perhaps HmmWhat would be the fun in that No experimentation I could do without she said leaning forward to inspect the rooms hearth where two flamespren danced on the logs fire If it meant never again having to eat something like that green soup you made last month Ah he said sounding wistful That was something wasnt it Completely revolting yet made entirely from appetizing ingredients He seemed to consider it a personal triumph I wonder if they eat in the Cognitive Realm Is a food there what it sees itself as being Ill have to read and see if anyone has ever eaten while visiting Shadesmar Geranid responded with a noncommittal grunt getting out her calipers and leaning closer to the heat to measure the flamespren She frowned then made another notation Here love Ashir said walking over then knelt beside her and offered a small bowl Give this a try I think youll like it She eyed the contents Bits of bread covered with a red sauce It was mens food but they were both ardents so that didnt matter From outside came the sounds of waves gently lapping against the rocks They were on a tiny Reshi island technically sent to provide for the religious needs of any Vorin visitors Some travelers did come to them for that occasionally even some of the Reshi But really this was a way of getting away and focusing on their experiments Geranid with her spren studies Ashir with his chemistrythrough cooking of course as it allowed him to eat the results The portly man smiled affably head shaven grey beard neatly squared off They both kept to the rules of their stations despite their seclusion One did not write the ending of a lifetime of faith with a sloppy last chapter No green she noted taking the bowl Thats a good sign Hmmm he said leaning down and adjusting his spectacles to inspect her notations Yes It really was fascinating the way that Shin vegetable caramelized Im so pleased that Gom brought it to me Youll have to go over my notes I think I got the figures right but I could be wrong He wasnt as strong at mathematics as he was at theory Conveniently Geranid was just the opposite She took a spoon and tried the food She didnt wear a sleeve on her safehandanother one of the advantages of being an ardent The food was actually quite good Did you try this Ashir Nope he said still looking over her figures Youre the brave one my dear She sniffed Its terrible I can see that from how youre taking another large bite at this moment Yes but youd hate it No fruit Is this fish you added A dried handful of the little minnows I caught outside this morning Still dont know what species they are Tasty though He hesitated then looked up at the hearth and its spren Geranid what is this I think Ive had a breakthrough she said softly But the figures he said tapping the writing board You said they were erratic and they still are Yes she said narrowing her eyes at the flamespren But I can predict when they will be erratic and when they wont be He looked at her frowning The spren change when I measure them Ashir she said Before I measure they dance and vary in size luminosity and shape But when I make a notation they immediately freeze in their current state Then they remain that way permanently so far as I can tell What does it mean he asked Im hoping youll be able to tell me I have the figures Youve got the imagination dear one He scratched at his beard sitting back and produced a bowl and spoon for himself Hed sprinkled dried fruit over his portion Geranid was half convinced hed joined the ardentia because of his sweet tooth What happens if you erase the figures he asked The spren go back to being variable she said Length shape luminosity He took a bite of his mush Go into the other room What Just do it Take your writing board She sighed standing up joints popping Was she getting that old Starlight but theyd spent a long time out on this island She walked to the other room where their cot was What now she called Im going to measure the spren with your calipers he called back Ill take three measurements in a row Only write down one of the figures I give you Dont tell me which one youre writing down All right she called back The window was open and she looked out over a darkening glassy expanse of water The Reshi Sea wasnt as shallow as the Purelake but it was quite warm most of the time dotted with tropical islands and the occasional monster of a greatshell Three inches seven tenths Ashir called She didnt write down the figure Two inches eight tenths She ignored the number this time too but got her chalk ready to writeas quietly as possiblethe next numbers he called out Two inches three tenWow What she called It stopped changing sizes I assume you wrote down that third number She frowned walking back into their small living chamber Ashirs hotplate sat on a low table to her right After the Reshi style there were no chairs just cushions and all the furniture was flat and long rather than tall She approached the hearth One of the two flamespren danced about atop a log shape changing and length flickering like the flames themselves The other had taken on a far more stable shape Its length no longer changed though its form did slightly It seemed locked somehow It almost looked like a little person as it danced over the fire She reached up and erased her notation It immediately began pulsing and changing erratically like the other one Wow Ashir repeated Its as if it knows somehow that it has been measured As if merely defining its form traps it somehow Write down a number What number Any number he said But one that might be the size of a flamespren She did so Nothing happened You have to actually measure it he said tapping his spoon softly against the side of his bowl No pretending I wonder at the precision of the instrument she said If I use one that is less precise will that give the spren more flexibility Or is there a threshold an accuracy beyond which it finds itself bound She sat down feeling daunted I need to research this more Try it for luminosity then compare that to my general equation of flamespren luminosity as compared to the fire theyre drawn to dance around Ashir grimaced That my dear sounds a lot like math Indeed Then I shall make you a snack to occupy you while you create new marvels of calculation and genius He smiled kissing her forehead You just found something wonderful he said more softly I dont know what it means yet but it might very well change everything we understand about spren And maybe even about fabrials She smiled turning back to her equations And for once she didnt mind at all as he began chatting about his ingredients working out a new formula for some sugary confection he was sure shed love SzethsonsonVallano Truthless of Shinovar spun between the two guards as their eyes burned out They slumped quietly to the floor With three quick strokes he slashed his Shardblade through the hinges and latch of the grand door Then he took a deep breath absorbing the Stormlight from a pouch of gemstones at his waist He burst alight with renewed power and kicked the door with the force of a Lightenhanced foot It flew backward into the room hinges no longer holding it in place then crashed to the floor skidding on the stone The large feast hall inside was filled with people crackling hearths and clattering plates The heavy door slid to a halt and the room grew quiet I am sorry he thought Then he dashed in to start the slaughter Chaos ensued Screams yells panic Szeth leaped atop the nearest dining table and started spinning cutting down everyone nearby As he did so he made certain to listen to the sounds of the dying He did not shut his ears to the screams He did not ignore the wails of pain He paid attention to each and every one And hated himself He moved forward leaping from table to table wielding his Shardblade a god of burning Stormlight and death Armsmen yelled the lighteyed man at the edge of the room Where are my armsmen Thick of waist and shoulder the man had a square brown beard and a prominent nose King Hanavanar of Jah Keved Not a Shardbearer though some rumors said that he secretly kept a Shardblade Near Szeth men and women scrambled away stumbling over one another He dropped among them his white clothing rippling He cut through a man who was drawing his swordbut also sliced through three women who wanted only to escape Eyes burned and bodies collapsed Szeth reached behind himself infusing the table hed leaped from then Lashing it to the far wall with a Basic Lashing the type that changed which direction was down The large wooden table fell to the side tumbling into people causing more screams and more pain Szeth found himself crying His orders were simple Kill Kill as you have never killed before Lay the innocent screaming at your feet and make the lighteyes weep Do so wearing white so all know who you are Szeth did not object It was not his place He was Truthless And he did as his masters demanded Three lighteyed men got up the nerve to attack him and Szeth raised his Shardblade in salute They screamed battle cries as they charged He was silent A flick of his wrist cut the blade from the first ones sword The length of metal spun in the air as Szeth stepped between the other two his Blade swishing through their necks They dropped in tandem eyes shriveling Szeth struck the first man from behind ramming the Blade through his back and out his chest The man dropped forwarda hole in his shirt but his skin unmarred As he hit the floor his severed sword blade clanged to the stones beside him Another group came at Szeth from the side and he drew Stormlight into his hand and flung it in a Full Lashing across the floor at their feet This was the Lashing that bonded objects when the men crossed it their shoes stuck to the floor They tripped and found their hands and bodies Lashed to the floor as well Szeth stepped through them mournfully striking The king edged away as if to round the chamber and escape Szeth sprayed a tables top with a Full Lashing then infused the entire thing with a Basic Lashing as well pointed at the doorway The table flipped into the air and crashed against the exitthe side bearing the Full Lashing sticking it to the wall People tried to pry it out of the way but that only made them bunch up as Szeth waded into them Shardblade sweeping So many deaths Why What purpose did it fulfill When hed assaulted Alethkar six years before hed thought that had been a massacre He hadnt known what a true massacre was He reached the door and found himself standing over the bodies of some thirty people his emotions caught up in the tempest of Stormlight within him He hated that Stormlight suddenly as much as he hated himself As much as the cursed Blade he held Andand the king Szeth spun on the man Irrationally his confused broken mind blamed this man Why had he called a feast on this night Why couldnt he have retired early Why had he invited so many people Szeth charged at the king He passed the dead who lay twisted on the floor burnedout eyes staring in lifeless accusation The king cowered behind his high table That high table shuddered quivering oddly Something was wrong Instinctively Szeth Lashed himself to the ceiling From his viewpoint the room flipped and the floor was now the ceiling Two figures burst out from beneath the kings table Two men in Plate carrying Shardblades swinging Twisting in the air Szeth evaded their swings then Lashed himself back to the floor landing on the kings table just as the king summoned a Shardblade So the rumors were true The king struck but Szeth jumped backward landing beyond the Shardbearers Outside he could hear footfalls Szeth glanced to see men pouring into the room The newcomers carried distinctive diamondshaped shields Halfshards Szeth had heard of the new fabrials capable of stopping a Shardblade You think I didnt know you were coming the king yelled at him After you killed three of my highprinces Were ready for you assassin He lifted something from beneath the table Another of those halfshard shields They were made of metal imbedded with a gemstone hidden at the back You are a fool Szeth said Stormlight leaking from his mouth Why the king called You think I should have run No Szeth replied meeting his eyes Because you set a trap for me during a feast And now I can blame you for their deaths The soldiers fanned out through the room while the two fully armored Shardbearers stepped toward him Blades out The king smiled So let it be Szeth said breathing deeply sucking in the Stormlight of the many gemstones tied in the pouches at his waist The Light began to rage within him like a highstorm in his chest burning and screaming He breathed in more than hed ever held before holding it until he was barely able to keep the Stormlight from ripping him apart Were those still tears in his eyes Would that they could hide his crimes He yanked the strap free at his waist releasing his belt and the heavy spheres Then he dropped his Shardblade His opponents froze in shock as his Blade vanished to mist Who would drop a Shardblade in the middle of a battle It defied reason And so did Szeth You are a work of art SzethsonNeturo A god It was time to see The soldiers and Shardbearers charged Mere heartbeats before they reached him Szeth spun into motion liquid tempest in his veins He dodged between the initial sword strikes spinning into the midst of the soldiers Holding this much Stormlight made it easier to infuse things the light wanted out and it pushed against his skin In this state the Shardblade would only be a distraction Szeth himself was the real weapon He grabbed the arm of an attacking soldier It took only an instant to infuse and Lash him upward The man cried out falling into the air as Szeth ducked another sword thrust He touched the attackers leg inhumanly lithe With a look and a blink he Lashed that man to the ceiling as well Soldiers cursed slashing at him their bulky halfshards suddenly becoming hindrances as Szeth moved among them graceful as a skyeel touching arms legs shoulders sending a dozen then two dozen men flying in all directions Most went up but he sent a barrage of them toward the approaching Shardbearers who cried out as squirming bodies smashed into them He jumped backward as a squad of soldiers came at him Lashing himself to the far wall and spinning into the air The room changed orientations and he landed on the wallwhich was now down for him He ran along it toward the king who waited behind his Shardbearers Kill him the king said Storm you all What are you doing Kill him Szeth leaped off the wall Lashing himself downward as he flipped landing with one knee on the dining table Silverware and plates clinked as he grabbed a dining knife and infused once twice three times He used a triple Basic Lashing pointing it in the direction of the king then dropped it and Lashed himself backward He lurched away as one of the Shardbearers struck cutting the table in half Szeths released knife fell far more quickly than it should have flashing toward the king He barely got his shield up in time eyes wide as the knife clanged against the metal Damnation Szeth thought Lashing himself upward with a quarter of a Basic Lashing That didnt pull him upward it just made him much lighter A quarter of his weight was now pulled upward instead of downward In essence he became half as heavy as he had been He twisted white clothing flapping gracefully as he dropped amid the common soldiers Soldiers hed Lashed earlier began to fall from the high ceiling their Stormlight running out A rain of broken bodies crashing one by one to the floor Szeth came at the soldiers again Some men fell as he sent others flying Their expensive shields clanged to the stones falling from dead or stunned fingers Soldiers tried to reach him but Szeth danced between them using the ancient martial art of kammar which used only the hands It was meant as a less deadly form of fighting focused on grabbing enemies and using their weight against them immobilizing them It was also ideal when one wanted to touch and infuse someone He was the storm He was destruction At his will men flipped into the air fell and died He swept outward touching a table and Lashing it upward with half a Basic Lashing With half its mass pulled upward half downward it became weightless Szeth sprayed it with a Full Lashing then kicked it toward the soldiers they stuck to it their clothing and skin bonding to the wood A Shardblade hissed through the air beside him and Szeth exhaled lightly Stormlight rising from his lips as he ducked out of the way The two Shardbearers attacked as bodies fell from above but Szeth was too quick too limber The Shardbearers didnt work together They were accustomed to dominating a battlefield or dueling with a single enemy Their powerful weapons made them sloppy Szeth ran on light feet held to the ground only half as much as other men He easily leaped another swipe Lashing himself to the ceiling to give himself just a little more lift before quarterLashing to make himself weighted down again The result was an effortless leap of ten feet into the air The missed swing hit the ground and cut through the belt hed dropped earlier opening one of his large pouches Spheres and bare gemstones sprayed across the floor Some infused Some dun Szeth pulled Stormlight from those that rolled close Behind the Shardbearers the king himself approached weapon ready He should have tried to run The two Shardbearers swung their oversized Blades at Szeth He spun away from the attacks reaching out and snatching a shield from the air as it tumbled toward the ground The man who had been holding it crashed to the floor a second later Szeth leaped at one of the Shardbearersa man in gold armordeflecting his weapon with the shield and pushing past him The other man whose Plate was red swung too Szeth caught the Blade on his shield which cracked barely holding Still pushing it against the Blade Szeth Lashed himself behind the Shardbearer while jumping forward The move flipped Szeth up and over the man Szeth went on falling toward the far wall as the second wave of soldiers began to drop to the floor One crashed into the Shardbearer in red making him stumble Szeth hit the wall landing against the stones He was so full of Stormlight So much power so much life so much terrible terrible destruction Stone It was sacred He never thought about that anymore How could anything be sacred to him now As bodies crashed into the Shardbearers he knelt and placed his hand on a large stone in the wall before him infusing it He Lashed it time and time again in the direction of the Shardbearers Once twice ten times fifteen times He kept pouring Stormlight into it It glowed brightly Mortar cracked Stone ground against stone The red Shardbearer turned just as the massive infused rock fell toward him moving with twenty times the normal acceleration of a falling stone It crashed into him shattering his breastplate spraying molten bits in all directions The block hurled him across the room crushing him against the far wall He did not move Szeth was nearly out of Stormlight now He quarterLashed himself to reduce his weight then loped across the ground Men were crushed broken dead around him Spheres rolled on the floor and he drew in their Stormlight The Light streamed up like the souls of those he had killed infusing him He began to run The other Shardbearer stumbled backward holding up his Blade stepping onto the wood of a shattered tabletop the legs of which had broken free The king finally realized his trap was failing He started to flee Ten heartbeats Szeth thought Return to me you creation of Damnation Szeths heartbeats began to thump in his ears He screamedLight bursting from his mouth like radiant smokeand threw himself to the ground as the Shardbearer swung Szeth Lashed himself toward the far wall skidding through the Shardbearers legs He immediately Lashed himself upward He soared into the air as the Shardbearer rounded on him again But Szeth wasnt there He Lashed himself back downward dropping behind the Shardbearer to land on the broken tabletop He stooped and infused it A man in Shardplate might be protected from Lashings but the things he stood upon were not Szeth Lashed the plank upward with a multiple Lashing It lurched into the air tossing aside the Shardbearer like a toy soldier Szeth himself stayed atop the board riding it upward in a rush of air As it reached the lofty ceiling he threw himself off Lashing himself downward once twice three times The tabletop crashed to the ceiling Szeth fell with incredible speed toward the Shardbearer who lay dazed on his back Szeths Blade formed in his fingers just as he hit driving the weapon down through Shardplate The breastplate exploded and the Blade sank deeply through the mans chest and into the floor underneath Szeth stood pulling his Shardblade free The fleeing king looked over his shoulder with a cry of disbelieving horror Both of his Shardbearers had fallen in a matter of seconds The last of the soldiers nervously moved in to protect his retreat Szeth had stopped crying It seemed like he couldnt cry any longer He felt numb His mindit just couldnt think He hated the king Hated him so badly And it hurt physically hurt him how strong that irrational hatred was Stormlight rising from him he Lashed himself toward the king He fell feet just above the ground as if he were floating His clothing rippled To those guards still alive he would seem to be gliding across the ground He Lashed himself downward at a slight angle and began to swing his Blade as he reached the ranks of the soldiers He ran through them as if he were moving down a steep slope Swirling and spinning he dropped a dozen men graceful and terrible drawing in more Stormlight from spheres that had been scattered on the floor Szeth reached the doorway men with burning eyes falling to the ground behind him Just outside the king ran amid a final small group of guards He turned and cried out as he saw Szeth then threw up his halfshard shield Szeth wove through the guards then hit the shield twice shattering it and forcing the king backward The man tripped dropping his Blade It puffed away to mist Szeth leaped up and Lashed himself downward with a double Basic Lashing He hit atop the king his increased weight breaking an arm and pinning the man to the ground Szeth swept his blade through the surprised soldiers who fell as their legs died beneath them Finally Szeth raised his Blade over his head looking down at the king What are you the man whispered eyes watering with pain Death Szeth said then drove his Blade pointfirst through the mans face and into the rock below Im standing over the body of a brother Im weeping Is that his blood or mine What have we done Dated Vevanev 1173 107 seconds predeath Subject an outofwork Veden sailor Father Adolin said pacing in Dalinars sitting room This is insane That is appropriate Dalinar replied dryly Asit appearsI am as well I never claimed you were insane Actually Renarin noted I believe that you did Adolin glanced at his brother Renarin stood beside the hearth inspecting the new fabrial that had been installed there just a few days ago The infused ruby encased in a metal enclosure glowed softly and gave off a comfortable heat It was convenient though it felt wrong to Adolin that no fire lay crackling there The three were alone in Dalinars sitting room awaiting the advent of the days highstorm It had been one week since Dalinar had informed his sons of his intention to step down as highprince Adolins father sat in one of his large highbacked chairs hands laced before him stoic The warcamps didnt know of his decision yetbless the Heraldsbut he intended to make the announcement soon Perhaps at tonights feast All right fine Adolin said Perhaps I said it But I didnt mean it Or at least I didnt mean for it to have this effect on you We had this discussion a week ago Adolin Dalinar said softly Yes and you promised to think over your decision I have My resolve has not wavered Adolin continued to pace Renarin stood up straight watching him as he stalked past Im a fool Adolin thought Of course this is what Father would do I should have seen it Look Adolin said just because you might have some problems doesnt mean you have to abdicate Adolin our enemies will use my weakness against us In fact you believe that they are already doing so If I dont give up the princedom now matters could grow much worse than they are now But I dont want to be highprince Adolin complained Not yet at least Leadership is rarely about what we want son I think too few among the Alethi elite realize that fact And what will happen to you Adolin asked pained He stopped and looked toward his father Dalinar was so firm even sitting there contemplating his own madness Hands clasped before him wearing a stiff blue uniform with a coat of Kholin blue silver hair dusting his temples Those hands of his were thick and callused his expression determined Dalinar made a decision and stuck to it not wavering or debating Mad or not he was what Alethkar needed And Adolin hadin his hastedone what no warrior on the battlefield had ever been able to do chop Dalinar Kholins legs out from under him and send him away in defeat Oh Stormfather Adolin thought stomach twisting in pain Jezerezeh Kelek and Ishi Heralds above Let me find a way to right this Please I will return to Alethkar Dalinar said Though I hate to leave our army here down a Shardbearer Could Ibut no I could not give them up Of course not Adolin said aghast A Shardbearer giving up his Shards It almost never happened unless the Bearer was too weak and sickly to use them Dalinar nodded I have long worried that our homeland is in danger now that every single Shardbearer fights out here on the Plains Well perhaps this change of winds is a blessing I will return to Kholinar and aid the queen make myself useful fighting against border incursions Perhaps the Reshi and the Vedens will be less likely to strike against us if they know that theyd be facing a full Shardbearer Thats possible Adolin said But they could also escalate and start sending a Shardbearer of their own on raids That seemed to worry his father Jah Keved was the only other kingdom in Roshar that owned a substantial number of Shards nearly as many as Alethkar There hadnt been a direct war between them in centuries Alethkar had been too divided and Jah Keved was little better But if the two kingdoms clashed in force it would be a war the like of which hadnt been seen since the days of the Hierocracy Distant thunder rumbled outside and Adolin turned sharply toward Dalinar His father remained in his chair staring westward away from the storm We will continue this discussion afterward Dalinar said For now you two should tie my arms to the chair Adolin grimaced but did as he was told without complaint Dalinar blinked looking around He was on the battlement of a singlewalled fortress Crafted from large blocks of deep red stone the wall was sheer and straight It was built across a rift in the leeward side of a tall rock formation overlooking an open plain of stone like a wet leaf stuck across a crack in a boulder These visions feel so real Dalinar thought glancing at the spear he held in his hand and then down at his antiquated uniform a cloth skirt and leather jerkin It was hard to remember that he was really sitting in his chair arms tied down He couldnt feel the ropes or hear the highstorm He considered waiting out the vision doing nothing If this wasnt real why should he participate Yet he didnt completely believecouldnt completely believethat he was coming up with these delusions on his own His decision to abdicate to Adolin was motivated by his doubts Was he mad Was he misinterpreting At the very least he could no longer trust himself He didnt know what was real and what wasnt In such a situation a man should step down from his authority and sort things through Either way he felt he needed to live these visions not ignore them A desperate piece of him still hoped to come to a solution before he had to abdicate formally He didnt let that piece gain too much controla man had to do what was right But Dalinar would give it this much He would treat the vision as real while he was part of it If there were secrets to be found here only by playing along would he find them He looked about him What was he being shown this time and why The spearhead on his weapon was of good steel though his cap appeared to be bronze One of the six men with him on the wall wore a breastplate of bronze two others had poorly patched leather uniforms sliced and resewn with wide stitches The other men lounged about idly looking out over the wall Guard duty Dalinar thought stepping up and scanning the landscape outside This rock formation was at the end of an enormous plainthe perfect situation for a fortress No army could approach without being seen long before its arrival The air was cold enough that clumps of ice clung to the stone in shadowed corners The sunlight did little to dispel the cold and the weather explained the lack of grass the blades would be retracted into their holes awaiting the relief of spring weather Dalinar pulled his cloak closer prompting one of his companions to do the same Storming weather the man muttered How longs it going to last Been eight weeks already Eight weeks Forty days of winter at once That was rare Despite the cold the other three soldiers looked anything but engaged by their guard duties One was even dozing Stay alert Dalinar chided them They glanced at him the one who had been dozing blinking awake All three seemed incredulous Onea tall redhaired manscowled This from you Leef Dalinar bit back a retort Who did they see him as The chill air made his breath steam and from behind him he could hear metal clanging as men worked at forges and anvils below The gates to the fortress were closed and the archer towers were manned to the left and right They were at war but guard duty was always boring work It took well trained soldiers to remain alert for hours on end Perhaps that was why there were so many soldiers here if the quality of eyes watching could not be assured then quantity would serve However Dalinar had an advantage The visions never showed him episodes of idle peace they threw him into times of conflict and change Turning points So it was that despite dozens of other eyes watching he was the first to spot it There he said leaning out over the side of the roughstone crenellation What is that The redheaded man raised a hand shading his eyes Nothing A shadow No its moving said one of the others Looks like people Marching Dalinars heart began to thump in anticipation as the redhaired man called the alert More archers rushed onto the battlement stringing bows Soldiers gathered in the ruddy courtyard below Everything was made of that same red rock and Dalinar caught one of the men referring to this place as Feverstone Keep Hed never heard of it Scouts galloped from the keep on horses Why didnt they have outriders already It has to be the rear defense force one soldier muttered They cant have gotten through our lines Not with the Radiants fighting Radiants Dalinar stepped closer to listen but the man gave him a scowl and turned away Whoever Dalinar was the others didnt much care for him Apparently this keep was a fallback position behind the front lines of a war So either that approaching force was friendly or the enemy had punched through and sent an advance element to besiege the keep These were reserves then which was probably why they had been left with a few horses They still should have had outriders When the scouts finally did gallop back to the keep they bore white flags Dalinar glanced at his companions confirming his suspicions as they relaxed White meant friends Yet would he have been sent here if it were that simple If it was just in his mind would it fabricate a simple boring vision when it never had before We need to be alert for a trap Dalinar said Someone find out what those scouts saw Did they identify banners only or did they get a close look The other soldiersincluding some of the archers who now filled the wall topgave him strange looks Dalinar cursed softly glancing back out at the shadowy oncoming force He had a foreboding itch in the back of his skull Ignoring the odd looks he hefted his spear and ran down the walkway of the wall top reaching a set of stairs They were built in switchbacks running in zigzags straight down the tall wall with no railing Hed been on such fortifications before and knew how to keep his eyes focused on the steps to avoid vertigo He reached the bottom andspear resting on his shoulderstruck out to find someone in charge The buildings of Feverstone Keep were blocky and utilitarian built up against one another along the rock walls of the natural rift Most had square raincatchers on top With good food storesor if lucky a Soulcastersuch a fortification could withstand a siege for years He couldnt read the rank insignias but he could recognize an officer when he saw one standing in a bloodred cloak with a group of honor guards He had no mail just a shiny bronze breastplate over leather and was conferring with one of the scouts Dalinar hurried up Only then did he see that the mans eyes were dark brown That gave Dalinar a shock of incredulity Those around him treated the man like a brightlord the Order of the Stonewards my lord the stillmounted scout was saying And a large number of Windrunners All on foot But why the darkeyed officer demanded Why are Radiants coming here They should be fighting the devils on the front lines My lord the scout said our orders were to return as soon as we identified them Well go back and find out why theyre here the officer bellowed causing the scout to flinch then turn to ride away The Radiants They were usually connected to Dalinars visions in one way or another As the officer began to call commands to his attendants telling them to prep empty bunkers for the knights Dalinar followed the scout toward the wall Men crowded near the kill slits there peering out at the plain Like those above these wore motley uniforms that looked pieced together They werent a ragged bunch but were obviously wearing secondhand leavings The scout rode through a sally port as Dalinar entered the shadow of the enormous wall walking up to the back of a crowd of soldiers What is it he asked The Radiants one of the men said Theyve broken into a run Its almost like theyre going to attack said another He chuckled at how ridiculous that sounded though there was an edge of uncertainty to his voice What Dalinar thought anxious Let me through Surprisingly the men parted As Dalinar pushed by he could sense their confusion Hed given the command with the authority of a highprince and a lighteyes and theyd obeyed instinctively Now that they saw him they were uncertain What was this simple guardsman doing ordering them about He didnt give them a chance to question him He climbed onto the platform against the wall where a rectangular kill slit looked through the wall and onto the plain It was too small for a man to get through but wide enough for archers to fire out Through it Dalinar saw that the approaching soldiers had formed a distinct line Men and women in gleaming Shardplate charged forward The scout pulled to a halt looking at the charging Shardbearers They ran shoulder to shoulder not a single one of place Like a crystalline wave As they drew closer Dalinar could see that their Plate was unpainted but it glowed either blue or amber at the joints and across glyphs at the front as with other Radiants hed seen in his visions They dont have their Shardblades out Dalinar said Thats a good sign The scout outside backed his horse up There looked to be a good two hundred Shardbearers out there Alethkar owned some twenty Blades Jah Keved a similar number If one added up all the rest in the world there might be enough total to equal the two powerful Vorin kingdoms That meant so far as he knew there were less than hundred Blades in all of the world And here he saw two hundred Shardbearers gathered in one army It was mindnumbing The Radiants slowed falling into a trot then a walk The soldiers around Dalinar grew still The leading Radiants stopped in a line immobile Suddenly others began to fall from the sky They hit with the sound of rock cracking puffs of Stormlight blossoming from their figures These all glowed blue Soon there were some three hundred Radiants out on the field They began summoning their Blades The weapons appeared in their hands like fog forming and condensing It was done in silence Their visors were down If them charging without swords was a good sign whispered one of the men beside Dalinar then what does this mean A suspicion began to rise within Dalinar the horror that he might know what this vision was about to show him The scout at last unnerved turned his horse and galloped back to the keep screaming for the door to be opened to him As if a little wood and stone would be a protection against hundreds of Shardbearers A single man with Plate and Blade was almost an army unto himself and that wasnt accounting for the strange powers these people had The soldiers pulled the sally port open for the scout Making a snap decision Dalinar leaped down and charged to the opening Behind the officer Dalinar had seen earlier was clearing a path for himself to walk up to the kill slit Dalinar reached the open door darting through it just after the scout charged back into the courtyard Men called after Dalinar terrified He ignored them running out onto the open plain The expansive straight wall stretched above him like a highway up to the sun itself The Radiants were still distant though theyd stopped within bowshot Transfixed by the beautiful figures Dalinar slowed then stopped about a hundred feet away One knight stepped ahead of his companions his brilliant cape a rich blue His Shardblade of rippling steel had intricate carvings along the center He held it toward the keep for a moment Then he drove it pointfirst into the stone plain Dalinar blinked The Shardbearer removed his helm exposing a handsome head with blond hair and pale skin light as that of a man from Shinovar He tossed the helm to the ground beside his blade It rolled slightly as the Shardbearer made fists in his gauntlets arms at his sides He opened his palms wide and the gauntlets fell free to the rocky ground He turned his Shardplate falling off his bodybreastplate dropping free greaves slipping off Underneath he wore a rumpled blue uniform He stepped free of his bootlike sabatons and continued to walk away Shardplate and Shardbladethe most precious treasures any man could owntossed to the ground and abandoned like refuse The others began to follow suit Hundreds of men and women driving Shardblades into the stone and then removing their Plate The sound of metal hitting stone came like rain Then like thunder Dalinar found himself running forward The door behind him opened and some curious soldiers left the keep Dalinar reached the Shardblades They sprouted from the rock like glittering silver trees a forest of weapons They glowed softly in a way his own Shardblade never had but as he dashed among them their light started to fade A terrible feeling struck him A sense of immense tragedy of pain and betrayal Stopping where he stood he gasped hand to his chest What was happening What was that dreadful feeling that screaming he swore he could almost hear The Radiants They walked away from their discarded weapons They all seemed individuals now each walking alone despite the crowd Dalinar charged after them tripping over discarded breastplates and chunks of armor He finally stumbled free of it all Wait he called None of them turned He could now see others in the distance far off A crowd of soldiers not wearing Shardplate waiting for the Radiants to return Who were they and why hadnt they come forward Dalinar He caught up to the Radiantsthey werent walking very quicklyand grabbed one by the arm The man turned his skin was tan and his hair dark like an Alethi His eyes were of the palest blue Unnaturally so in factthe irises were nearly white Please Dalinar said Tell me why you are doing this The former Shardbearer pulled his arm free and continued to walk away Dalinar cursed then ran into the midst of the Shardbearers They were of all races and nationalities dark skin and light some with white Thaylen eyebrows others with the skin ripples of the Selay They walked with eyes forward not speaking to one another steps slow but resolute Will someone tell me why Dalinar bellowed This is it isnt it The Day of Recreance the day you betrayed mankind But why None of them spoke It was as if he didnt exist People spoke of betrayal of the day the Knights Radiant turned their backs on their fellow men What were they fighting and why had they stopped Two orders of knights were mentioned Dalinar thought But there were ten orders What of the other eight Dalinar fell to his knees in the sea of solemn individuals Please I must know Nearby some of the keeps soldiers had reached the Shardbladesbut rather than chasing after the Radiants these men were cautiously pulling the Blades free A few officers scrambled out of the keep calling for the Blades to be put down They were soon outnumbered by men who began boiling out of side gates and rushing toward the weapons They are the first a voice said Dalinar looked up to see that one of the knights had stopped beside him It was the man who looked Alethi He looked over his shoulder at the crowd gathering around the blades Men had begun to scream at one another everyone scrambling to get a Blade before they were all claimed They are the first the Radiant said turning to Dalinar Dalinar recognized the depth of that voice It was the voice that always spoke to him in these visions They were the first and they were also the last Is this the Day of Recreance Dalinar asked These events will go down in history the Radiant said They will be infamous You will have many names for what happened here But why Dalinar asked Please Why did they abandon their duty The figure seemed to study him I have said I that can not be of much help to you The Night of Sorrows will come and the True Desolation The Everstorm Then answer my questions Dalinar said Read the book Unite them The book The Way of Kings The figure turned and walked from him joining the other Radiants as they crossed the stone plain walking toward places unknown Dalinar looked back at the melee of soldiers rushing for Blades Many had already been claimed There werent enough Blades for everyone and some had begun raising theirs up using them to fend off those who got too close As he watched a bellowing officer with a Blade was attacked by two men behind him The glow from within the weapons had completely vanished The killing of that officer made others bold Other skirmishes started men scrambling to attack those who had Blades hoping to get one Eyes began to burn Screams shouts death Dalinar watched until he found himself in his quarters tied to his chair Renarin and Adolin watched nearby looking tense Dalinar blinked listening to the rain of the passing highstorm on the roof Ive returned he said to his sons You may calm yourselves Adolin helped untie the ropes while Renarin stood up and fetched Dalinar a cup of orange wine Once Dalinar was free Adolin stood back The youth folded his arms Renarin came back his face pale He looked to be having one of his episodes of weakness indeed his legs were trembling As soon as Dalinar took the cup the youth sat down in a chair and rested his head in his hands Dalinar sipped the sweet wine He had seen wars in his visions before He had seen deaths and monsters greatshells and nightmares And yet for some reason this one disturbed him more than any He found his own hand shaking as he raised the cup for a second sip Adolin was still looking at him Am I that bad to watch Dalinar asked The gibberish you speak is unnerving Father Renarin said Unearthly strange Skewed like a wooden building pushed to a slant by the wind You thrash about Adolin said You nearly tipped over the chair I had to hold it steady until you stilled Dalinar stood up sighing as he walked over to refill his cup And you still think I dont need to abdicate The episodes are containable Adolin said though he sounded disturbed My point was never to get you to abdicate I just didnt want you relying upon the delusions to make decisions about our houses future So long as you accept that what you see isnt real we can move on No reason for you to give up your seat Dalinar poured the wine He looked eastward toward the wall away from Adolin and Renarin I dont accept that what I see isnt real What Adolin said But I thought I convinced I accept that Im no longer reliable Dalinar said And that theres a chance I might be going mad I accept that something is happening to me He turned around When I first began seeing these visions I believed them to be from the Almighty You have convinced me that I may have been too hasty in my judgment I dont know enough to trust them I could be mad Or they could be supernatural without being of the Almighty How could that happen Adolin said frowning The Old Magic Renarin said softly still sitting Dalinar nodded What Adolin said pointedly The Old Magic is a myth Unfortunately it is not Dalinar said then took another drink of the cool wine I know this for a fact Father Renarin said For the Old Magic to have affected you youd have had to travel to the West and seek it Wouldnt you Yes he said ashamed The empty place in his memories where his wife had once existed had never seemed as obvious to him as it did at that moment He tended to ignore it with good reason Shed vanished completely and it was sometimes difficult for him to remember that he had been married These visions are not in line with what Ive understood about the Nightwatcher Renarin said Most consider her to be just some kind of powerful spren Once youve sought her out and been given your reward and your curse shes supposed to leave you alone When did you seek her Its been many years now Dalinar said Then this probably isnt due to her influence Renarin said I agree Dalinar said But what did you ask for Adolin said frowning My curse and boon are my own son Dalinar said The specifics are not important But I agree with Renarin Dalinar said interrupting This is probably not the Nightwatcher All right fine But why bring it up Because Adolin Dalinar said feeling exasperated I dont know what is happening to me These visions seem far too detailed to be products of my mind But your arguments made me think I could be wrong Or you could be wrong and it could be the Almighty Or it could be something entirely different We dont know and that is why it is dangerous for me to be left in command Well what I said still holds Adolin said stubbornly We can contain it No we cant Dalinar said Just because it has come only during highstorms in the past doesnt mean it couldnt expand to other times of stress What if I were struck with an episode on the battlefield That was the very same reason they didnt let Renarin ride into battle If that happens Adolin said well deal with it For now we could just ignore Dalinar threw a hand up into the air Ignore I can not ignore something like this The visions the book the things I feeltheyre changing every aspect of me How can I rule if I do not follow my conscience If I continue as highprince I secondguess my every decision Either I decide to trust myself or I step down I can not stomach the thought of something inbetween The room fell silent So what do we do Adolin said We make the choice Dalinar said I make the choice Step down or keep heeding the delusions Adolin spat Either way were letting them rule us And you have a better option Dalinar demanded Youve been quick to complain Adolin which seems a habit of yours But I dont see you offering a legitimate alternative I gave you one Adolin said Ignore the visions and move on I said a legitimate option The two stared at one another Dalinar fought to keep his anger contained In many ways he and Adolin were too similar They understood one another and that enabled them to push in places that hurt Well Renarin said what if we proved whether or not the visions were true Dalinar glanced at him What You say these dreams are detailed Renarin said leaning forward with hands clasped in front of him What exactly do you see Dalinar hesitated then gulped down the rest of his wine For once he wished he had intoxicating violet instead of orange The visions are often of the Knights Radiant At the end of each episode someoneI think one of the Heraldscomes to me and commands me to unite the highprinces of Alethkar The room fell silent Adolin looking disturbed Renarin just sitting quietly Today I saw the Day of Recreance Dalinar continued The Radiants abandoned their Shards and walked away The Plate and Bladesfaded somehow when they were abandoned It seems such an odd detail to have seen He looked at Adolin If these visions are fantasies then I am a great deal more clever than I once thought myself Do you remember any specifics we could check on Renarin asked Names Locations Events that might be traced in history This last one was of a place called Feverstone Keep Dalinar said Ive never heard of it Adolin said Feverstone Keep Dalinar repeated In my vision there was some kind of war going on near there The Radiants had been fighting on the front lines They withdrew to this fortress then abandoned their Shards there Perhaps we could find something in history Renarin said Proof that either this keep existed or that the Radiants didnt do what you saw there Then wed know wouldnt we If the dreams are delusions or truth Dalinar found himself nodding Proving them had never occurred to him in part because he had assumed they were real at the start Once hed started questioning hed been more inclined to keep the nature of the visions hidden and silent But if he knew that he was seeing real eventswell that would at least rule out the possibility of madness It wouldnt solve everything but it would help a great deal I dont know Adolin said more skeptical Father youre talking about times before the Hierocracy Will we be able to find anything in the histories There are histories from the time when the Radiants lived Renarin said Thats not as far back as the shadowdays or the Heraldic Epochs We could ask Jasnah Isnt this what she does As a Veristitalian Dalinar looked at Adolin It sounds like its worth a try son Maybe Adolin said But we cant take the existence of a single place as proof You could have heard of this Feverstone Keep and therefore included it Well Renarin said that may be true But if what Father sees are just delusions then certainly well be able to prove some parts of them untrue It seems impossible that every detail he imagines is one that he got from a story or history Some aspects of the delusions would have to be pure fancy Adolin nodded slowly IYoure right Renarin Yes its a good plan We need to get one of my scribes Dalinar said So I can dictate the vision I just had while it is fresh Yes Renarin said The more details we have the easier it will be to proveor disprovethe visions Dalinar grimaced setting aside his cup and walking over to the others He sat down All right but who would we use to record the dictation You have a great number of clerks Father Renarin said And theyre all either wife or daughter to one of my officers Dalinar said How could he explain It was painful enough for him to expose weakness to his sons If news of what he saw got around to his officers it could weaken morale There might come a time to reveal these things to his men but he would need to do so carefully And hed much rather know for himself whether or not he was mad before he approached others Yes Adolin said noddingthough Renarin still looked perplexed I understand But Father we cant afford to wait for Jasnah to return It could be months yet Agreed Dalinar said He sighed There was another option Renarin send a runner for your aunt Navani Adolin glanced at Dalinar raising an eyebrow Its a good idea But I thought you didnt trust her I trust her to keep her word Dalinar said resigned And to keep confidence I told her of my plans to abdicate and she didnt tell a soul Navani was excellent at keeping secrets Far better than the women of his court He trusted them to an extent but keeping a secret like this would require someone supremely exacting in their words and thoughts That meant Navani She would probably find a way to manipulate him using the knowledge but at least the secret would be safe from his men Go Renarin Dalinar said Renarin nodded and stood He had apparently recovered from his fit and walked surefooted to the door As he left Adolin approached Dalinar Father what will you do if we prove that Im right and its just your own mind A part of me wishes for that to happen Dalinar said watching the door swing closed after Renarin I fear madness but at least it is something familiar something that can be dealt with I will give you the princedom then seek help in Kharbranth But if these things are not delusions I face another decision Do I accept what they tell me or not It may very well be better for Alethkar if I prove to be mad It will be easier at the least Adolin considered that his brow furrowed his jaw tense And Sadeas He seems to be nearing the completion of his investigation What do we do It was a legitimate question Troubles over Dalinar trusting the visions in relation to Sadeas had been what had drawn Dalinar and Adolin to argument in the first place Unite them That wasnt just a command from the visions It had been Gavilars dream A unified Alethkar Had Dalinar let that dreamcombined with guilt over failing his brotherdrive him to construct supernatural rationalizations for seeking his brothers will He felt uncertain He hated feeling uncertain Very well Dalinar said I give you leave to prepare for the worst just in case Sadeas moves against us Prepare our officers and call back the companies sent to patrol for bandits If Sadeas denounces me as having tried to kill Elhokar we will lock down our warcamp and go on alert I dont intend to let him bring me in for execution Adolin looked relieved Thank you Father Hope it doesnt come to that son Dalinar said The moment Sadeas and I go to war in earnest Alethkar as a nation will shatter Ours are the two princedoms that uphold the king and if we turn to strife the others will either pick sides or turn to wars of their own Adolin nodded but Dalinar sat back disturbed Im sorry he thought to whatever force was sending the visions But I have to be wise In a way this seemed like a second test to him The visions had told him to trust Sadeas Well he would see what happened and then it faded Dalinar said After that I found myself back here Navani raised her pen looking thoughtful It hadnt taken him long to talk through the vision Shed scribed expertly picking out details from him knowing when to prod for more She hadnt said a thing about the irregularity of the request nor had she seemed amused by his desire to write down one of his delusions Shed been businesslike and careful She sat at his writing desk now hair bound up in curls and crossed with four hairspikes Her dress was red matched by her lip paint and her beautiful violet eyes were curious Stormfather Dalinar thought but shes beautiful Well Adolin asked He stood leaning against the door out of the chamber Renarin had gone off to collect a highstorm damage report The lad needed practice at that sort of activity Navani raised an eyebrow What was that Adolin What do you think Aunt Adolin asked I have never heard of any of these places or events Navani said But I believe you werent expecting to me to know of them Didnt you say you wished me to contact Jasnah Yes Adolin said But surely you have analysis I reserve judgment dear Navani said standing up and folding the paper by pressing down with her safehand holding it in place while she creased the fold tight She smiled walking by Adolin and patting him on the shoulder Lets see what Jasnah says before we do any analyzing shall we I suppose Adolin said He sounded dissatisfied I spent some time talking with that young lady of yours yesterday Navani noted to him Danlan I think youve made a wise choice Shes got a mind in that head of hers Adolin perked up You like her Quite a bit Navani said I also discovered that she is very fond of avramelons Did you know that I didnt actually Good I would have hated to do all that work to find you a means of pleasing her only to discover that you already knew it I took the liberty of purchasing a basket of the melons on my way here Youll find them in the antechamber watched over by a bored soldier who didnt look like he was doing anything important If you were to visit her with them this afternoon I think youd find yourself very well received Adolin hesitated He probably knew that Navani was deflecting him from worrying over Dalinar However he relaxed then started smiling Well that might make for a pleasant change considering events lately I thought it might Navani said Id suggest going soon those melons are perfectly ripe Besides I wish to speak with your father Adolin kissed Navani fondly on the cheek Thank you Mashala He allowed her to get away with some things that others could not around his favored aunt he was much like a child again Adolins smile widened as he made his way out the door Dalinar found himself smiling as well Navani knew his son well His smile didnt last long however as he realized that Adolins departure left him alone with Navani He stood up What is it you wished to ask of me he asked I didnt say I wanted to ask anything of you Dalinar she said I just wanted to talk We are family after all We dont spend enough time together If you wish to speak I shall fetch some soldiers to accompany us He glanced at the antechamber outside Adolin had shut the second door at the end closing off his view of his guardsand their view of him Dalinar she said walking up to him That would kind of defeat the point of sending Adolin away I was after some privacy He felt himself growing stiff You should go now Must I Yes People will think this is inappropriate They will talk You imply that something inappropriate could happen then Navani said sounding almost girlishly eager Navani you are my sister We arent related by blood she replied In some kingdoms a union between us would be mandated by tradition once your brother died We arent in other countries This is Alethkar There are rules I see she said strolling closer to him And what will you do if I dont go Will you call for help Have me hauled away Navani he said sufferingly Please Dont do this again Im tired Excellent That might make it easier to get what I want He closed his eyes I cant take this right now The vision the confrontation with Adolin his own uncertain emotionsHe didnt know what to make of things any longer Testing the visions was a good decision but he couldnt shake the disorientation he felt from being unable to decide what to do next He liked to make decisions and stick to them He couldnt do that It grated on him I thank you for your scribing and for your willingness to keep this quiet he said opening his eyes But I really must ask you to leave now Navani Oh Dalinar she said softly She was close enough that he could smell her perfume Stormfather but she was beautiful Seeing her brought to his mind thoughts of days long past when hed desired her so strongly that hed nearly grown to hate Gavilar for winning her affection Cant you just relax she asked him just for a little while The rules Everyone else I can not be everyone else Dalinar said more sharply than he intended If I ignore our code and ethics what am I Navani The other highprinces and lighteyes deserve recrimination for what they do and I have let them know it If I abandon my principles then I become something far worse than they A hypocrite She froze Please he said tense with emotion Just go Do not taunt me today She hesitated then walked away without a word She would never know how much he wished her to have made one more objection In his state he likely would have been unable to argue further Once the door shut he let himself sit down in his chair exhaling He closed his eyes Almighty above he thought Please Just let me know what I am to do He must pick it up the fallen title The tower the crown and the spear Dated Vevahach 1173 8 seconds predeath Subject a

focused wave Ten shafts struck the wood near Kaladins head their force throwing a shudder through it chips of wood splintering free But not a one struck flesh Across the chasm several of the Parshendi lowered their bows breaking off their chanting Their demonic faces bore looks of stupefaction Down Kaladin yelled as the bridge crew reached the chasm The ground was rough here covered in bulbous rockbuds Kaladin stepped on the vine from one of them causing the plant to retract The bridgemen heaved the bridge up and off their shoulders then expertly stepped aside lowering it to the ground Sixteen other bridge crews lined up with them setting their bridges down Behind Sadeass heavy cavalry thundered across the plateau toward them The Parshendi drew again Kaladin gritted his teeth throwing his weight against one of the wooden bars on the side helping shove the massive construction across the chasm He hated this part the bridgemen were so exposed Sadeass archers kept firing moving to a focused disruptive attack intended to force back the Parshendi As always the archers didnt seem to mind if they hit bridgemen and several of those shafts flew dangerously close to Kaladin He continued to pushsweating bleedingand felt a stab of pride for Bridge Four They were already beginning to move like warriors light on their feet moving erratically making it more difficult for the archers to draw a bead on them Would Gaz or Sadeass men notice The bridge thumped into place and Kaladin bellowed the retreat Bridgemen ducked out of the way dodging between thickshafted black Parshendi arrows and lighter greenfletched ones from Sadeass archers Moash and Rock hoisted themselves up onto the bridge and ran across it leaping down beside Kaladin Others scattered around the back of the bridge ducking in front of the oncoming cavalry charge Kaladin lingered waving for his men to get out of the way Once they were all free he glanced back at the bridge which bristled with arrows Not a single man down A miracle He turned to run Someone stumbled to his feet on the other side of the bridge Dunny The youthful bridgeman had a white and green fletched arrow sprouting from his shoulder His eyes were wide dazed Kaladin cursed running back Before hed taken two steps a blackhafted arrow took the youth in the other side He fell to the deck of the bridge blood spraying the dark wood The charging horses did not slow Frantic Kaladin reached the side of the bridge but something pulled him back Hands on his shoulder He stumbled spinning to find Moash there Kaladin snarled at him trying to shove the man aside but Moashusing a move Kaladin himself had taught himyanked Kaladin sideways tripping him Moash threw himself down holding Kaladin to the ground as heavy cavalry thundered across the bridge arrows cracking against their silvery armor Broken bits of arrow sprinkled to the ground Kaladin struggled for a moment but then let himself fall still Hes dead Moash said harshly Theres nothing you could have done Im sorry Theres nothing you could have done There isnt ever anything I can do Stormfather why cant I save them The bridge stopped shaking the cavalry smashing into the Parshendi and making space for the foot soldiers who clanked across next The cavalry would retreat after the foot soldiers gained purchase the horses too valuable to risk in extended fighting Yes Kaladin thought Think about the tactics Think about the battle Dont think about Dunny He pushed Moash off him rising Dunnys corpse was mangled beyond recognition Kaladin set his jaw and turned striding away without looking back He brushed past the watching bridgemen and stepped up to the lip of the chasm clasping his hands to his forearms behind his back feet spread It wasnt dangerous so long as he stood far down from the bridge The Parshendi had put away bows and were falling back The chrysalis was a towering oval stone mound on the far left side of the plateau Kaladin wanted to watch It helped him think like a soldier and thinking like a soldier helped him get over the deaths of those near him The other bridgemen tentatively approached and filled in around him standing at parade rest Even Shen the parshman joined them silently imitating the others Hed joined every bridge run so far without complaint He didnt refuse to march against his cousins he didnt try to sabotage the assault Gaz was disappointed but Kaladin wasnt surprised That was how parshmen were Except the ones on the other side of the chasm Kaladin stared at the fighting but had difficulty focusing on the tactics Dunnys death tore at him too much The lad had been a friend one of the first to support him one of the best of the bridgemen Each bridgeman dead edged them closer to disaster It would take weeks to train the men properly Theyd lose half of their numberperhaps even morebefore they were anywhere near ready to fight That wasnt good enough Well youll have to find a way to fix it Kaladin thought Hed made his decision and had no room for despair Despair was a luxury He broke parade rest and stalked away from the chasm The other bridgemen turned to look after him surprised Kaladin had recently taken to watching entire battles standing like that Sadeass soldiers had noticed Many saw it as bridgemen behaving above their station A few however seemed to respect Bridge Four for the display He knew there were rumors about him because of the storm these were adding to those Bridge Four followed and Kaladin led them across the rocky plateau He pointedly did not look again at the broken mangled body on the bridge Dunny had been one of the only bridgemen to retain any hint of innocence And now he was dead trampled by Sadeas struck by arrows from both sides Ignored forgotten abandoned There was nothing Kaladin could do for him So instead Kaladin made his way to where the members of Bridge Eight lay exhausted on a patch of open stone Kaladin remembered lying like that after his first bridge runs Now he barely felt winded As usual the other bridge crews had left their wounded behind as they retreated One poor man from Eight was crawling toward the others an arrow through his thigh Kaladin walked up to him He had dark brown skin and brown eyes his thick black hair pulled back into a long braided tail Painspren crawled around him He looked up with as Kaladin and the members of Bridge Four loomed over him Hold still Kaladin said softly kneeling and gently turning the man to get a good look at the wounded thigh Kaladin prodded at it thoughtful Teft well need a fire Get out your tinder Rock you still have my needle and thread Ill need that Wheres Lopen with the water The members of Bridge Four were silent Kaladin looked up from the confused wounded man Kaladin Rock said You know how the other bridge crews have treated us I dont care Kaladin said We dont have any money left Drehy said Even pooling our income we barely have enough for bandages for our own men I dont care If we care for the wounded of other bridge crews Drehy said shaking a blond head well have to feed them tend them I will find a way Kaladin said I Rock began Storm you Kaladin said standing and sweeping his hand over the plateau The bodies of bridgemen lay scattered ignored Look at that Who cares for them Not Sadeas Not their fellow bridgemen I doubt even the Heralds themselves spare a thought for these I wont stand there and watch while men die behind me We have to be better than that We cant look away like the lighteyes pretending we dont see This man is one of us Just like Dunny was The lighteyes talk about honor They spout empty claims about their nobility Well Ive only known one man in my life who was a true man of honor He was a surgeon who would help anyone even those who hated him Especially those who hated him Well were going to show Gaz and Sadeas Hashal and any other sodden fool who cares to watch what he taught me Now go to work and stop complaining Bridge Four stared at him with wide ashamed eyes then burst into motion Teft organized a triage unit sending some men to search for other wounded bridgemen and others to gather rockbud bark for a fire Lopen and Dabbid rushed off to fetch their litter Kaladin knelt down and felt at the wounded mans leg checking to see how quickly the blood leaked and determined that he wouldnt need to cauterize He broke the shaft and wiped the wound with some conicshell mucus for numbing Then he pulled the wood free eliciting a grunt and used his personal set of bandages to wrap the wound Hold this with your hands Kaladin instructed And dont walk on it Ill check on you before we march back to camp How the man said He didnt have even a hint of an accent Kaladin had expected him to be Azish because of the dark skin How will I get back if I cant walk on the leg We will carry you Kaladin said The man looked up obviously shocked I Tears formed in his eyes Thank you Kaladin nodded curtly turning as Rock and Moash brought over another wounded man Teft had a fire growing it smelled of pungent wet rockbud The new man had hit his head and had a long gash in his arm Kaladin held out a hand for his thread Kaladin lad Teft said with a soft voice handing him the thread and kneeling Now dont mark this as complaining because it aint But how many men can we really carry back with us Weve done three before Kaladin said Lashed to the top of the bridge Ill bet we could fit three more and carry another in the water litter And if we have more than seven If we bandage them right some might be able to walk And if there are still more Storm it Teft Kaladin said beginning to sew Then we bring the ones we can and haul the bridge back out again to fetch those we left behind Well bring Gaz with us if the soldiers worry that well run away Teft was silent and Kaladin steeled himself for incredulity Instead however the grizzled soldier smiled He actually seemed a little wateryeyed Keleks breath Its true I never thought Kaladin frowned looking up at Teft and holding a hand to the wound to stanch the bleeding What was that Oh nothing He scowled Get back to work That lad needs you Kaladin turned back to his sewing You still carrying a full pouch of spheres with you like I told you Teft asked I cant very well leave them behind in the barracks But well need to spend them soon Youll do nothing of the sort Teft said Those spheres are luck you hear me Keep them with you and always keep them infused Kaladin sighed I think theres something wrong with this batch They wont hold their Stormlight They fall dun after just a few days every time Perhaps its something to do with the Shattered Plains It has happened to the other bridgemen too Odd that Teft said rubbing his chin This was a bad approach Three bridges down Lots of bridgemen dead Interesting how we didnt lose anyone We lost Dunny But not on the approach You always run point and the arrows always seem to miss us Odd eh Kaladin looked up again frowning What are you saying Teft Nothing Get back to that sewing How many times do I have to tell you Kaladin raised an eyebrow but turned back to his work Teft had been acting very strange lately Was it the stress A lot of people were superstitious about spheres and Stormlight Rock and his team brought three more wounded then said that was all theyd found Bridgemen who fell often ended up like Dunny getting trampled Well at least Bridge Four wouldnt have to make a return trip to the plateau The three had bad arrow wounds and so Kaladin left the man with the gash on his arm to them instructing Skar to keep pressure on the unfinished sewing job Teft heated a dagger for cauterization these newcomers had obviously lost a lot of blood One probably wouldnt make it So much of the world is at war he thought as he worked The dream had highlighted what others already spoke of Kaladin hadnt known growing up in remote Hearthstone how fortunate his town had been to avoid battle The entire world warred and he struggled to save a few impoverished bridgemen What good did it do And yet he continued searing flesh sewing saving lives as his father had taught him He began to understand the sense of futility hed seen in his fathers eyes on those occasional darkened nights when Lirin had turned to his wine in solitude Youre trying to make up for failing Dunny Kaladin thought Helping these others wont bring him back He lost the one hed suspected would die but saved the other four and the one whod taken a knock to the head was beginning to wake up Kaladin sat back on his knees weary hands covered in blood He washed them off with a stream of water from Lopens waterskins then reached up finally remembering his own wound where the arrow had sliced his cheek He froze He prodded at his skin but couldnt find the wound He had felt blood on his cheek and chin Hed felt the arrow slice him hadnt he He stood up feeling a chill and raised his hand to his forehead What was happening Someone stepped up beside him Moashs nowcleanshaven face exposed a faded scar along his chin He studied Kaladin About Dunny You were right to do what you did Kaladin said You probably saved my life Thank you Moash nodded slowly He turned to look at the four wounded men Lopen and Dabbid were giving them drinks of water asking their names I was wrong about you Moash said suddenly holding out a hand to Kaladin Kaladin took the hand hesitant Thank you Youre a fool and an instigator But youre an honest one Moash chuckled to himself If you get us killed it wont be on purpose Cant say that for some Ive served under Anyway lets get these men ready for moving The burdens of nine become mine Why must I carry the madness of them all Oh Almighty release me Dated Palaheses 1173 unknown seconds predeath Subject a wealthy lighteyes Sample collected secondhand The cold night air threatened that a stretch of winter might soon be coming Dalinar wore a long thick uniform coat over trousers and shirt It buttoned stiffly up the chest and to the collar and was long in the back and on the sides coming down to his ankles flowing at the waist like a cloak In earlier years it might have been worn with a takama though Dalinar had never liked the skirtlike garments The purpose of the uniform was not fashion or tradition but to distinguish him easily for those who followed him He wouldnt have nearly the problem with the other lighteyes if they would at least wear their colors He stepped onto the kings feasting island Stands had been set up at the sides where the braziers normally stood each one bearing one of those new fabrials that gave off heat The stream between the islands had slowed to a trickle ice had stopped melting in the highlands Attendance at the feast tonight was small though that was mostly manifest on the four islands that were not the kings Where there was access to Elhokar and the highprinces people would attend even if the feast were held in the middle of a highstorm Dalinar walked down the central pathway and Navanisitting at a womens dining tablecaught his eyes She turned away perhaps still remembering his abrupt words to her at their last meeting Wit wasnt at his customary place insulting those who walked onto the kings island in fact he wasnt to be seen at all Not surprising Dalinar thought Wit didnt like to grow predictable hed spent several recent feasts on his pedestal doling out insults Likely he felt hed played out that tactic All nine other highprinces were in attendance Their treatment of Dalinar had grown stiff and cold since refusing his requests to fight together As if they were offended by the mere offer Lesser lighteyes made alliances but the highprinces were like kings themselves Other highprinces were rivals to be kept at arms length Dalinar sent a servant to fetch him food and sat down at the table His arrival had been delayed while he took reports from the companies hed called back so he was one of the last to eat Most of the others had turned to mingling To the right an officers daughter was playing a serene flute melody to a group of onlookers To the left three women had set up sketchpads and were each drawing the same man Women were known to challenge each other to duels in the way of men with Shardblades though they rarely used the word These were always friendly competitions or games of talent His food arrived steamed stagma brownish tuber that grew in deep puddlesatop a bed of boiled tallew The grain was puffed with water and the entire meal was drenched in a thick peppery brown gravy He slid out his knife and sliced a disk off the end of the stagm Using his knife to spread tallew over the top he grasped the vegetable disk between two fingers and began eat It had been prepared both spicy and hot this night probably because of the chill and tasted good as he chewed the steam from his plate fogging the air in front of him So far Jasnah had not replied regarding his vision though Navani claimed she might be able to find something on her own She was a renowned scholar herself though her interests had always been more in fabrials He glanced at her Was he a fool to off end her as he had Would it make her use the knowledge of his visions against him No he thought She wouldnt be that petty Navani did seem to care for him though her affection was inappropriate The chairs around him were left empty He was becoming a pariah first because of his talk of the Codes then because of his attempts to get the highprinces to work with him and finally because of Sadeass investigation No wonder Adolin was worried Suddenly someone slid right into the seat beside Dalinar wearing a black cloak against the chill It wasnt one of the highprinces Who would dare The figure lowered his hood revealing Wits hawklike face All lines and peaks with a sharp nose and jaw delicate eyebrows and keen eyes Dalinar sighed waiting for the inevitable stream of tooclever quips Wit however didnt speak He inspected the crowd his expression intense Yes Dalinar thought Adolin is right about this one too Dalinar himself had judged the man too harshly in the past He was not the fool some of his predecessors had been Wit continued in silence and Dalinar decided thatperhapsthe mans prank this night was to sit down beside people and unnerve them It wasnt much of a prank but Dalinar often missed the point of what Wit did Perhaps it was terribly clever if one had the mind for it Dalinar returned to his meal Winds are changing Wit whispered Dalinar glanced at him Wits eyes narrowed and he scanned the night sky Its been happening for months now A whirlwind Shifting and churning blowing us round and around Like a world spinning but we cant see it because were too much a part of it World spinning What foolishness is this The foolishness of men who care Dalinar Wit said And the brilliance of those who do not The second depend on the firstbut also exploit the firstwhile the first misunderstand the second hoping that the second are more like the first And all of their games steal our time Second by second Wit Dalinar said with a sigh I havent the mind for this tonight Im sorry if Im missing your intent but I have no idea what you mean I know Wit said then looked directly at him Adonalsium Dalinar frowned more deeply What Wit searched his face Have you ever heard the term Dalinar Adowhat Nothing Wit said He seemed preoccupied unlike his usual self Nonsense Balderdash Figgldygrak Isnt it odd that gibberish words are often the sounds of other words cut up and dismembered then stitched into something like themyet wholly unlike them at the same time Dalinar frowned I wonder if you could do that to a man Pull him apart emotion by emotion bit by bit bloody chunk by bloody chunk Then combine them back together into something else like a Dysian Aimian If you do put a man together like that Dalinar be sure to name him Gibberish after me Or perhaps Gibletish Is that your name then Your real name No my friend Wit said standing up Ive abandoned my real name But when next we meet Ill think of a clever one for you to call me Until then Wit will sufficeor if you must you may call me Hoid Watch yourself Sadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight though I know not what it is Farewell Im sorry I didnt insult you more Wait youre leaving I must I hope to return Ill do so if Im not killed Probably will anyway Apologize to your nephew for me He wont be happy Dalinar said Hes fond of you Yes its one of his more admirable traits Wit said Alongside that of paying me letting me eat his expensive food and giving me opportunity to make sport of his friends The cosmere unfortunately takes precedence over free food Watch yourself Dalinar Life becomes dangerous and youre at the center of it Wit nodded once then ducked into the night He put his hood up and soon Dalinar couldnt separate him from the darkness Dalinar turned back to his meal Sadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight though I know not what it is Wit was rarely wrongthough he was almost always odd Was he really leaving or would he still be in camp the next morning laughing at the prank he had played on Dalinar No Dalinar thought That wasnt a prank He waved over a masterservant in black and white Fetch my elder son for me The servant bowed and withdrew Dalinar ate the rest of his food in silence glancing occasionally at Sadeas and Elhokar They werent at the dining table any longer and so Sadeass wife had joined them Ialai was a curvaceous woman who reportedly dyed her hair That indicated foreign blood in her familys pastAlethi hair always bred true proportionate to how much Alethi blood you had Foreign blood would mean stray hairs of another color Ironically mixed blood was far more common in lighteyes than darkeyes Darkeyes rarely married foreigners but the Alethi houses often needed alliances or money from outside Food finished Dalinar stepped down from the kings table onto the island proper The woman was still playing her melancholy song She was quite good A few moments later Adolin strode onto the kings island He hurried over to Dalinar Father You sent for me Stay close Wit told me that Sadeas plans to make a storm of something tonight Adolins expression darkened Time to go then No We need to let this play out Father But you may prepare Dalinar said softly Just in case You invited officers of our guard to the feast tonight Yes Adolin said Six of them They have my further invitation to the kings island Pass the word What of the Kings Guard Ive made sure that some of the ones guarding the island tonight are among those most loyal to you Adolin nodded toward a space in the darkness to the side of the feasting basin I think we should position them over there Itll make a good line of retreat in case the king tries to have you arrested I still dont think it will come to that You cant be sure Elhokar allowed this investigation in the first place after all Hes growing more and more paranoid Dalinar glanced over at the king The younger man almost always wore his Shardplate these days though he didnt have it on now He seemed continually on edge glancing over his shoulder eyes darting from side to side Let me know when the men are in position Dalinar said Adolin nodded walking away quickly The situation gave Dalinar little stomach for mingling Still standing alone and looking awkward was no better so he made his way to where Highprince Hatham was speaking with a small group of lighteyes beside the main firepit They nodded to Dalinar as he joined them regardless of the way they were treating him in general they would never turn him away at a feast like this That simply wasnt done to one of his rank Ah Brightlord Dalinar Hatham said in his smooth overly polite way The longnecked slender man wore a ruffled green shirt underneath a robelike coat with a darker green silk scarf around the neck A faintly glowing ruby sat on each of his fingers theyd each had some of their Stormlight drained away by a fabrial made for the purpose Of Hathams four companions two were lesser lighteyes and one was a short whiterobed ardent Dalinar didnt know The last was a redgloved Natan man with bluish skin and stark white hair two locks dyed a deep red and braided down to hang alongside his cheeks He was a visiting dignitary Dalinar had seen him at the feasts What was his name again Tell me Brightlord Dalinar Hatham said Have you been paying much attention to the conflict between the Tukari and the Emuli Its a religious conflict isnt it Dalinar asked Both were Makabaki kingdoms on the southern coast where trade was plentiful and profitable Religious the Natan man said No I wouldnt say that All conflicts are essentially economic in nature Aunak Dalinar recalled Thats his name He spoke with an airy accent overextending all of his ah and oh sounds Money is behind every war Aunak continued Religion is but an excuse Or perhaps a justification Theres a difference the ardent said obviously taking offense at Aunaks tone Of course Aunak said An excuse is what you make after the deed is done while a justification is what you offer before I would say an excuse is something you claim but do not believe Nakali Hatham was using the high form of Aunaks name While a justification is something you actually believe Why such respect The Natan must have something that Hatham wanted Regardless Aunak said This particular war is over the city of Sesemalex Dar which the Emuli have made their capital Its an excellent trade city and the Tukari want it Ive heard of Sesemalex Dar Dalinar said rubbing his chin The city is quite spectacular filling rifts cut into the stone Indeed Aunak said Theres a particular composition of the stone there that lets water drain The design is amazing Its obviously one of the Dawncities My wife would have something to say on that Hatham said She makes the Dawncities her study The citys pattern is central to the Emuli religion the ardent said They claim it is their ancestral homeland a gift to them from the Heralds And the Tukari are led by that godpriest of theirs Tezim So the conflict is religious in nature And if the city werent such a fantastic port Aunak said would they be as persistent about proclaiming the citys religious significance I think not Theyre pagans after all so we cant presume their religion has any real importance Talk of the Dawncities had been popular lately among the lighteyesthe idea that certain cities could trace their origins back to the Dawnsingers Perhaps Have any of you heard of a place known as Feverstone Keep Dalinar asked The others shook their heads even Aunak had nothing to say Why Hatham asked Just curious The conversation continued though Dalinar let his attention wander back toward Elhokar and his circle of attendants When would Sadeas make his announcement If he intended to suggest that Dalinar be arrested he wouldnt do it at a feast would he Dalinar forced his attention back to the conversation He really should pay more heed to what was happening in the world Once news of which kingdoms were in conflict had fascinated him So much had changed since the visions began Perhaps its not economic or religious in nature Hatham said trying to bring an end to the argument Everyone knows that the Makabaki tribes have odd hatreds of one another Perhaps Aunak said Does it matter Dalinar asked The others turned to him Its just another war If they werent fighting one another theyd find others to attack Its what we do Vengeance honor riches religionthe reasons all just produce the same result The others fell still the silence quickly growing awkward Which devotary do you credit Brightlord Dalinar Hatham asked thoughtful as if trying to remember something hed forgotten The Order of Talenelat Ah Hatham said Yes it makes sense They do hate arguing over religion You must find this discussion terribly boring A safe out from the conversation Dalinar smiled nodding in thanks to Hathams politeness The Order of Talenelat Aunak said I always considered that a devotary for the lesser people This from a Natan the Ardent said stuffily My family has always been devoutly Vorin Yes the ardent replied conveniently so since your family has used its Vorin ties to trade favorably in Alethkar One wonders if you are equally devout when not standing on our soil I dont have to be insulted like this Aunak snapped He turned and strode way causing Hatham to raise a hand Nakali Hatham called rushing after him anxiously Please ignore him Insufferable bore the ardent said softly taking a sip of his wineorange of course as he was a man of the clergy Dalinar frowned at him You are bold ardent he said sternly Perhaps foolishly so You insult a man Hatham wants to do business with Actually I belong to Brightlord Hatham the ardent said He asked me to insult his guestBrightlord Hatham wants Aunak to think that he is shamed Now when Hatham agrees quickly to Aunaks demands the foreigner will assume it was because of thisand wont delay the contract signing out of suspicion that it is proceeding too easily Ah of course Dalinar looked after the fleeing pair They go to such lengths Considering that what was Dalinar to think of Hathams politeness earlier when he had given Dalinar a reason to explain his apparent distaste for conflict Was Hatham preparing Dalinar for some covert manipulation The ardent cleared his throat I would appreciate it if you did not repeat to anyone what I just told you Brightlord Dalinar noticed Adolin returning to the kings island accompanied by six of Dalinars officers in uniform and wearing their swords Why did you tell me in the first place then Dalinar asked turning his attention back to the whiterobed man Just as Hatham wishes his partner in negotiations to know of his goodwill I wish you to know of our goodwill toward you Brightlord Dalinar frowned Hed never had much to do with the ardentshis devotary was simple and straightforward Dalinar got his fill of politics with the court he had little desire to find more in religion Why What should it matter if I have goodwill toward you The ardent smiled We will speak with you again He bowed low and withdrew Dalinar was about to demand more but Adolin arrived looking after Highprince Hatham What was that all about Dalinar just shook his head Ardents werent supposed to engage in politics whatever their devotary Theyd been officially forbidden to do so since the Hierocracy But as with most things in life the ideal and the reality were two separate things The lighteyes couldnt help but use the ardents in their schemes and somore and morethe devotaries found themselves a part of the court Father Adolin asked The men are in place Good Dalinar said He set his jaw and then crossed the small island He would see this fiasco finished with once and for all He passed the firepit a wave of dense heat making the left side of his face prickle with sweat while the right side was still chilled by the autumn cold Adolin hurried up to walk by him hand on his side sword Father What are we doing Being provocative Dalinar said striding right up to where Elhokar and Sadeas were chatting Their crowd of sycophants reluctantly parted for Dalinar and I think that The king cut off glancing at Dalinar Yes Uncle Sadeas Dalinar said What is the status of your investigation of the cut girth strap Sadeas blinked He held a cup of violet wine in his right hand his long red velvet robe open at the front to expose a ruffled white shirt Dalinar are you Your investigation Sadeas Dalinar said firmly Sadeas sighed looking at Elhokar Your Majesty I was actually planning to make an announcement regarding this very subject tonight I was going to wait until later but if Dalinar is going to be so insistent I am Dalinar said Oh go ahead Sadeas the king said You have me curious now The king waved to a servant who rushed to quiet the flutist while another servant tapped the chimes to call for silence In moments the people on the island stilled Sadeas gave Dalinar a grimace that somehow conveyed the message You demanded this old friend Dalinar folded his arms keeping his gaze fixed on Sadeas His six Cobalt Guardsmen stepped up behind him and Dalinar noticed that a group of similar lighteyed officers from Sadeass warcamp were listening nearby Well I wasnt planning to have such an audience Sadeas said Mostly this was planned for Your Majesty only Unlikely Dalinar thought trying to suppress his anxiety What would he do if Adolin was right and Sadeas charged him with trying to assassinate Elhokar It would indeed be the end of Alethkar Dalinar would not go quietly and the warcamps would turn against one another The nervous peace that had held them together for the last decade would come to an end Elhokar would never be able to hold them together Also if it turned to battle Dalinar would not fare well The others were alienated from him hed have enough trouble facing Sadeasif several of the others joined against him he would fall horribly outnumbered He could see now Adolin thought it an incredible act of foolishness to have listened to the visions And yet in a powerfully surreal moment Dalinar felt that hed done the correct thing Hed never felt it as strongly as at that moment preparing to be condemned Sadeas dont weary me with your sense of drama Elhokar said Theyre listening Im listening Dalinar looks like hes ready to burst a vein in his forehead Speak Very well Sadeas said giving his wine to a servant My very first task as Highprince of Information was to discover the true nature of the attempt on His Majestys life during the greatshell hunt He waved a hand motioning to one of his men who hurried away Another stepped forward handing Sadeas the broken leather strap I took this strap to three separate leatherworkers in three different warcamps Each came to the same conclusion It was cut The leather is relatively new and has been well cared for as proven by the lack of cracking and flaking in other areas The tear is too even Someone slit it Dalinar felt a sense of dread That was near what he had discovered but it was presented in the worst possible light For what purpose Dalinar began Sadeas held up a hand Please Highprince First you demand I report then you interrupt me Dalinar fell still Around them more and more of the important lighteyes were gathering He could sense their tension But when was it cut Sadeas said turning to address the crowd He did have a flair for the dramatic That was pivotal you see I took leave to interview numerous men who were on that hunt None reported seeing anything specific though all remembered that there was one odd event The time when Brightlord Dalinar and His Majesty raced to a rock formation A time when Dalinar and the king were alone There were whispers from behind There was a problem however Sadeas said One Dalinar himself raised Why cut the strap on a Shardbearers saddle A foolish move A horseback fall wouldnt be of much danger to a man wearing Shardplate To the side the servant Sadeas had sent away returned leading a youth with sandy hair bearing only a few hints of black Sadeas fished something out of a pouch at his waist holding it up A large sapphire It wasnt infused In fact looking closely Dalinar could see that it was crackedit wouldnt hold Stormlight now The question drove me to investigate the kings Shardplate Sadeas said Eight of the ten sapphires used to infuse his Plate were cracked following the battle It happens Adolin said stepping up beside Dalinar hand on his side sword You lose a few in every battle But eight Sadeas asked One or two is normal But have you ever lost eight in one battle before young Kholin Adolins only reply was a glare Sadeas tucked away the gemstone nodding to the youth his men had brought This is one of the grooms in the kings employ Fin isnt it YYes brightlord the boy stammered He couldnt be older than twelve What is it you told me earlier Fin Please say it again so that all may hear The darkeyed youth cringed looking sick Well Brightlord sir it was just this Everyone spoke of the saddle being checked over in Brightlord Dalinars camp And I suppose it was right as that But Im the one who prepared His Majestys horse afore it was turned over to Brightlord Dalinars men And I did it I promise I did Put on his favorite saddle and everything But Dalinars heart raced He had to hold himself back from summoning his Blade But what Sadeas said to Fin But when the kings head grooms took the horse past on its way to the Highprince Dalinars camp it was wearing a different saddle I swear it Several of those standing around them seemed confused by this admission Aha Adolin said pointing But that happened in the kings palace complex Indeed Sadeas said raising an eyebrow at Adolin How keenminded of you young Kholin This discoverymixed with the cracked gemstonesmeans something I suspect that whoever attempted to kill His Majesty planted in his Shardplate flawed gemstones that would crack when strained losing their Stormlight Then they weakened the saddle girth with a careful slit The hope would be that His Majesty would fall while fighting a greatshell allowing it to attack him The gemstones would fail the Plate would break and His Majesty would fall to an accident while hunting Sadeas raised a finger as the crowd began to whisper again However it is important to realize that these eventsthe switching of the saddle or the planting of the gemstonesmust have happened before His Majesty met up with Dalinar I feel that Dalinar is a very unlikely suspect In fact my present guess is that the culprit is someone that Brightlord Dalinar has offended that someone wanted us all to think he might be involved It may not have actually been intended to kill His Majesty just to cast suspicion upon Dalinar The island fell silent even the whispers dying Dalinar stood stunned II was right Adolin finally broke the quiet What All evidence points to your father being innocent Adolin Sadeas said sufferingly You find this surprising No but Adolins brow furrowed Around them the lighteyes began talking sounding disappointed They began to disperse Dalinars officers remained standing behind him as if expecting a surprise strike Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought What does it mean Sadeas waved for his men to take the groom away then nodded to Elhokar and withdrew in the direction of the evening trays where warmed wine sat in pitchers next to toasted breads Dalinar caught up to Sadeas as the shorter man was filling a small plate Dalinar took him by the arm the fabric of Sadeass robe soft beneath his fingers Sadeas looked at him raising an eyebrow Thank you Dalinar said quietly For not going through with it Behind them the flutist resumed her playing For not going through with what Sadeas said setting down his small plate then prying Dalinars fingers free I had hoped to make this presentation after Id discovered more concrete proof that you werent involved Unfortunately pressed as I was the best I could do was to indicate that it was unlikely you were involved There will still be rumors Im afraid Wait You wanted to prove me innocent Sadeas scowled picking up his plate again Do you know what your problem is Dalinar Why everyone has begun finding you so tiresome Dalinar didnt reply The presumption Youve grown despicably selfrighteous Yes I asked Elhokar for this position so I could prove you innocent Is it so storming difficult for you to believe someone else in this army might do something honest I Dalinar said Of course it is Sadeas said Youve been looking down on us like a man standing atop a single sheet of paper who therefore thinks himself so high as to see for miles Well I think that book of Gavilars is crem and the Codes are lies people pretended to follow so that they could justify their shriveled consciences Damnation Ive got one of those shriveled consciences myself But I didnt want to see you maligned for this bungled attempt to kill the king If youd wanted him dead youd have just burned out his eyes and been done with it Sadeas took a drink of his steaming violet wine The problem is Elhokar kept on and on about that blasted strap And people started talking since he was under your protection and you two rode off together like that Stormfather only knows how they could think you would try to have Elhokar assassinated You can barely bring yourself to kill Parshendi these days Sadeas stuffed a small piece of toasted bread in his mouth then moved to walk away Dalinar caught him by the arm again II owe you a debt I shouldnt have treated you as I have these six years Sadeas rolled his eyes chewing his bread This wasnt for you alone So long as everyone thought you were behind the attempt nobody would figure out who really tried to have Elhokar killed And someone did Dalinar I dont accept eight gemstones cracking in one fight The strap alone would have been a ridiculous way to attempt an assassination but with weakened ShardplateIm half tempted to believe that the surprise arrival of the chasmfiend was orchestrated too How someone would manage that though I have no idea And the talk of me being framed Dalinar asked Mostly to give the others something to gossip about while I sort through whats really happening Sadeas looked down at Dalinars hand on his arm Would you let go Dalinar released his grip Sadeas set down his plate straightening his robe and dusting off the shoulder I havent give up on you yet Dalinar Im probably going to need you before this is all through I do have to say though I dont know what to make of you lately That talk of you wanting to abandon the Vengeance Pact Is there any truth to that I mentioned it in confidence to Elhokar as a means of exploring options So yes theres truth to it if you must know Im tired of this fighting Im tired of these Plains of being away from civilization of killing Parshendi a handful at a time However Ive given up on getting us to retreat Instead I want to win But the highprinces wont listen They all assume that Im trying to dominate them with some crafty trick Sadeas snorted Youd sooner punch a man in the face than stab him in the back Blessedly straightforward Ally with me Dalinar said after him Sadeas froze You know Im not going to betray you Sadeas Dalinar said You trust me as the others never can Try what Ive been trying to get the other highprinces to agree to Jointly assault plateaus with me Wont work Sadeas said Theres no reason to bring more than one army on an assault I leave half my troops behind each time as it is There isnt room for more to maneuver Yes but think Dalinar said What if we tried new tactics Your quick bridge crews are fast but my troops are stronger What if you pushed quickly to a plateau with an advance force to hold off the Parshendi You could hold until my stronger but slower forces arrive That gave Sadeas pause It could mean a Shardblade Sadeas Sadeass eyes grew hungry I know youve fought Parshendi Shardbearers Dalinar said seizing on that thread But youve lost Without a Blade youre at a disadvantage Parshendi Shardbearers had a habit of escaping after entering battles Regular spearmen couldnt kill one of course It took a Shardbearer to kill a Shardbearer Ive slain two in the past I dont often have the opportunity however because I cant get to the plateaus quickly enough You can Together we can win more often and I can get you a Blade We can do this Sadeas Together Like the old days The old days he said idly Id like to see the Blackthorn in battle again How would we split the gemhearts Twothirds to you Dalinar said As youve got twice as good a record at winning assaults as I have Sadeas looked thoughtful And the Shardblades If we find a Shardbearer Adolin and I will take him You win the Blade He raised a finger But I win the Plate To give to my son Renarin The invalid What would you care Dalinar said You already have Plate Sadeas this could mean winning the war If we start to work together we could bring the others in prepare for a largescale assault Storms We might not even need that We two have the largest armies if we could find a way to catch the Parshendi on a large enough plateau with the bulk of our troopssurrounding them so they couldnt escapewe might be able to damage their forces enough to bring an end to this all Sadeas mulled it over Then he shrugged Very well Send me details via messenger But do it later Ive already missed too much of tonights feast A woman sits and scratches out her own eyes Daughter of kings and winds the vandal Dated Palahevan 1173 73 seconds predeath Subject a beggar of some renown known for his elegant songs One week after losing Dunny Kaladin stood on another plateau watching a battle proceed This time however he didnt have to save the dying Theyd actually arrived before the Parshendi A rare but welcome event Sadeass army was now holding out at the center of the plateau protecting the chrysalis while some of his soldiers cut into it The Parshendi kept leaping over the line and attacking the men working on the chrysalis Hes getting surrounded Kaladin thought It didnt look good which would mean a miserable return trip Sadeass men were bad enough when arriving second they were rebuffed Losing the gemheart after arriving firstwould leave them even more frustrated Kaladin a voice said Kaladin spun to see Rock trotting up Was someone wounded Have you seen this thing The Horneater pointed Kaladin turned following his gesture Another army was approaching on an adjacent plateau Kaladin raised eyebrows the banners flapped blue and the soldiers were obviously Alethi A little late arent they Moash asked standing beside Kaladin It happens Kaladin said Occasionally another highprince would arrive after Sadeas got to the plateau More often Sadeas arrived first and the other Alethi army had to turn around Usually they didnt get this close before doing so Thats the standard of Dalinar Kholin Skar said joining them Dalinar Moash said appreciatively They say he doesnt use bridgemen How does he cross the chasms then Kaladin asked The answer soon became obvious This new army had enormous siegetowerlike bridges pulled by chulls They rumbled across the uneven plateaus often having to pick their way around rifts in the stone They must be terribly slow Kaladin thought But in trade the army wouldnt have to approach the chasm while being fired on They could hide behind those bridges Dalinar Kholin Moash said They say hes a true lighteyes like the men from the old days A man of honor and of oaths Kaladin snorted Ive seen plenty of lighteyes with that same reputation and Ive been disappointed by them every time Ill tell you about Brightlord Amaram sometime Amaram Skar asked The Shardbearer Youve heard of that Kaladin asked Sure Skar said Hes supposed to be on his way here Everyones talking about it in the taverns Were you with him when he won his Shards No Kaladin said softly Nobody was Dalinar Kholins army approached across the plateau to the south Amazingly Dalinars army came right up to the battlefield plateau Hes attacking Moash said scratching his head Maybe he figures that Sadeas will lose and wants to take a stab at it after he retreats No Kaladin said frowning Hes joining the battle The Parshendi army sent over some archers to fire on Dalinars army but their arrows bounced off the chulls without causing any harm A group of soldiers unhooked the bridges and pushed them into place while Dalinars archers set up and exchanged fire with the Parshendi Does it seem Sadeas took fewer soldiers with him this run Sigzil asked joining the group watching Dalinars army Perhaps he planned for this Could be why he was willing to commit like he did letting himself get surrounded The bridges could be cranked to lower and extend there was some marvelous engineering at work As they began to work something decidedly strange happened Two Shardbearers likely Dalinar and his son leaped across the chasm and began attacking the Parshendi The distraction let the soldiers get the large bridges into place and some heavy cavalry charged across to help It was a completely different method of doing a bridge assault and Kaladin found himself considering the implications He really is joining the battle Moash said I think theyre going to work together Its bound to be more effective Kaladin said Im surprised they havent tried it before Teft snorted Thats because you dont understand how lighteyes think Highprinces dont just want to win the battle they want to win it by themselves I wish Id been recruited in his army instead Moash said almost reverent The soldiers armor gleamed their ranks obviously wellpracticed Dalinarthe Blackthornhad done an even better job than Amaram at cultivating a reputation for honesty People knew of him all the way back in Hearthstone but Kaladin understood the kinds of corruption a wellpolished breastplate could hide Though he thought that man who protected the whore on the street he wore blue Adolin Dalinars son He seemed genuinely selfless in his defense of the woman Kaladin set his jaw casting aside those thoughts He would not be taken in again He would not The fighting grew brutal for a short time but the Parshendi were overwhelmedsmashed between two opposing forces Soon Kaladins team led a victorious group of soldiers back to the camps for celebration Kaladin rolled the sphere between his fingers The otherwise pure glass had cooled with a thin line of bubbles permanently frozen along one side The bubbles were tiny spheres of their own catching light He was on chasm scavenging duty Theyd gotten back from the plateau assault so quickly that Hashal in defiance of logic or mercy had sent them down into the chasm that very day Kaladin continued to turn the sphere in his fingers Hanging in the very center of it was a large emerald cut in a round shape with dozens of tiny facets along the sides A small rim of suspended bubbles clung to the side of gemstone as if longing to be near its brilliance Bright crystalline green Stormlight shone from inside the glass lighting Kaladins fingers An emerald broam the highest denomination of sphere Worth hundreds of lesser spheres To bridgemen this was a fortune A strangely distant one for spending it was impossible Kaladin thought he could see some of the storms tempest inside that rock The light was likeit was like part of the storm captured by the emerald The light wasnt perfectly steady it just seemed that way compared with the flickering of candles torches or lamps Holding it close Kaladin could see the light swirling raging What do we do with it Moash asked from Kaladins side Rock stood at Kaladins other side The sky was overcast making it darker than usual here at the bottom The cold weather of late had drawn back to spring though it was uncomfortably chilly The men worked efficiently quickly gathering spears armor boots and spheres from the dead Because of the short time given themand because of the exhausting bridge run earlierKaladin had decided to forgo spear practice for the day Theyd load up on salvage instead and stow some of it down beneath to be used for avoiding punishment next time As theyd worked theyd found a lighteyed officer He had been quite wealthy This single emerald broam was worth what a bridgeman slave would make in two hundred days In the same pouch with it theyd found a collection of chips and marks that totaled slightly more than another emerald broam Wealth A fortune Simply pocket change to a lighteyes With this we could feed those wounded bridgemen for months Moash said We could buy all the medical supplies we could want Stormfather We could probably bribe the camps perimeter guards to let us sneak away This thing will not happen Rock said Is impossible to get spheres out of the chasms We could swallow them Moash said You would choke Spheres are too big eh Ill bet I could do it Moash said His eyes glittered reflecting the verdant Stormlight Thats more money than Ive ever seen Its worth the risk Swallowing wont work Kaladin said You think those guards who watch us in the latrines are there to keep us from fleeing Ill bet some sodden parshman has to go through our droppings and Ive seen them keep record of who visits and how often We arent the first to think of swallowing spheres Moash hesitated then sighed crestfallen Youre probably right Storm you but you are But we cant just give it to them can we Yes we can Kaladin said closing his fist around the sphere The glow was bright enough to make his hand shine Wed never be able to spend it A bridgeman with a full broam It would give us away But Moash began We give it to them Moash Then he held up the pouch containing the other spheres But we find a way to keep these Rock nodded Yes If we give up this expensive sphere they will think us honest eh It will disguise the theft and they will even give us small reward But how can we do this thing keeping the pouch Im working on that Kaladin said Work fast then Moash said glancing at Kaladins torch rammed between two rocks at the side of the chasm Well need to head back up soon Kaladin opened his hand and rolled the emerald sphere between his fingers How Have you ever seen anything so beautiful Moash asked staring at the emerald Its just a sphere Kaladin said absently A tool I once held a goblet full of a hundred diamond broams and was told they were mine Since I never got to spend them they were as good as worthless A hundred diamonds Moash asked Wherehow Kaladin closed his mouth cursing himself I shouldnt keep mentioning things like that Go on he said tucking the emerald broam back into the black pouch We need to be quick Moash sighed but Rock thumped him on the back goodnaturedly and they joined the rest of the bridgemen Rock and Lopenusing Syls directionshad led them to a large mass of corpses in redandbrown uniforms He didnt know which highprinces men they were but the bodies were pretty fresh There were no Parshendi among them Kaladin glanced to the side where Shenthe parshman bridgemanworked Quiet obedient stalwart Teft still didnt trust him A part of Kaladin was glad for that Syl landed on the wall beside him standing with her feet planted against the surface and looking up at the sky Think Kaladin told himself How do we keep these spheres There has to be a way But each possibility seemed too much of a risk If they were caught stealing theyd probably be given a different work detail Kaladin wasnt willing to risk that Silent green lifespren began to fade into existence around him bobbing around the moss and haspers A few frillblooms opened up fronds of red and yellow beside his head Kaladin had thought again and again about Dunnys death Bridge Four was not safe True theyd lost a remarkably small number of men lately but they were still dwindling And each bridge run was a chance for total disaster All it took was one time with the Parshendi focusing on them Lose three or four men and theyd topple The waves of arrows would redouble cutting every one of them down It was the same old problem the one Kaladin had beaten his head against day after day How did you protect bridgemen when everyone wanted them exposed and endangered Hey Sig Maps said walking by carrying an armload of spears Youre a Worldsinger right Maps had grown increasingly friendly in the last few weeks and had proven good at getting the others talking The balding man reminded Kaladin of an innkeeper always quick to make his patrons feel at ease Sigzilwho was pulling the boots off a line of corpsesgave Kaladin a straightlipped glance that seemed to say This is your fault He didnt like that others had discovered he was a Worldsinger Why dont you give us a tale Maps said setting down his armload Help us pass the time I am not a foolish jester or storyteller Sigzil said yanking off a boot I do not give tales I spread knowledge of cultures peoples thoughts and dreams I bring peace through understanding It is the holy charge my order received from the Heralds themselves Well why not start spreading then Maps said standing and wiping his hands on his trousers Sigzil signed audibly Very well What is it you wish to hear about I dont know Something interesting Tell us about Brightking Alazansi and the hundredship fleet Leyten called I am not a storyteller Sigzil repeated I speak of nations and peoples not tavern stories I Is there a place where people live in gouges in the ground Kaladin said A city built in an enormous complex of lines all set into the rock as if carved there Sesemalex Dar Sigzil said nodding pulling off another boot Yes it is the capital of the kingdom of Emul and is one of the most ancient cities in the world It is said that the cityand indeed the kingdomwere named by Jezrien himself Jezrien Malop said standing and scratching his head Whos that Malop was a thickhaired fellow with a bushy black beard and a glyphward tattoo on each hand He also wasnt the brightest sphere in the goblet so to speak You call him the Stormfather here in Alethkar Sigzil said Or JezerezehElin He was king of the Heralds Master of the storms bringer of water and life known for his fury and his temper but also for his mercy Oh Malop said Tell me more of the city Kaladin said Sesemalex Dar It is indeed built in giant troughs The pattern is quite amazing It protects against highstorms as each trough has a lip at the side keeping water from streaming in off the stone plain around it That mixed with a drainage system of cracks protects the city from flooding The people there are known for their expert crem pottery the city is a major waypoint in the southwest The Emuli are a certain tribe of the Askarki people and theyre ethnically Makabakidarkskinned like myself Their kingdom borders my own and I visited there many times in my youth It is a wondrous place filled with exotic travelers Sigzil grew more relaxed as he continued to talk Their legal system is very lenient toward foreigners A man who is not of their nationality can not own a home or shop but when you visit you are treated as a relative who has traveled from afar to be shown all kindness and leniency A foreigner can take dinner at any residence he calls upon assuming he is respectful and offers a gift of fruit The people are most interested in exotic fruits They worship Jezrien though they dont accept him as a figure from the Vorin religion They name him the only god The Heralds arent gods Teft scoffed To you they arent Sigzil said Others regard them differently The Emuli have what your scholars like to call a splinter religioncontaining some Vorin ideas But to the Emuli you would be the splinter religion Sigzil seemed to find that amusing though Teft just scowled Sigzil continued in more and more detail talking of the flowing gowns and headwraps of the Emuli women the robes favored by the men The taste of the foodsaltyand the way of greeting an old friendby holding the left forefinger to the forehead and bowing in respect Sigzil knew an impressive amount about them Kaladin noticed him smiling wistfully at times probably recalling his travels The details were interesting but Kaladin was more taken aback by the fact that this citywhich he had flown over in his dream weeks agowas actually real And he could no longer ignore the strange speed at which he recovered from wounds Something odd was happening to him Something supernatural What if it was related to the fact that everyone around him always seemed to die He knelt down to begin rifling the pockets of the dead men a duty the other bridgemen avoided Spheres knives and other useful objects were kept Personal mementoes like unburned prayers were left with the bodies He found a few zircon chips which he added to the pouch Maybe Moash was right If they could get this money out could they bribe their way free of the camp That would certainly be safer than fighting So why was he so insistent on teaching the bridgemen to fight Why hadnt he given any thought to sneaking the bridgemen out He had lost Dallet and the others of his original squad in Amarams army Did he think to compensate for that by training a new group of spearmen Was this about saving men hed grown to love or was it just about proving something to himself His experience told him that men who could not fight were at a severe disadvantage in this world of war and storms Perhaps sneaking out would have been the better option but he knew little of stealth Besides if they sneaked away Sadeas would send troops after them Trouble would track them down Whatever their path the bridgemen would have to kill to remain free He squeezed his eyes shut remembering one of his escape attempts when hed kept his fellow slaves free for an entire week hiding in the wilderness Theyd finally been caught by their masters hunters That was when hed lost Nalma None of that has to do with saving them here and now Kaladin told himself I need these spheres Sigzil was still talking about the Emuli To them the Worldsinger said the need to strike a man personally is crass They wage war in the opposite way from you Alethi The sword is not a weapon for a leader A halberd is better then a spear and best of all a bow and arrow Kaladin pulled another handful of spheresskychipsfrom a soldiers pocket They were stuck to an aged hunk of sows cheese fragrant and moldy He grimaced picking the spheres out and washing them in a puddle Spears used by lighteyes Drehy said Thats ridiculous Why Sigzil said sounding offended I find the Emuli way to be interesting In some countries it is seen as displeasing to fight at all To the Shin for instance if you must fight a man then you have already failed Killing is at best a brutish way of solving problems Youre not going be like Rock and refuse to fight are you Skar asked shooting a barelyveiled glare at the Horneater Rock sniffed and turned his back on the shorter man kneeling down to shove boots into a large sack No Sigzil said I think we can all agree that other methods have failed Perhaps if my master knew I still livedbut no That is foolish Yes I will fight And if I have to the spear seems a favorable weapon though I honestly would prefer to put more distance between myself and my enemies Kaladin frowned You mean with a bow Sigzil nodded Among my people the bow is a noble weapon Do you know how to use one Alas no Sigzil said I would have mentioned it before now if I had such proficiency Kaladin stood up opening the pouch and depositing the spheres in with the others Were there any bows among the bodies The men glanced at each other several of them shaking heads Storm it Kaladin thought The seed of an idea had begun to sprout in his mind but that killed it Gather up some of those spears he said Set them aside Well need them for training But we have to turn them in Malop said Not if we dont take them with us up out of the chasm Kaladin said Each time we come scavenging well save a few spears and stash them down here It shouldnt take long to gather enough to practice with How will we get them out when its time to escape Teft asked rubbing his chin Spears left down here wont do these lads much good once the real fighting starts Ill find a way to get them up Kaladin said You say things like that a lot Skar noted Leave off Skar Moash said He knows what hes doing Kaladin blinked Had Moash just defended him Skar flushed I didnt mean it like that Kaladin Im just asking thats all I understand Its Kaladin trailed off as Syl flitted down into the chasm in the form of a curling ribbon She landed on a rock outcropping on the wall taking on her female form I found another group of bodies Theyre mostly Parshendi Any bows Kaladin asked Several of the bridgemen gawked at him until they saw him staring into the air Then they nodded knowingly to one another I think so Syl said Its just down this way Not too far The bridgemen had mostly finished with these bodies Gather up the things Kaladin said Ive found us another place to scavenge We need to gather as much as we can then stash some in a chasm where it has a good chance of not being washed away The bridgemen picked up their findings slinging sacks over their shoulders and each man hefting a spear or two Within moments they headed down the dank chasm bottom following Syl They passed clefts in the ancient rock walls where old stormwashed bones had gotten lodged creating a mound of mosscovered femurs tibia skulls and ribs There wasnt much salvage among them After about a quarterhour they came to the place Syl had found A scattered group of Parshendi dead lay in heaps mixed with the occasional Alethi in blue Kaladin knelt beside one of the human bodies He recognized Dalinar Kholins stylized glyphpair sewn on the coat Why had Dalinars army joined Sadeass in battle What had changed Kaladin pointed for the men to begin scavenging from the Alethi while he walked over to one of the Parshendi corpses It was much fresher than Dalinars man They didnt find nearly as many Parshendi corpses as they did Alethi Not only were there fewer of them in any given battle but they were less likely to fall to their deaths into the chasms Sigzil also guessed that their bodies were more dense than human ones and didnt float or wash away as easily Kaladin rolled the body onto its side and the action elicited a sudden hiss from the back of the group of bridgemen Kaladin turned to see Shen pushing forward in an uncharacteristic display of passion Teft moved quickly grabbing Shen from behind placing him in a choke hold The other bridgemen stood aghast though several fell into their stances by reflex Shen struggled weakly against Tefts grip The parshman looked different from his dead cousins close together the differences were much more obvious Shenlike most parshmenwas short and a little plump Stout strong but not threatening The corpse at Kaladins feet however was muscled and built like a Horneater easily as tall as Kaladin and far broader at the shoulders While both had the marbled skin the Parshendi had those strange deepred growths of armor on the head chest arms and legs Let him go Kaladin said curious Teft glanced at him then reluctantly did as commanded Shen scrambled over the uneven ground and gently but firmly pushed Kaladin away from the corpse Shen stood back as if protecting it from Kaladin This thing Rock noted stepping up beside Kaladin he has done it before When Lopen and I take him scavenging Hes protective of the Parshendi bodies gancho Lopen added Like hed stab you a hundred times for moving one sure Theyre all like that Sigzil said from behind Kaladin turned raising an eyebrow Parshman workers Sigzil explained Theyre allowed to care for their own dead its one of the few things they seem passionate about They grow irate if anyone else handles the bodies They wrap them in linen and carry them out into the wilderness and leave them on slabs of stone Kaladin regarded Shen I wonder Scavenge from the Parshendi Kaladin said to his men Teft youll probably have to hold Shen the whole time I cant have him trying to stop us Teft shot Kaladin a suffering glance he still thought they should set Shen at the front of the bridge and let him die But he did as told pushing Shen away and getting Moashs help to hold him And men Kaladin noted be respectful of the dead Theyre Parshendi Leyten objected I know Kaladin said But it bothers Shen Hes one of us so lets keep his irritation to a minimum The parshman lowered his arms reluctantly and let Teft and Moash pull him away He seemed resigned Parshmen were slow of thought How much did Shen comprehend Didnt you wish to find a bow Sigzil asked kneeling and slipping a horned Parshendi shortbow out from underneath a body The bowstring is gone Theres another in this fellows pouch Maps said pulling something out of another Parshendi corpses belt pouch Might still be good Kaladin accepted the weapon and string Does anyone know how to use one of these The bridgemen glanced at one another Bows were useless for hunting most shellbeasts slings worked far better The bow was really only good for killing other men Kaladin glanced at Teft who shook his head He hadnt been trained on a bow neither had Kaladin Is simple Rock said rolling over a Parshendi corpse put arrow on string Point away from self Pull very hard Let go I doubt it will be that easy Kaladin said We barely have time to train the lads in the spear Kaladin Teft said You mean to teach some of them the bow as well And without a teacher who can use one himself Kaladin didnt respond He tucked the bow and string away in his bag added a few arrows then helped the others An hour later they marched through the chasms toward the ladder their torches sputtering dusk approaching The darker it grew the more unpleasant the chasms became Shadows deepened and distant soundswater dripping rocks falling wind callingtook on an ominous cast Kaladin rounded a corner and a group of manylegged cremlings scuttling along the wall and slipped into a fissure Conversation was subdued and Kaladin didnt take part Occasionally he glanced over his shoulder toward Shen The silent parshman walked head down Robbing the Parshendi corpses had seriously disturbed him I can use that Kaladin thought But dare I It would be a risk A great one He had already been sentenced once for upsetting the balance of the chasm battles First the spheres he thought Getting the spheres out would mean he might be able to get out other items Eventually he saw a shadow above spanning the chasm They had reached the first of the permanent bridges Kaladin walked with the others a little further until they reached a place where the chasm floor was closer to the top of the plateaus above He stopped here The bridgemen gathered around him Sigzil Kaladin said pointing You know something about bows How hard do you think it would be to hit that bridge with an arrow Ive occasionally held a bow Kaladin but I would not call myself an expert It shouldnt be too hard Id imagine The distance is what fifty feet Whats the point Moash asked Kaladin pulled out the pouch full of spheres then raised an eyebrow at them We tie the bag to the arrow then launch it up so that it sticks to the bottom of the bridge Then when were on a bridge run Lopen and Dabbid can hang back to get a drink near that bridge up there They reach under the wood and pull the arrow off We get the spheres Teft whistled Clever We could get all of the spheres Moash said eagerly Even the No Kaladin said firmly The lesser ones will be dangerous enough people might begin wondering where bridgemen are getting so much money He would have to buy his supplies from several different apothecaries to hide his influx of money Moash looked crestfallen but the other bridgemen were eager Who wants to try Kaladin asked Maybe we should shoot a few practice shots first then try with the bag Sigzil I dont know if I want this on me Sigzil said Maybe you should try Teft Teft rubbed his chin Sure I guess How hard can it be How hard Rock asked suddenly Kaladin glanced to the side Rock stood at the back of the group though his height made him easy to see He had his arms folded How hard Teft Rock continued Fifty feet is not too far but is not easy shot And to do it with bag of heavy spheres tied to it Ha You also need to get arrow close to side of bridge so Lopen can reach If you miss with this thing you could lose all spheres And what if scouts near bridges above see arrow come from chasm Will think it suspicious eh Kaladin eyed the Horneater Is simple hed said Point away from selflet go Well Kaladin said watching Rock from the corner of his eye I guess well just have to take that chance Without these spheres the wounded die We could wait until the next bridge run Teft said Tie a rope to the bridge and toss it over then tie the bag to it next time Fifty feet of rope Kaladin said flatly It would draw enough attention to buy something like that Nah gancho Lopen said I have a cousin who works in a place that sells rope I could get some for you easy with money Perhaps Kaladin said But youd still have to hide it in the litter then hang it down into the chasm without anyone seeing And to leave it dangling there for several days It would be noticed The others nodded Rock seemed very uncomfortable Sighing Kaladin took out the bow and several arrows Well just have to chance this Teft why dont you Oh Kalikalins ghost Rock muttered Here give me bow He shoved his way through the bridgemen taking the bow from Kaladin Kaladin hid a smile Rock glanced upward judging the distance in the waning light He strung the bowstring then held out a hand Kaladin handed him an arrow He leveled the bow back down the chasm and launched The arrow flew swiftly clattering against chasm walls Rock nodded to himself then pointed at Kaladins pouch We take only five spheres Rock said Any more would be too heavy Is crazy to try with even five Airsick lowlanders Kaladin smiled then counted out five sapphire markstogether about two and a half months worth of pay for a bridgemanand placed them in a spare pouch He handed that to Rock who pulled out a knife and dug a notch into an arrows wood next to the arrowhead Skar folded his arms and leaned against the mossy wall This is stealing you know Yes Kaladin said watching Rock And I dont feel the least bit bad about it Do you Not at all Skar said grinning I figure once someone is trying to get you killed all expectations of your loyalty are tossed to the storm But if someone were to go to Gaz The other bridgemen suddenly grew nervous and more than a few eyes darted toward Shen though Kaladin could see that Skar wasnt thinking of the Parshman If one of the bridgemen were to betray the rest of them he might earn himself a reward Maybe we should post a watch Drehy said You know make sure nobody sneaks off to talk to Gaz Well do no such thing Kaladin said What are we going to do Lock ourselves in the barrack so suspicious of each other that we never get anything done He shook his head No This is just one more danger Its a real one but we cant waste energy spying on each other So we keep on going Skar didnt look convinced Were Bridge Four Kaladin said firmly Weve faced death together We have to trust each other You cant run into battle wondering if your companions are going to switch sides suddenly He met the eyes of each man in turn I trust you All of you Well make it through this and well do it together There were several nods Skar seemed placated Rock finished his work cutting the arrow then proceeded to tie the pouch tightly around the shaft Syl still sat on Kaladins shoulder You want me to watch the others Make sure nobody does what Skar thinks they might Kaladin hesitated then nodded Best to be safe He just didnt want the men to have to think that way Rock hefted the arrow judging the weight Near impossible shot he complained Then in a smooth motion he nocked the arrow and drew to his cheek positioning himself directly beneath the bridge The small pouch hung down dangling against the wood of the arrow The bridgemen held their breath Rock loosed The arrow streaked up the side of the chasm wall almost too fast to follow A faint click sounded as arrow met wood and Kaladin held his breath but the arrow did not pull free It remained hanging there precious spheres tied to its shaft right next to the side of the bridge where it could be reached Kaladin clapped Rock on the shoulder as the bridgemen cheered him Rock eyed Kaladin I will not use bow to fight You must know this thing I promise Kaladin said Ill take you if you agree but I wont force you I will not fight Rock said Is not my place He glanced up at the spheres then smiled faintly But shooting bridge is all right How did you learn Kaladin asked Is secret Rock said firmly Take bow Bother me no more All right Kaladin said accepting the bow But I dont know if I can promise not to bother you I may need a few more shots in the future He eyed Lopen You really think you can buy some rope without drawing attention Lopen lounged back against the wall My cousins never failed me How many cousins do you have anyway Earless Jaks asked A man can never have enough cousins Lopen said Well we need that rope Kaladin said the plan beginning to sprout in his mind Do it Lopen Ill make change from those spheres above to pay for it Light grows so distant The storm never stops I am broken and all around me have died I weep for the end of all things He has won Oh he has beaten us Dated Palahakev 1173 16 seconds predeath Subject a Thaylen sailor Dalinar fought the Thrill pulsing within him swinging his Shardblade from atop Gallants back Around him Parshendi fell with eyes burning black They came at him in pairs each team trying to hit him from a different direction keeping him busy andthey hopeddisoriented If a pair could rush at him while he was distracted they might be able to shove him off his mount Those axes and macesswung repeatedlycould crack his Plate It was a very costly tactic corpses lay scattered around Dalinar But when fighting against a Shardbearer every tactic was costly Dalinar kept Gallant moving dancing from side to side swinging his Blade in broad sweeps He stayed just a little ahead of the line of his men A Shardbearer needed space to fight the Blades were so long that hurting ones companions was a very real danger His honor guard would approach only if he fell or encountered trouble The Thrill excited him strengthened him He hadnt experienced the weakness again the nausea he had on the battlefield that day weeks ago Perhaps hed been worried about nothing He turned Gallant just in time to confront two pairs of Parshendi coming at him from behind singing softly He directed Gallant with his knees performing an expert sweeping sideswing cutting through the necks of two Parshendi then the arm of a third Eyes burned out in the first two and they collapsed The third dropped his weapon from a hand that grew suddenly lifeless flopping down its nerves all severed The fourth member of that squad scrambled away glaring at Dalinar This was one of the Parshendi who didnt wear a beard and it seemed that there was something odd about his face The cheek structure was just a little off Was that a woman Dalinar thought with amazement It couldnt have been Could it Behind him his soldiers let out cheers as a large number of Parshendi scattered away to regroup Dalinar lowered his Shardblade the metal gleaming gloryspren winking into the air around him There was another reason for him to stay out ahead of his men A Shardbearer wasnt just a force of destruction he was a force of morale and inspiration The men fought more vigorously as they saw their brightlord felling foe after foe Shardbearers changed battles Since the Parshendi were broken for the moment Dalinar climbed free of Gallant and dropped to the rocks Corpses lay unbloodied all around him though once he approached the place where his men had been fighting orangered blood stained the rocks Cremlings scuttled about on the ground lapping up the liquid and painspren wriggled between them Wounded Parshendi lay staring up into the air faces masks of pain singing a quiet haunting song to themselves Often just as whispers They never yelled as they died Dalinar felt the Thrill retreat as he joined his honor guard Theyre getting too close to Gallant Dalinar said to Teleb handing over the reins The massive Ryshadiums coat was flecked with frothy sweat I dont want to risk him Have a man run him to the back lines Teleb nodded waving a soldier to obey the order Dalinar hefted his Shardblade scanning the battlefield The Parshendi force was regrouping As always the twoperson teams were the focus of their strategy Each pair would have different weapons and often one was cleanshaven while the other had a beard woven with gemstones His scholars had suggested this was some kind of primitive apprenticeship Dalinar inspected the cleanshaven ones for signs of any stubble There was none and more than a few had a faintly feminine shape to their faces Could the ones without beards all be women They didnt appear to have much in the way of breasts and their builds were like those of men but the strange Parshendi armor could be masking things The beardless ones did seem smaller by a few fingers and the shapes of the facesstudying them it seemed possible Could the pairs be husbands and wives fighting together That struck him as strangely fascinating Was it possible that despite six years of war nobody had taken the time to investigate the genders of those they fought Yes The contested plateaus were so far out nobody ever brought back Parshendi bodies they just set men to pulling the gemstones out of their beards or gathering their weapons Since Gavilars death very little effort had been given to studying the Parshendi Everyone just wanted them dead and if there was one thing the Alethi were good at it was killing And youre supposed to be killing them now Dalinar told himself not analyzing their culture But he did decide to have his soldiers collect a few bodies for the scholars He charged toward another section of the battlefield Shardblade before him in two hands making certain not to outpace his soldiers To the south he could see Adolins banner flying as he led his division against the Parshendi there The lad had been uncharacteristically reserved lately Being wrong about Sadeas seemed to have made him more contemplative On the west side Sadeass own banner flew proudly Sadeass forces keeping the Parshendi from the chrysalis Hed arrived first as before engaging the Parshendi so Dalinars companies could arrive Dalinar had considered cutting out the gemheart so the Alethi could retreat but why end the battle that quickly He and Sadeas both felt the real point of their alliance was to crush as many Parshendi as possible The more they killed the faster this war would be through And so far Dalinars plan was working The two armies complemented one another Dalinars assaults had been too slow and hed allowed the Parshendi to position themselves too well Sadeas was fastmore so now that he could leave men behind and concentrate fully on speedand he was frighteningly effective at getting men onto the plateaus to fight but his men werent trained as well as Dalinars So if Sadeas could arrive first then hold out long enough for Dalinar to get his men across the superior trainingand superior Shardsof his forces worked like a hammer against the Parshendi smashing them against Sadeass anvil It was still by no means easy The Parshendi fought like chasmfiends Dalinar crashed against them swinging out with his blade slaying Parshendi on all sides He couldnt help but feel a grudging respect for the Parshendi Few men dared assault a Shardbearer directlyat least not without the entire weight of their army forcing them forward almost against their will These Parshendi attacked with bravery Dalinar spun laying about him the Thrill surging within With an ordinary sword a fighter focused on controlling his blows striking and expecting recoil You wanted quick rapid strikes with small arcs A Shardblade was different The Blade was enormous yet remarkably light There was never recoil landing a blow felt nearly like passing the blade through the air itself The trick was to control momentum and keep the blade moving Four Parshendi threw themselves at him they seemed to know that working into close quarters was one of the best ways to drop him If they got too close the length of his Blades hilt and the nature of his armor would make fighting more difficult for him Dalinar spun in a long waisthigh attack and noted the deaths of Parshendi by the slight tug on the Blade as it passed through their chests He got all four of them and felt a surge of satisfaction It was followed immediately by nausea Damnation he thought Not again He turned toward another group of Parshendi as the eyes of the dead burned out and smoked He threw himself into another attackraising Blade in a twisting swing over his head then bringing it down parallel to the ground Six Parshendi died He felt a spike of regret along with displeasure at the Thrill Surely these Parshendithese soldiersdeserved respect not glee as they were slaughtered He remembered the times when the Thrill had been the strongest Subduing the highprinces with Gavilar during their youths forcing back the Vedens fighting the Herdazians and destroying the Akak Reshi Once the thirst for battle had nearly led him to attack Gavilar himself Dalinar could remember the jealousy on that day some ten years ago when the itch to attack Gavilarthe only worthy opponent he could see the man who had won Navanis handhad nearly consumed him His honor guard cheered as his foes dropped He felt hollow but he seized the Thrill and got a tight grip on his feelings and emotions He let the Thrill pulse through him Blessedly the sickness went away which was good for another group of Parshendi charged him from the side He executed a Windstance turn shifting his feet lowering his shoulder and throwing his weight behind his Blade as he swung He got three in the sweep but the fourth and final Parshendi shoved past his wounded comrades getting inside Dalinars reach swinging his hammer His eyes were wide with anger and determination though he did not yell or bellow He just continued his song His blow cracked into Dalinars helm It pushed his head to the side but the Plate absorbed most of the hit a few tiny weblike lines cracking along its length Dalinar could see them glowing faintly releasing Stormlight at the edges of his vision The Parshendi was in too close Dalinar dropped his Blade The weapon puffed away to mist as Dalinar raised an armored arm and blocked the next hammer blow Then he swung with his other arm smashing his fist into the Parshendis shoulder The blow tossed the man to the ground The Parshendis song cut off Gritting his teeth Dalinar stepped up and kicked the man in the chest throwing the body a good twenty feet through the air Hed learned to be wary of Parshendi who werent fully incapacitated Dalinar lowered his hands and began to resummon his Shardblade He felt strong again passion for battle returning to him I shouldnt feel bad for killing the Parshendi he thought This is right He paused noticing something What was that on the next plateau over It looked like Like a second Parshendi army Several groups of his scouts were dashing toward the main battle lines but Dalinar could guess the news they brought Stormfather he cursed pointing with his Shardblade Pass the warning A second army approaches Several men scattered in accordance to his command We should have expected this Dalinar thought We started bringing two armies to a plateau so they have done the same But that implied that they had limited themselves before Did they do it because they realized that the battlefields left little room for maneuvering Or was it for speed But that didnt make sensethe Alethi had to worry about bridges as choke points slowing them more and more if they brought more troops But the Parshendi could jump the chasms So why commit fewer troops than their all Curse it all he thought with frustration We know so little about them He shoved his Shardblade into the rock beside him placing it intentionally so that it didnt vanish He began calling out orders His honor guard formed around him ushering in scouts and sending out runners For a short time he became a tactical general rather than an advance warrior It took time to change their battlefield strategy An army was like a massive chull at times lumbering along slow to react Before his orders could be executed the new Parshendi force began crossing over onto the north side That was where Sadeas was fighting Dalinar couldnt get a good view and scout reports were taking too long He glanced to the side there was a tall rock formation nearby It had uneven sides making it look a little like a pile of boards stacked one atop another He grabbed his Shardblade in the middle of a report and ran across the stony ground smashing a few Rockbuds beneath his plated boots The Cobalt Guard and the messengers followed quickly At the rock formation Dalinar tossed his Blade aside letting it dissolve to smoke He threw himself up and grabbed the rock scaling the formation Seconds later he heaved himself up onto its flat top The battlefield stretched out below him The main Parshendi army was a mass of red and black at the center of the plateau now pressed on two sides by the Alethi Sadeas bridge crews waited on a western plateau ignored while the new force of Parshendi crossed from the north onto the battlefield Stormfather but they can jump Dalinar thought watching the Parshendi span the gap in powerful leaps Six years of fighting had shown Dalinar that human soldiersparticularly if lightly armoredcould outrun Parshendi troops if they had to go more than a few dozen yards But those thick powerful Parshendi legs could send them far when they leaped Not a single Parshendi lost his footing as they crossed the chasm They approached the chasm at a trot then dashed with a burst of speed for about ten feet launching themselves forward The new force pushed south directly into Sadeass army Raising a hand against the bright white sunlight Dalinar found he could make out Sadeass personal banner It was directly in the path of the oncoming Parshendi force he tended to remain at the back of his armies in a secure position Now that position suddenly became the front lines and Sadeass other troops were too slow to disengage and react He didnt have any support Sadeas Dalinar thought stepping right up to the lip of the stone his cape streaming behind him in the breeze I need to send him my reserve spearmen But no theyd be too slow The spearmen couldnt get to him But someone mounted might be able to Gallant Dalinar bellowed throwing himself off the rock formation He fell to the rocks below Plate absorbing the shock as he hit cracking the stone Stormlight puffed up around him rising from his armor and the greaves cracked slightly Gallant pulled away from his minders galloping across the stones at Dalinars call As the horse approached Dalinar grabbed the saddleholds and heaved himself up and into place Follow if you can he bellowed at his honor guard and send a runner to tell my son he now commands our army Dalinar reared Gallant and galloped alongside the perimeter of the battlefield His guard called for their horses but theyd have difficulty keeping up with a Ryshadium So be it Fighting soldiers became a blur to Dalinars right He leaned low in the saddle wind hissing as it blew over his Shardplate He held a hand out and summoned Oathbringer It dropped into his hand steaming and frosted as he turned Gallant around the western tip of the battlefield By design the original Parshendi army lay between his force and Sadeass He didnt have time to round them So taking a deep breath Dalinar struck out through the middle of it Their ranks were spread out because of how they fought Gallant galloped through them and Parshendi threw themselves out of the massive stallions way cursing in their melodic language Hooves beat a thunder upon the rocks Dalinar urged Gallant on with his knees They had to keep momentum Some Parshendi fighting on the front against Sadeass force turned and ran at him They saw the opportunity If Dalinar fell hed land alone surrounded by thousands of enemies Dalinars heart thumped as he held his Blade out trying to swipe at Parshendi who came too close Within minutes he approached the northwestern Parshendi line There his enemies formed up raising spears and setting them against the ground Blast Dalinar thought Parshendi had never set spears like that against heavy cavalry before They were starting to learn Dalinar charged the formation then wheeled Gallant at the last moment turning parallel to the Parshendi spear wall He swung his Shardblade out to the side shearing the tips from their weapons and hitting a few arms A patch of Parshendi just ahead wavered and Dalinar took a deep breath urging Gallant directly into them shearing off a few spear tips Another one bounced off his shoulder armor and Gallant took a long gash on the left flank Their momentum carried them forward trampling over the Parshendi and with a whinny Gallant burst free of the Parshendi line just to the side of where Sadeass main force was engaging the enemy Dalinars heart pumped He passed Sadeass force in a blur galloping toward the back lines where a churning disorganized chaos of men tried to react to the new Parshendi force Men screamed and died a mess of forest green Alethi and Parshendi in black and red There Dalinar saw Sadeass banner flap for a moment before falling He threw himself from Gallants saddle and hit the stones The horse turned away understanding His wound was bad and Dalinar would not risk him any further It was time for the slaughter to begin again He tore into the Parshendi force from the side and some turned looks of surprise in their usually stoic black eyes At times the Parshendi seemed alien but their emotions were so human The Thrill rose and Dalinar did not force it down He needed it too much An ally was in danger It was time to let the Blackthorn loose Dalinar punched through the Parshendi ranks He felled Parshendi like a man sweeping crumbs from the table after a meal There was no controlled precision here no careful engagement of a few squads with his honor guard at the back This was a fullout attack with all the power and deadly force of a lifelong killer enhanced by Shards He was like a tempest slashing through legs torsos arms necks killing killing killing He was a maelstrom of death and steel Weapons bounced off his armor leaving tiny cracks He killed dozens always moving forcing his way toward where Sadeass banner had fallen Eyes burned swords flashed in the sky and Parshendi sang The close press of their own troopsbunching up as they hit Sadeass lineinhibited them But not Dalinar He didnt have to worry about striking friends nor did he have to worry about his weapon getting caught in flesh or stuck in armor And if corpses got in his way he sheared through themdead flesh would cut like steel and wood Soon Parshendi blood splashed in the air as he killed then hacked then shoved his way through the press Blade from shoulder to side back and forth occasionally turning to sweep at those trying to kill him from behind He stumbled on a swath of green cloth Sadeass banner Dalinar spun searching Behind him hed left a line of corpses that was quickly yet carefully being stepped past by more Parshendi focused on him Except just to his left None of the Parshendi there turned toward him Sadeas Dalinar thought leaping forward cutting down Parshendi from behind That revealed a group of them bunched in a circle beating on something below them Something leaking Stormlight Just to the side lay a large Shardbearers hammer fallen where Sadeas had apparently dropped it Dalinar leaped forward dropping his Blade and grabbing the hammer He roared as he slammed it into the group tossing a dozen Parshendi away from him then turned and swung again on the other side Bodies sprayed into the air hurled backward The hammer worked better in such close quarters the Blade would simply have killed the men dropping their corpses to the ground leaving him still pressed and pinned The hammer however flung the bodies away He leaped into the middle of the area hed just cleared positioning himself with one foot on either side of the fallen Sadeas He began the process of summoning his Blade again and laid about him with the hammer scattering his enemies At the ninth beat of his heart he threw the hammer into the face of a Parshendi then let Oathbringer reform in his hands He fell immediately into Windstance glancing downward Sadeass armor leaked Stormlight from a dozen different breaks and rifts The breastplate had been shattered completely broken jagged bits of metal jutted out revealing the uniform underneath Wisps of radiant smoke trailed from the holes There was no time to check if he still lived The Parshendi now saw not one but two Shardbearers within their grasp and they threw themselves at Dalinar Warrior after warrior fell as Dalinar slaughtered them in sweeps protecting the space just around him He couldnt stop them all His armor took hits mostly on the arms and back The armor cracked like a crystal under too much stress He roared striking down four Parshendi as two more hit him from behind making his armor vibrate He spun and killed one the other barely dancing out of range Dalinar began to pant and when he moved quickly he left trails of blue Stormlight in the air He felt like a bloodied prey beast trying to fend off a thousand different snapping predators at once But he was no chull whose only protection was to hide He killed and the Thrill rose to a crescendo within him He sensed real danger a chance of falling and that made the Thrill surge He nearly choked on it the joy the pleasure the desire The danger More and more blows got through more and more Parshendi were able to duck or dodge out of the way of his Blade He felt a breeze through the back of his breastplate Cooling terrible frightening The cracks were widening If the breastplate burst He screamed slamming his blade down through a Parshendi burning out his eyes dropping the man without a mark on his skin Dalinar brought his Blade up spinning cutting through the legs of another foe His insides were a tempest of emotions and his brow beneath the helm streamed with sweat What would happen to the Alethi army if both he and Sadeas fell here Two highprinces dead in the same battle two sets of Plate and one Blade lost It couldnt happen He wouldnt fall here He didnt yet know if he was mad or not He couldnt die until he knew Suddenly a wave of Parshendi died that he hadnt attacked A figure in brilliant blue Shardplate burst through them Adolin held his massive Shardblade in a single hand the metal gleaming Adolin swung again and the Cobalt Guard rushed forward pouring into the gap Adolin created The Parshendi song changed tempo becoming frantic and they fell back as more and more troops punched through some in green others in blue Dalinar knelt down exhausted letting his Blade vanish His guard surrounded him and Adolins army washed over them all overrunning the Parshendi forcing them back In a few minutes the area was secure The danger was past Father Adolin said kneeling beside him pulling his helm off The youths blond and black hair was disheveled and sweatslick Storms You gave me a fright Are you well Dalinar pulled his own helm free sweet cooling air washing across his damp face He took a deep breath then nodded Your timing isquite good son Adolin helped Dalinar back to his feet I had to punch through the entire Parshendi army No disrespect Father but what in the storms made you pull a stunt like that The knowledge that you could handle the army if I fell Dalinar said clapping his son on the arm their Plate clinking Adolin caught sight of the back of Dalinars Shardplate and his eyes opened wide Bad Dalinar asked Looks like its held together with spit and twine Adolin said Youre leaking Light like a wineskin used for archery practice Dalinar nodded sighing Already his Plate was feeling sluggish Hed probably have to remove it before they returned to the camp lest it freeze on him To the side several soldiers were pulling Sadeas free of his Plate It was so far gone that the Light had stopped save for a few tiny wisps It could be fixed but it would be expensiveregenerating Shardplate generally shattered the gemstones it drew Light from The soldiers pulled Sadeass helm off and Dalinar was relieved to see his former friend blinking looking disoriented but largely uninjured He had a cut on his thigh where one of the Parshendi had gotten him with a sword and a few scrapes on his chest Sadeas looked up at Dalinar and Adolin Dalinar stiffened expecting recriminationthis had only happened because Dalinar had insisted on fighting with two armies on the same plateau That had goaded the Parshendi into bringing another army Dalinar should have set proper scouts to watch for that Sadeas however smiled a wide grin Stormfather but that was close How goes the battle The Parshendi are routed Adolin said The last force resisting was the one around you Our men are cutting the gemheart free at this moment The day is ours We win again Sadeas said triumphantly Dalinar once in a while it appears that senile old brain of yours can come up with a good idea or two Were the same age Sadeas Dalinar noted as messengers approached bearing reports from the rest of the battlefield Spread the word Sadeas proclaimed Tonight all my soldiers will feast as if they were lighteyes He smiled as his soldiers helped him to his feet and Adolin moved over to take the scout reports Sadeas waved away the help insisting he could stand despite his wound and began calling for his officers Dalinar turned to seek out Gallant and make sure the horses wound was cared for As he did however Sadeas caught his arm I should be dead Sadeas said softly Perhaps I didnt see much But I thought I saw you alone Where was your honor guard I had to leave it behind Dalinar said It was the only way to get to you in time Sadeas frowned That was a terrible risk Dalinar Why You do not abandon your allies on the battlefield Not unless theres no recourse It is one of the Codes Sadeas shook his head That honor of yours is going to get you killed Dalinar He seemed bemused Not that I feel like offering a complaint about it this day If I should die Dalinar said then I would do so having lived my life right It is not the destination that matters but how one arrives there The Codes No The Way of Kings That storming book That storming book saved your life today Sadeas Dalinar said I think Im starting to understand what Gavilar saw in it Sadeas scowled at that though he glanced at his armor lying in pieces nearby He shook his head Perhaps I shall let you tell me what you mean Id like to understand you again old friend Im beginning to wonder if I ever really did He let go of Dalinars arm Someone bring me my storming horse Where are my officers Dalinar left and quickly found several members of his guard seeing to Gallant As he joined them he was struck by the sheer number of corpses on the ground They ran in a line where he had punched through the Parshendi ranks to get to Sadeas a trail of death He looked back to where hed made his stand Dozens dead Perhaps hundreds Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought Did I do that He hadnt killed in such numbers since the early days of helping Gavilar unite Alethkar And he hadnt grown sick at the sight of death since his youth Yet now he found himself revolted barely able to keep his stomach under control He would not retch on the battlefield His men should not see that He stumbled away one hand to his head the other carrying his helm He should be exulting But he couldnt He justcouldnt You will need luck trying to understand me Sadeas he thought Because Im having Damnations own trouble trying to do so myself I hold the suckling child in my hands a knife at his throat and know that all who live wish me to let the blade slip Spill its blood upon the ground over my hands and with it gain us further breath to draw Dated Shashanan 1173 23 seconds predeath Subject a darkeyed youth of sixteen years Sample is of particular note And all the world was shattered Maps yelled back arching eyes wide flecks of red spittle on his cheeks The rocks trembled with their steps and the stones reached toward the heavens We die We die He spasmed one last time and the light faded from his eyes Kaladin sat back crimson blood slick on his hands the dagger hed been using as a surgical knife slipping from his fingers and clicking softly against the stone The affable man lay dead on the stones of a plateau arrow wound in his left breast open to the air splitting the birthmark hed claimed looked like Alethkar Its taking them Kaladin thought One by one Open them up bleed them out Were nothing more than pouches to carry blood Then we die rain it down on the stones like a highstorms floods Until only I remain I always remain A layer of skin a layer of fat a layer of muscle a layer of bone That was what men were The battle raged across the chasm It might as well have been another kingdom for all the attention anyone gave the bridgemen Die die die then get out of our way The members of Bridge Four stood in a solemn ring around Kaladin What was that he said at the end Skar asked The rocks trembled It was nothing said thickarmed Yake Just dying delirium It happens to men sometimes More often lately it seems Teft said He held his hand to his arm where hed hastily wrapped a bandage around an arrow wound He wouldnt be carrying a bridge anytime soon Mapss death and Ariks death left them with only twentysix members now It was barely enough to carry a bridge The greater heaviness was very noticeable and they had difficulty keeping up with the other bridge crews A few more losses and theyd be in serious trouble I should have been faster Kaladin thought looking down at Maps splayed open his insides exposed for the sun to dry The arrowhead had pierced his lung and lodged in his spine Could Lirin have saved him If Kaladin had studied in Kharbranth as his father had wished would he have learned enoughknown enoughto prevent deaths like this This happens sometimes son Kaladin raised shaking bloody hands to his face gripping his head as memory consumed him A young girl a cracked head a broken leg an angry father Despair hate loss frustration horror How could any man live this way To be a surgeon to live knowing that you would be too weak to save some When other men failed a field of crops got worms in them When a surgeon failed someone died You have to learn when to care As if he could choose Banish it like snuffing a lantern Kaladin bowed beneath the weight I should have saved him I should have saved him I should have saved him Maps Dunny Amark Goshel Dallet Nalma Tien Kaladin Syls voice Be strong If I were strong he hissed they would live The other bridgemen still need you You promised them Kaladin You gave your oath Kaladin looked up The bridgemen seemed anxious and worried There were only eight of them Kaladin had sent the others to look for fallen bridgemen from other crews Theyd found three initially minor wounds that Skar could care for No runners had come for him Either the bridge crews had no other wounded or those wounded were beyond help Maybe he should have gone to look just in case Butnumbhe could not face yet another dying man he could not save He stumbled to his feet and walked away from the corpse He stepped up to the chasm and forced himself to fall into the old stance Tukks had taught him Feet apart hands behind his back clasping forearms Straightbacked staring forward The familiarity brought him strength You were wrong Father he thought You said Id learn to deal with the deaths And yet here I am Years later Same problem The bridgemen fell in around him Lopen approached with a waterskin Kaladin hesitated then accepted the skin washing off his face and hands The warm water splashed across his skin then brought welcome coolness as it evaporated He let out a deep breath nodding thanks to the short Herdazian man Lopen raised an eyebrow then gestured to the pouch tied to his waist He had recovered the newest pouch of spheres theyd stuck to the bridge with an arrow This was the fourth time theyd done that and had recovered them each without incident Did you have any trouble Kaladin asked No gancho Lopen said smiling widely Easy as tripping a Horneater I heard that Rock said gruffly standing in parade rest a short distance away And the rope Kaladin asked I dropped the whole coil right over the side Lopen said But I didnt tie the end to anything Just like you said Good Kaladin said A rope dangling from a bridge would have just been too obvious If Hashal or Gaz caught scent of what Kaladin was planning And where is Gaz Kaladin thought Why didnt he come on the bridge run Lopen gave Kaladin the pouch of spheres as if eager to be rid of the responsibility Kaladin accepted it stuffing it into his trouser pocket Lopen retreated and Kaladin fell back into parade rest The plateau on the other side of the chasm was long and thin with steep slopes on the sides Just as in the last few battles Dalinar Kholin helped Sadeass force He always arrived late Perhaps he blamed his slow chullpulled bridges Very convenient His men often had the luxury of crossing without archery fire Sadeas and Dalinar won more battles this way Not that it mattered to the bridgemen Many people were dying on the other side of the chasm but Kaladin didnt feel a thing for them No itch to heal them no desire to help Kaladin could thank Hav for that for training him to think in terms of us and them In a way Kaladin had learned what his father had talked about In the wrong way but it was something Protect the us destroy the them A soldier had to think like that So Kaladin hated the Parshendi They were the enemy If he hadnt learned to divide his mind like that war would have destroyed him Perhaps it had done so anyway As he watched the battle he focused on one thing in particular to distract himself How did the Parshendi treat their dead Their actions seemed irregular The Parshendi soldiers rarely disturbed their dead after they fell theyd take roundabout paths of attack to avoid dead bodies And when the Alethi marched over the Parshendi dead they formed points of terrible conflict Did the Alethi notice Probably not But he could see that the Parshendi revered their deadrevered them to the extent that they would endanger the living to preserve the corpses of the fallen Kaladin could use that He would use that Somehow The Alethi eventually won the battle Before long Kaladin and his team were slogging back across the plateau carrying their bridge three wounded lashed to the top They had found only those three and a part of Kaladin felt sick inside as he realized another part of him was glad He had already rescued some fifteen men from other bridge crews and it was straining their resourceseven with the money from the pouchesto feed them Their barrack was crowded with the wounded Bridge Four reached a chasm and Kaladin moved to lower his burden The process was rote to him now Lower the bridge quickly untie the wounded push the bridge across the chasm Kaladin checked on the three wounded Every man he rescued this way seemed bemused at what hed done even though hed been doing it for weeks now Satisfied that they were all right he moved to stand at parade rest while the soldiers crossed Bridge Four fell in around him Increasingly they earned scowls from the soldiersboth darkeyed and lighteyedwho crossed Why do they do that Moash said quietly as a passing soldier tossed an overripe pilevine fruit at the bridgemen Moash wiped the stringy red fruit from his face then sighed and fell back into his stance Kaladin had never asked them to join him but they did it each time When I fought in Amarams army Kaladin said I dreamed about joining the troops at the Shattered Plains Everyone knew that the soldiers left in Alethkar were the dregs We imagined the real soldiers off fighting in the glorious war to bring retribution to those who had killed our king Those soldiers would treat their fellows with fairness Their discipline would be firm Each would be an expert with the spear and he would not break rank on the battlefield To the side Teft snorted quietly Kaladin turned to Moash Why do they treat us so Moash Because they know they should be better than they are Because they see discipline in bridgemen and it embarrasses them Rather than bettering themselves they take the easier road of jeering at us Dalinar Kholins soldiers dont act like that Skar said from just behind Kaladin His men march in straight ranks There is order in their camp If theyre on duty they dont leave their coats unbuttoned or lounge about Will I never stop hearing about Dalinar storming Kholin Kaladin thought Men had spoken that way of Amaram How easy it was to ignore a blackened heart if you dressed it in a pressed uniform and a reputation for honesty Several hours later the sweaty and exhausted group of bridgemen tramped up the incline to the lumberyard They dumped their bridge in its resting place It was getting late Kaladin would have to purchase food immediately if they were going to have supplies for the evening stew He wiped his hands on his towel as the members of Bridge Four lined up Youre dismissed for evening activities he said We have chasm duty early tomorrow Morning bridge practice will have to be moved to late afternoon The bridgemen nodded then Moash raised a hand As one the bridgemen raised their arms and crossed them wrists together hands in fists It had the look of a practiced effort After that they trotted away Kaladin raised an eyebrow tucking his towel into his belt Teft hung back smiling What was that Kaladin asked The men wanted a salute Teft said We cant use a regular military salutenot with the spearmen already thinking were too bigheaded So I taught them my old squad salute When This morning While you were getting our schedule from Hashal Kaladin smiled Odd how he could still do that Nearby the other nineteen bridge crews on todays run dropped off their bridges one by one Had Bridge Four once looked like them with those ragged beards and haunted expressions None of them spoke to one another Some few glanced at Kaladin as they passed but they looked down as soon as they saw he was watching Theyd stopped treating Bridge Four with the contempt theyd once shown Curiously they now seemed to regard Kaladins crew as they did everyone else in campas people above them They hastened to avoid his notice Poor sodden fools Kaladin thought Could he maybe persuade Hashal to let him take a few into Bridge Four He could the use extra men and seeing those slumped figures twisted his heart I know that look lad Teft said Why is it you always have to help everyone Bah Kaladin said I cant even protect Bridge Four Here let me look at that arm of yours Its not that bad Kaladin grabbed his arm anyway peeling away the bloodcrusted bandage The cut was long but shallow We need antiseptic on this Kaladin said noting a few red rotspren crawling around on the wound I should probably sew it up Its not that bad Still Kaladin said waving for Teft to follow as he approached one of the rain barrels alongside the lumberyard The wound was shallow enough that Teft would probably be able to show the others spear thrusts and blocks tomorrow during chasm duty but that was no excuse for leaving it alone to fester or scar At the rain barrel Kaladin washed out the wound then called for Lopenwho was standing in the shade beside the barrackto bring his medical equipment The Herdazian man gave that salute again though he did it with one arm and sauntered away to get the pack So lad Teft said How do you feel Any odd experiences lately Kaladin frowned looking up from the arm Storm it Teft Thats the fifth time in two days youve asked me that What are you getting at Nothing nothing It is something Kaladin said What is it youre digging for Teft I Gancho Lopen said walking up carrying the medical supply pack over his shoulder Here you go Kaladin glanced at him then reluctantly accepted the pack He pulled the drawstrings open Well want to A quick motion came from Teft Like a punch being thrown Kaladin moved by reflex taking in a sharp breath moving to a defensive stance arms up one hand a fist the other back to block Something blossomed within Kaladin Like a deep breath drawn in like a burning liquor injected directly into his blood A powerful wave pulsed through his body Energy strength awareness It was like the bodys natural alert response to danger only it was a hundredfold more intense Kaladin caught Tefts fist moving blurringly quick Teft froze What are you doing Kaladin demanded Teft was smiling He stepped back pulling his fist free Kelek he said shaking his hand Thats some grip youve got Why did you try to strike me I wanted to see something Teft said Youre holding that pouch of spheres Lopen gave you you see and your own pouch with what weve gathered lately More Stormlight than youve probably ever carried at least recently What does that have to do with anything Kaladin demanded What was that heat inside of him that burning in his veins Gancho Lopen said his voice awed Youre glowing Kaladin frowned What is he And then he noticed it It was very faint but it was there wisps of luminescent smoke curling up from his skin Like steam coming off a bowl of hot water on a cold winter night Shaking Kaladin put the medical pack on the broad rim of the water barrel He felt a moment of coldness on his skin What was that Shocked he raised his other hand looking at the wisps streaming off of it What did you do to me he demanded looking up at Teft The older bridgeman was still smiling Answer me Kaladin said stepping forward grabbing the front of Tefts shirt Stormfather but I feel strong I didnt do anything lad Teft said Youve been doing this for a while now I caught you feeding off Stormlight when you were sick Stormlight Kaladin hastily released Teft fishing at the pouch of spheres in his pocket He yanked it free and pulled it open It was dark inside All five gemstones had been drained The white light streaming from Kaladins skin faintly illuminated the inside of the bag Now thats something Lopen said from the side Kaladin spun to find the Herdazian man bending down and looking at the medical pack Why was that so important Then Kaladin saw it He thought hed set the pack on the rim of the barrel but in his haste hed just pressed it against the side of the barrel The pack now clung to the wood Stuck there hanging as if from an invisible hook Faintly streaming light just like Kaladin As Kaladin watched the light faded and the pack slumped free and fell to the ground Kaladin raised a hand to his forehead looking from the surprised Lopen to the curious Teft Then he glanced around the lumberyard frantic Nobody else was looking at them in the sunlight the vapors were too faint to see from a distance Stormfatherwhathow He caught sight of a familiar shape above Syl moved like a blown leaf tossed this way and that leisurely faint She did it Kaladin thought What has she done to me He stumbled away from Lopen and Teft running toward Syl His footsteps propelling him forward with too much speed Syl he bellowed stopping beneath her She zipped down to hover before him changing from a leaf to a young woman standing in the air Yes Kaladin glanced around Come with me he said hurrying to one of the alleys between barracks He pressed himself up against a wall standing in the shade breathing in and out Nobody could see him here Syl alighted in the air before him hands behind her back looking closely at him Youre glowing What have you done to me She cocked her head then shrugged Syl he said threateningly though he wasnt certain what harm he could do a spren I dont know Kaladin she said frankly sitting down her legs hanging over the side of the invisible platform I canI can only faintly remember things I used to know so well This world interacting with men But you did do something We have done something It wasnt me It wasnt you But together She shrugged again That isnt very helpful She grimaced I know Im sorry Kaladin raised a hand In the shade the light streaming off of him was more obvious If someone walked byHow do I get rid of it Why do you want to get rid of it Well becauseIBecause Syl didnt respond Something occurred to Kaladin Something perhaps he should have asked long ago Youre not a windspren are you She hesitated then shook her head No What are you then I dont know I bind things Bind things When she played pranks she made items stick together Shoes stuck to the ground and made men trip People reached for their jackets hanging on hooks and couldnt pull them free Kaladin reached down picking a stone up off the ground It was as big as his palm weathered smooth by highstorm winds and rain He pressed it against the wall of the barrack and willed his Light into the stone He felt a chill The rock began to stream with luminescent vapors When Kaladin pulled his hand away the stone remained where it was clinging to the side of the building Kaladin leaned close squinting He thought he could faintly make out tiny spren dark blue and shaped like little splashes of ink clustering around the place where the rock met the wall Bindspren Syl said walking up beside his head she was still standing in the air Theyre holding the rock in place Maybe Or maybe theyre attracted to what youve done in affixing the stone there Thats not how it works Is it Do rotspren cause sickness Syl said idly or are they attracted to it Everyone knows they cause it And do windspren cause the wind Rainspren cause the rain Flamespren cause fires He hesitated No they didnt Did they This is pointless I need to find out how to get rid of this light not study it And why Syl repeated must you get rid of it Kaladin youve heard the stories Men who walked on walls men who bound the storms to them Windrunners Why would you want to be rid of something like this Kaladin struggled to define it The healing the way he never got hit running at the front of the bridgeYes hed known something odd was happening Why did it frighten him so Was it because he feared being set apart like his father always was as the surgeon in Hearthstone Or was it something greater Im doing what the Radiants did he said Thats what I just said Ive been wondering if Im bad luck or if Ive run afoul of something like the Old Magic Maybe this explains it The Almighty cursed the Lost Radiants for betraying mankind What if Im cursed too because of what Im doing Kaladin she said you are not cursed You just said you dont know whats happening He paced in the alleyway To the side the rock finally plopped free and clattered to the ground Can you say with all certainty that what Im doing might not have drawn bad luck down upon me Do you know enough to deny it completely Syl She stood in the air her arms folded saying nothing Thisthing Kaladin said gesturing toward the stone It isnt natural The Radiants betrayed mankind Their powers left them and they were cursed Everyone knows the legends He looked down at his hands still glowing though more faintly than before Whatever weve done whatever has happened to me Ive somehow brought upon myself their same curse Thats why everyone around me dies when I try to help them And you think Im a curse she asked him IWell you said youre part of it and She strode forward pointing at him a tiny irate woman hanging in the air So you think Ive caused all of this Your failures The deaths Kaladin didnt respond He realized almost immediately that silence might be the worst response Sylsurprisingly human in her emotionsspun in the air with a wounded look and zipped away forming a ribbon of light Im overreacting he told himself He was just so unsettled He leaned back against the wall hand to head Before he had time to collect his thoughts shadows darkened the entry to the alleyway Teft and Lopen Rock talkers Lopen said You really shine in shade gancho Teft gripped Lopens shoulder Hes not going to tell anyone lad Ill make certain of it Yeah gancho Lopen said I swore Id say nothing You can trust a Herdazian Kaladin looked at the two overwhelmed He pushed past them running out of the alley and across the lumberyard fleeing from watching eyes By the time night drew close the light had long since stopped streaming from Kaladins body It had faded like a fire going out and had only taken a few minutes to vanish Kaladin walked southward along the edge of the Shattered Plains in that transitional area between the warcamps and the Plains themselves In some areaslike at the staging area near Sadeass lumbercampthere was a soft slope leading down between the two At other points there was a short ridge eight or so feet tall He passed one of these now rocks to his right open Plains to his left Hollows crevasses and nooks scored the rock Some shadowed sections here still hid pools of water from the highstorms days ago Creatures still scuttled around the rocks though the cooling evening air would soon drive them to hide He passed a place pocked with small waterfilled holes cremlingsmultilegged bearing tiny claws their elongated bodies plated with carapacelapped and fed at the edges A small tentacle snapped out yanking one down into the hole Probably a grasper Grass grew up the side of the ridge beside him and the blades peeked from their holes Bunches of fingermoss sprouted like flowers amid the green The bright pink and purple fingermoss tendrils were reminiscent of tentacles themselves waving at him in the wind When he passed the timid grass pulled back but the fingermoss was bolder The clumps would only pull into their shells if he tapped the rock near them Above him on the ridge a few scouts stood watch over the Shattered Plains This area beneath the ridge belonged to no specific highprince and the scouts ignored Kaladin He would only be stopped if he tried to leave the warcamps at the southern or northern sides None of the bridgemen had come after him He wasnt certain what Teft had told them Perhaps hed said Kaladin was distraught following Mapss death It felt odd to be alone Ever since hed been betrayed by Amaram and made a slave he had been in the company of others Slaves with whom hed plotted Bridgemen with whom hed worked Soldiers to guard him slavemasters to beat him friends to depend on him The last time hed been alone had been that night when hed been tied up for the highstorm to kill him No he thought I wasnt alone that night Syl was there He lowered his head passing small cracks in the ground to his left Those lines eventually grew into chasms as they moved eastward What was happening to him He wasnt delusional Teft and Lopen had seen it too Teft had actually seemed to expect it Kaladin should have died during that highstorm And yet he had been up and walking shortly afterward His ribs should still be tender but they hadnt ached in weeks His spheres and those of the other bridgemen near him had consistently run out of Stormlight Had it been the highstorm that had changed him But no hed discovered drained spheres before being hung out to die And Sylshed as much as admitted responsibility for some of what had happened This had been going on a long time He stopped beside a rock outcropping resting against it causing grass to shrink away He looked eastward over the Shattered Plains His home His sepulcher This life on them was ripping him apart The bridgemen looked up to him thought him their leader their savior But he had cracks in him like the cracks in the stone here at the edges of the Plains Those cracks were growing larger He kept making promises to himself like a man running a long distance with no energy left Just a little farther Run just to that next hill Then you can give up Tiny fractures fissures in the stone Its right that I came here he thought We belong together you and I Im like you What had made the Plains break in the first place Some kind of great weight A melody began playing distantly carrying over the Plains Kaladin jumped at the sound It was so unexpected so out of place that it was startling despite its softness The sounds were coming from the Plains Hesitant yet unable to resist he walked forward Eastward onto the flat windswept rock The sounds grew louder as he walked but they were still haunting elusive A flute though one lower in pitch than most hed heard As he grew closer Kaladin smelled smoke A light was burning out there A tiny campfire Kaladin walked out to the edge of this particular peninsula a chasm growing from the cracks until it plunged down into darkness At the very tip of the peninsulasurrounded on three sides by chasmKaladin found a man sitting on a boulder wearing a lighteyess black uniform A small fire of rockbud shell burned in front of him The mans hair was short and black his face angular He wore a thin blacksheathed sword at his waist The mans eyes were a pale blue Kaladin had never heard of a lighteyed man playing a flute Didnt they consider music a feminine pursuit Lighteyed men sang but they didnt play instruments unless they were ardents This man was extremely talented The odd melody he played was alien almost unreal like something from another place and time It echoed down the chasm and came back it almost sounded like the man was playing a duet with himself Kaladin stopped a short distance away realizing that the last thing he wanted to do now was deal with a brightlord particularly one who was eccentric enough to dress in black and wander out onto the Shattered Plains to practice his flute Kaladin turned to go The music cut off Kaladin paused I always worry that Ill forget how to play her a soft voice said from behind Its silly I know considering how long Ive practiced But these days I rarely give her the attention she deserves Kaladin turned toward the stranger His flute was carved from a dark wood that was almost black The instrument seemed too ordinary to belong to a lighteyes yet the man held it reverently What are you doing here Kaladin asked Sitting Occasionally playing I mean why are you here Why am I here the man asked lowering his flute leaning back and relaxing Why are any of us here Thats a rather deep question for a first meeting young bridgeman I generally prefer introductions before theology Lunch too if it can be found Perhaps a nice nap Actually practically anything should come before theology But especially introductions All right Kaladin said And you are Sitting Occasionally playing with the minds of bridgemen Kaladin reddened turning again to go Let the fool lighteyes say and do what he wished Kaladin had difficult decisions to think about Well off with you then the lighteyes said from behind Glad you are going Wouldnt want you too close Im rather attached to my Stormlight Kaladin froze Then he spun What My spheres the strange man said holding up what appeared to be a fully infused emerald broam Everyone knows that bridgemen are thieves or at least beggars Of course He had been talking about spheres He didnt know about Kaladins affliction Did he The mans eyes twinkled as if at a grand joke Dont be insulted at being called a thief the man said raising a finger Kaladin frowned Where had the sphere gone He had been holding it in that hand I meant it as a compliment A compliment Calling someone a thief Of course I myself am a thief You are What do you steal Pride the man said leaning forward And occasionally boredom if I may take the pride unto myself I am the Kings Wit Or I was until recently I think I shall probably lose the title soon The kings what Wit It was my job to be witty Saying confusing things isnt the same as being witty Ah the man said eyes twinkling Already you prove yourself more wise than most who have been my acquaintance lately What is it to be witty then To say clever things And what is cleverness I Why was he having this conversation I guess its the ability to say and do the right things at the right time The Kings Wit cocked his head then smiled Finally he held out his hand to Kaladin And what is your name my thoughtful bridgeman Kaladin hesitantly raised his own hand Kaladin And yours Ive many The man shook Kaladins hand I began life as a thought a concept words on a page That was another thing I stole Myself Another time I was named for a rock A pretty one I hope A beautiful one the man said And one that became completely worthless for my wearing it Well what do men call you now Many a thing and only some of them polite Almost all are true unfortunately You however you may call me Hoid Your name No The name of someone I should have loved Once again this is a thing I stole It is something we thieves do He glanced eastward over the rapidly darkening Plains The little fire burning beside Hoids boulder shed a fugitive light red from glimmering coals Well it was pleasant to meet you Kaladin said I will be on my way Not before I give you something Hoid picked up his flute Wait please Kaladin sighed He had a feeling that this odd man was not going to let him escape until he was done This is a Trailmans flute Hoid said inspecting the length of dark wood It is meant to be used by a storyteller for him to play while he is telling a story You mean to accompany a storyteller Being played by someone else while he speaks Actually I meant what I said How would a man tell a story while playing the flute Hoid raised an eyebrow then lifted the flute to his lips He played it differently from flutes Kaladin had seeninstead of holding it down in front of him Hoid held it out to the side and blew across its top He tested a few notes They had the same melancholy tone that Kaladin had heard before This story Hoid said is about Derethil and the Wandersail He began to play The notes were quicker sharper than the ones hed played earlier They almost seemed to tumble over one another scurrying out of the flute like children racing one another to be first They were beautiful and crisp rising and falling scales intricate as a woven rug Kaladin found himself transfixed The tune was powerful almost demanding As if each note were a hook flung out to spear Kaladins flesh and hold him near Hoid stopped abruptly but the notes continued to echo in the chasm coming back as he spoke Derethil is well known in some lands though I have heard him spoken of less here in the East He was a king during the shadowdays the time before memory A powerful man Commander of thousands leader of tens of thousands Tall regal blessed with fair skin and fairer eyes He was a man to envy Just as the echoes faded below Hoid began to play again picking up the rhythm He actually seemed to continue just where the echoing notes grew too soft as if there had never been a break in the music The notes grew more smooth suggesting a king walking through court with his attendants As Hoid played eyes closed he leaned forward toward the fire The air he blew over the flute churned the smoke stirring it The music grew softer The smoke swirled and Kaladin thought he could make out the face of a man in the patterns of smoke a man with a pointed chin and lofty cheekbones It wasnt really there of course Just imagination But the haunting song and the swirling smoke seemed to encourage his imagination Derethil fought the Voidbringers during the days of the Heralds and Radiants Hoid said eyes still closed flute just below his lips the song echoing in the chasm and seeming to accompany his words When there was finally peace he found he was not content His eyes always turned westward toward the great open sea He commissioned the finest ship men had ever known a majestic vessel intended to do what none had dared before sail the seas during a highstorm The echoes tapered off and Hoid began playing again as if alternating with an invisible partner The smoke swirled rising in the air twisting in the wind of Hoids breath And Kaladin almost thought he could see an enormous ship in a shipyard with a sail as large as a building secured to an arrowlike hull The melody became quick and clipped as if to imitate the sounds of mallets pounding and saws cutting Derethils goal Hoid paused and said was to seek the origin of the Voidbringers the place where they had been spawned Many called him a fool yet he could not hold himself back He named the vessel the Wandersail and gathered a crew of the bravest of sailors Then on a day when a highstorm brewed this ship cast off Riding out into the ocean the sail hung wide like arms open to the stormwinds The flute was at Hoids lips in a second and he stirred the fire by kicking at a piece of rockbud shell Sparks of flame rose in the air and smoke puffed swirling as Hoid rotated his head down and pointed the flutes holes at the smoke The song became violent tempestuous notes falling unexpectedly and trilling with quick undulations Scales rippled into high notes where they screeched airily And Kaladin saw it in his minds eye The massive ship suddenly miniscule before the awesome power of a highstorm Blown carried out into the endless sea What had this Derethil hoped or expected to find A highstorm on land was terrible enough But on the sea The sounds bounced off the echoing walls below Kaladin found himself sinking down to the rocks watching the swirling smoke and rising flames Seeing the tiny ship captured and held within a furious maelstrom Eventually Hoids music slowed and the violent echoes faded leaving a much gentler song Like lapping waves The Wandersail was nearly destroyed in the crash but Derethil and most of his sailors survived They found themselves on a ring of small islands surrounding an enormous whirlpool where it is said the ocean drains Derethil and his men were greeted by a strange people with long limber bodies who wore robes of single color and shells in their hair unlike any that grow back on Roshar These people took the survivors in fed them and nursed them back to health During his weeks of recovery Derethil studied the strange people who called themselves the Uvara the People of the Great Abyss They lived curious lives Unlike the people in Rosharwho constantly argue the Uvara always seemed to agree From childhood there were no questions Each and every person went about his duty Hoid began the music again letting the smoke rise unhindered Kaladin thought he could see in it a people industrious always working A building rose among them with a figure at the window Derethil watching The music was calming curious One day Hoid said while Derethil and his men were sparring to regain strength a young serving girl brought them refreshment She tripped on an uneven stone dropping the goblets to the floor and shattering them In a flash the other Uvara descended on the hapless child and slaughtered her in a brutal way Derethil and his men were so stunned that by the time they regained their wits the child was dead Angry Derethil demanded to know the cause of the unjustified murder One of the other natives explained Our emperor will not suffer failure The music began again sorrowful and Kaladin shivered He witnessed the girl being bludgeoned to death with rocks and the proud form of Derethil bowing above her fallen body Kaladin knew that sorrow The sorrow of failure of letting someone die when he should have been able to do something So many people he loved had died He had a reason for that now Hed drawn the ire of the Heralds and the Almighty It had to be that didnt it He knew he should be getting back to Bridge Four But he couldnt pull himself away He hung on the storytellers words As Derethil began to pay more attention Hoid said his music echoing softly to accompany him he saw other murders These Uvara these People of the Great Abyss were prone to astonishing cruelty If one of their members did something wrongsomething the slightest bit untoward or unfavorablethe others would slaughter him or her Each time he asked Derethils caretaker gave him the same answer Our emperor will not suffer failure The echoing music faded but once again Hoid lifted his flute just as it grew too soft to hear The melody grew solemn Soft quiet like a lament for one who had passed And yet it was edged with mystery occasional quick bursts hinting at secrets Kaladin frowned as he watched the smoke spin making what appeared to be a tower Tall thin with an open structure at the top The emperor Derethil discovered resided in the tower on the eastern coast of the largest island among the Uvara Kaladin felt a chill The smoke images were just from his mind adding to the story werent they Had he really seen a tower before Hoid mentioned it Derethil determined that he needed to confront this cruel emperor What kind of monster would demand that such an obviously peaceful people kill so often and so terribly Derethil gathered his sailors a heroic group and they armed themselves The Uvara did not try to stop them though they watched with fright as the strangers stormed the emperors tower Hoid fell silent and didnt turn back to his flute Instead he let the music echo in the chasm It seemed to linger this time Long sinister notes Derethil and his men came out of the tower a short time later carrying a desiccated corpse in fine robes and jewelry This is your emperor Derethil demanded We found him in the top room alone It appeared that the man had been dead for years but nobody had dared enter his tower They were too frightened of him When he showed the Uvara the dead body they began to wail and weep The entire island was cast into chaos as the Uvara began to burn homes riot or fall to their knees in torment Amazed and confused Derethil and his men stormed the Uvara shipyards where the Wandersail was being repaired Their guide and caretaker joined them and she begged to accompany them in their escape So it was that Nafti joined the crew Derethil and his men set sail and though the winds were still they rode the Wandersail around the whirlpool using the momentum to spin them out and away from the islands Long after they left they could see the smoke rising from the ostensibly peaceful lands They gathered on the deck watching and Derethil asked Nafti the reason for the terrible riots Hoid fell silent letting his words rise with the strange smoke lost to the night Well Kaladin demanded What was her response Holding a blanket around herself staring with haunted eyes at her lands she replied Do you not see Traveling One If the emperor is dead and has been all these years then the murders we committed are not his responsibility They are our own Kaladin sat back Gone was the taunting playful tone Hoid had used earlier No more mockery No more quick tongue intended to confuse This story had come from within his heart and Kaladin found he could not speak He just sat thinking of that island and the terrible things that had been done I think Kaladin finally replied licking his dry lips I think that is cleverness Hoid raised an eyebrow looking up from his flute Being able to remember a story like that Kaladin said to tell it with such care Be wary of what you say Hoid said smiling If all you need for cleverness is a good story then Ill find myself out of a job Didnt you say you were already out of a job True The king is finally without wit I wonder what that makes him Um witless Kaladin said Ill tell him you said that Hoid noted eyes twinkling But I think its inaccurate One can have a wit but not a witless What is a wit I dont know Some kind of spren in your head maybe that makes you think Hoid cocked his head then laughed Why I suppose thats as good an explanation as any He stood up dusting off his black trousers Is the story true Kaladin asked rising too Perhaps But how would we know it Did Derethil and his men return Some stories say they did But how could they The highstorms only blow one direction Then I guess the story is a lie I didnt say that No I said it Fortunately its the best kind of lie And what kind is that Why the kind I tell of course Hoid laughed then kicked out the fire grinding the last of the coals beneath his heel It didnt really seem there had been enough fuel to make the smoke Kaladin had seen What did you put in the fire Kaladin said To make that special smoke Nothing It was just an ordinary fire But I saw What you saw belongs to you A story doesnt live until it is imagined in someones mind What does the story mean then It means what you want it to mean Hoid said The purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think but to give you questions to think upon Too often we forget that Kaladin frowned looking westward back toward the warcamps They were alight now with spheres lanterns and candles It means taking responsibility Kaladin said The Uvara they were happy to kill and murder so long as they could blame the emperor It wasnt until they realized there was nobody to take the responsibility that they showed grief Thats one interpretation Hoid said A fine one actually So what is it you dont want to take responsibility for Kaladin started What People see in stories what theyre looking for my young friend He reached behind his boulder pulling out a pack and slinging it on his shoulder I have no answers for you Most days I feel I never have had any answers Ive come to your land to chase an old acquaintance but I end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead You said about me and responsibility Just an idle comment nothing more He reached over laying a hand on Kaladins shoulder My comments are often idle I never can get them to do any solid work Would that I could make my words carry stones That would be something to see He held out the dark wood flute Here Ive carried her for longer than youd believe were I to tell you the truth Take her for yourself But I dont know how to play it Then learn Hoid said pressing the flute into Kaladins hand When you can make the music sing back at you then youve mastered it He began to walk away And take good care of that blasted apprentice of mine He really should have let me know he was still alive Perhaps he feared Id come to rescue him again Apprentice Tell him I graduate him Hoid said still walking Hes a full Worldsinger now Dont let him get killed I spent far too long trying to force some sense into that brain of his Sigzil Kaladin thought Ill give him the flute he called after Hoid No you wont Hoid said turning walking backward as he left Its a gift to you Kaladin Stormblessed I expect you to be able to play it when next we meet And with that the storyteller turned and broke into a jog heading off toward the warcamps He didnt move to go up into them however His shadowed figure turned to the south as if he were intending to leave the camps Where was he going Kaladin looked down at the flute in his hand It was heavier than he had expected What kind of wood was it He rubbed its smooth length thinking I dont like him Syls voice said suddenly coming from behind Hes strange Kaladin spun to find her on the boulder sitting where Hoid had been a moment ago Syl Kaladin said How long have you been here She shrugged You were watching the story I didnt want to interrupt She sat with hands in her lap looking uncomfortable Syl Im behind what is happening to you she said voice soft Im doing it Kaladin frowned stepping forward Its both of us she said But without me nothing would be changing in you Im taking something from you And giving something in return Its the way it used to work though I cant remember how or when I just know that it was I Hush she said Im talking Sorry Im willing to stop it if you want she said But I would go back to being as I was before That scares me Floating on the wind never remembering anything for longer than a few minutes Its because of this tie between us that I can think again that I can remember what and who I am If we end it I lose that She looked up at Kaladin sorrowful He looked into those eyes then took a deep breath Come he said turning walking back down the peninsula She flew over becoming a ribbon of light floating idly in the air beside his head Soon they reached the place beneath the ridge leading to the warcamps Kaladin turned north toward Sadeass camp The cremlings had retreated to their cracks and burrows but many of the plants still continued to let their fronds float in the cool wind When he passed the grass pulled back in looking like the fur of some black beast in the night lit by Salas What responsibility are you avoiding He wasnt avoiding responsibility He took too much responsibility Lirin had said it constantly chastising Kaladin for feeling guilt over deaths he couldnt have prevented Though there was one thing he clung to An excuse perhaps like the dead emperor It was the soul of the wretch Apathy The belief that nothing was his fault the belief that he couldnt change anything If a man was cursed or if he believed he didnt have to care then he didnt need to hurt when he failed Those failures couldnt have been prevented Someone or something else had ordained them If Im not cursed Kaladin said softly then why do I live when others die Because of us Syl said This bond It makes you stronger Kaladin Then why cant it make me strong enough to help the others I dont know Syl said Maybe it can If I get rid of it Ill go back to being normal For what purpose so I can die with the others He continued to walk in the darkness passing lights above that made vague faint shadows on the stones in front of him The tendrils of fingermoss clumped in bunches Their shadows seemed arms He thought often about saving the bridgemen And yet as he considered he realized that he often framed saving them in terms of saving himself He told himself he wouldnt let them die because he knew what it would do to him if they did When he lost men the wretch threatened to take over because of how much Kaladin hated failing Was that it Was that why he searched for reasons why he might be cursed To explain his failure away Kaladin began to walk more quickly He was doing something good in helping the bridgemenbut he also was doing something selfish The powers had unsettled him because of the responsibility they represented He broke into a jog Before long he was sprinting But if it wasnt about himif he wasnt helping the bridgemen because he loathed failure or because he feared the pain of watching them die then it would be about them About Rocks affable gibes about Moashs intensity about Tefts earnest gruff ness or Peets quiet dependability What would he do to protect them Give up his illusions His excuses Seize whatever opportunity he could no matter how it changed him No matter how it unnerved him or what burdens it represented He dashed up the incline to the lumberyard Bridge Four was making their evening stew chatting and laughing The nearly twenty wounded men from other crews sat eating gratefully It was gratifying how quickly they had lost their holloweyed expressions and begun laughing with the other men The smell of spicy Horneater stew was thick in the air Kaladin slowed his jog coming to a stop beside the bridgemen Several looked concerned as they saw him panting and sweating Syl landed on his shoulder Kaladin sought out Teft The aging bridgeman sat alone below the barracks eaves staring down at the rock in front of him He hadnt noticed Kaladin yet Kaladin gestured for the others to continue then walked over to Teft He squatted down before the man Teft looked up in surprise Kaladin What do you know Kaladin said quietly intense And how do you know it I Teft said When I was a youth my family belonged to a secret sect that awaited the return of the Radiants I quit when I was just a youth I thought it was nonsense He was holding things back Kaladin could tell from the hesitation in his voice Responsibility How much do you know about what I can do Not much Teft said Just legends and stories Nobody really knows what the Radiants could do lad Kaladin met his eyes then smiled Well were going to find out ReShephir the Midnight Mother giving birth to abominations with her essence so dark so terrible so consuming She is here She watches me

leisurely on the crystaltopped table the other swirling wine in his cup Yellow wine He wasnt on duty today so he could indulge just a tad Wind ruffled his hair he was sitting with a group of other young lighteyes at the outdoor tables of an Outer Market wineshop The Outer Market was a collection of buildings that had grown up near the kings palace outside the warcamps An eclectic mix of people passed on the street below their terraced seating I should think that everyone shares your dislike Adolin Jakamav said leaning with both elbows on the table He was a sturdy man a lighteyes of the

once claim to me that you were nearly always right Yes Toral said And so if everyone were like me who would I make sport of Id dread being made so mundane by everyone elses competence Adolin smiled taking a drink of his wine He had a formal duel in the arena today and hed found that a cup of yellow beforehand helped him relax Well you neednt worry about me being right too often Toral I was sure Sadeas would move against my father It doesnt make sense Why wouldnt he Positioning perhaps Toral said He was a keen fellow known for his refined sense of taste Adolin always wanted him along when trying wines He wants to look strong He was strong Adolin said He gains no more by not moving against us Now Danlan said voice soft with a breathless quality to it I know that Im quite new to the warcamps and my assessment is bound to reflect my ignorance but You always say that you know Adolin said idly He liked her voice quite a bit I always say what That youre ignorant Adolin said However youre anything but Youre among the most clever women Ive met She hesitated looking oddly annoyed for a moment Then she smiled You shouldnt say such thingsAdolinwhen a woman is attempting humility Oh right Humility Ive forgotten that existed Too much time around Sadeass lighteyes Jakamav said eliciting another tinkling laugh from Inkima Anyway Adolin said Im sorry Please continue I was saying Danlan said that I doubt Sadeas would wish to start a war Moving against your father in such an obvious way would have done that wouldnt it Undoubtedly Adolin said So perhaps that is why he held himself back I dont know Toral said He could have cast shame on your family without attacking youhe could have implied for instance that youd been negligent and foolish in not protecting the king but that you hadnt been behind the assassination attempt Adolin nodded That still could have started a war Danlan said Perhaps Toral said But you have to admit Adolin that the Blackthorns reputation is a little less than impressive of late And what does that mean Adolin snapped Oh Adolin Toral said waving a hand and raising his cup for some more wine Dont be tiresome You know what Im saying and you also know I mean no insult by it Where is that serving woman One would think Jakamav added that after six years out here we could get a decent winehouse Inkima laughed at that too She was really getting annoying My fathers reputation is sound Adolin said Or have you not been paying attention to our victories lately Achieved with Sadeass help Jakamav said Achieved nonetheless Adolin said In the last few months my fathers saved not only Sadeass life but that of the king himself He fights boldly Surely you can see that previous rumors about him were absolutely unfounded All right all right Toral said No need to get upset Adolin We can all agree that your father is a wonderful man But you were the one who complained to us that you wanted to change him Adolin studied his wine Both of the other men at the table wore the sort of outfits Adolins father frowned upon Short jackets over colorful silk shirts Toral wore a thin yellow silk scarf at the neck and another around his right wrist It was quite fashionable and looked far more comfortable than Adolins uniform Dalinar would have said that the outfits looked silly but sometimes fashion was silly Bold different There was something invigorating about dressing in a way that interested others moving with the waves of style Once before joining his father at the war Adolin had loved being able to design a look to match a given day Now he had only two options summer uniform coat or winter uniform coat The serving maid finally arrived bringing two carafes of wine one yellow and one deep blue Inkima giggled as Jakamav leaned over and whispered something in her ear Adolin held up a hand to forestall the maid from filling his cup Im not sure I want to see my father change Not anymore Toral frowned Last week I know Adolin said That was before I saw him rescue Sadeas Every time I start to forget how amazing my father is he does something to prove me one of the ten fools It happened when Elhokar was in danger too Its like my father only acts like that when he really cares about something You imply that he doesnt really care about the war Adolin dear Danlan said No Adolin said Just that the lives of Elhokar and Sadeas might be more important than killing Parshendi The others took that for an explanation moving on toward other topics But Adolin found himself circling the thought He felt unsettled lately Being wrong about Sadeas was one cause the chance that they might actually be able to prove the visions right or wrong was another Adolin felt trapped Hed pushed his father to confront his own sanity and nowby what their last conversation had establishedhe had all but agreed to accept his fathers decision to step down if the visions proved false Everyone hates being wrong Adolin thought Except my father said hed rather be wrong if it would be better for Alethkar Adolin doubted many lighteyes would rather be proven mad than right Perhaps Eshava was saying But that doesnt change all of his foolish restrictions I wish he would step down Adolin started What What was that Eshava glanced at him Nothing Just seeing if you were attending the conversation Adolin No Adolin said Tell me what you were saying She shrugged looking at Toral Toral leaned forward You dont think the warcamps are ignoring what happens to your father during highstorms Adolin Word is that he should abdicate because of it That would be foolish Adolin said firmly Considering how much success hes showing in battle Stepping down would be far too much of an overreaction Danlan agreed Though Adolin I do wish you could get your father to relax all of these foolish restrictions our camp is under You and the other Kholin men would be able to truly join society again Ive tried he said checking the position of the sun Trust me And unfortunately I have a duel to prepare for If youll excuse me Some more of Sadeass sycophants Jakamav asked No Danlan said smiling Its Brightlord Resi Thereve been some vocal provocations from Thanadal and this might serve to shut his mouth She looked at Adolin fondly Ill meet you there Thanks he said rising doing up the buttons on his coat He kissed Danlans freehand waved to the others and trotted out onto the street That was something of an abrupt departure for me he thought Will they see how uncomfortable the discussion made me Probably not They didnt know him as Renarin did Adolin liked to be familiar with a large number of people but not terribly close with any of them He didnt even know Danlan that well yet He would make his relationship with her last though He was tired of Renarin teasing him for jumping in and out of courtships Danlan was very pretty it seemed the courtship could work He passed through the Outer Market Torals words weighing on him Adolin didnt want to become highprince He wasnt ready He liked dueling and chatting with his friends Leading the army was one thingbut as highprince hed have to think of other things Such as the future of the war on the Shattered Plains or protecting and advising the king That shouldnt have to be our problem he thought But it was as his father always said If they didnt do it who would The Outer Market was far more disorganized than the markets inside Dalinars warcamp Here the ramshackle buildingsmostly built of stone blocks quarried from nearbyhad grown up without any specific plan A large number of the merchants were Thaylen with their typical caps vests and long wagging eyebrows The busy market was one of the few places where soldiers from all ten warcamps mingled In fact that had become one of the main functions of the place it was neutral ground where men and women from different warcamps could meet It also provided a market that wasnt heavily regulated though Dalinar had stepped in to provide some rules once the marketplace had begun to show signs of lawlessness Adolin nodded to a passing group of Kholin soldiers in blue who saluted him They were on patrol halberds held at their shoulders helms gleaming Dalinars troops patrolled this place and his scribes watched over it All at his own cost His father didnt like the layout of the Outer Market or its lack of walls He said that a raid could be catastrophic to it that it violated the spirit of the Codes But it had been years since the Parshendi had raided the Alethi side of the Plains And if they did decide to strike at the warcamps the scouts and guards would give ample warning So what was the point of the Codes Adolins father acted as if they were vitally important Always be in uniform always be armed always stay sober Be ever vigilant while under threat of attack But there was no threat of attack As he walked through the market Adolin lookedreally lookedfor the first time and tried to see what it was his father was doing He could pick out Dalinars officers easily They wore their uniforms as commanded Blue coats and trousers with silver buttons knots on the shoulders for rank Officers who werent from Dalinars camp wore all kinds of clothing It was difficult to pick them out from the merchants and other wealthy civilians But that doesnt matter Adolin told himself again Because were not going to be attacked He frowned passing a group of lighteyes lounging outside another winehouse Much as hed just been doing Their clothingindeed their postures and mannerismsmade them look like they cared only about their revelry Adolin found himself annoyed There was a war going on Almost every day soldiers died They did so while lighteyes drank and chatted Maybe the Codes werent just about protecting against the Parshendi Maybe they were about something moreabout giving the men commanders they could respect and rely on About treating war with the gravity it deserved Maybe it was about not turning a war zone into a festival The common men had to remain on watch vigilant Therefore Adolin and Dalinar did the same Adolin hesitated in the street Nobody cursed at him or called for him to movethey could see his rank They just went around him I think I see now he thought Why had it taken him so long Disturbed he hurried on his way toward the days match I walked from Abamabar to Urithiru Dalinar said quoting from memory In this the metaphor and experience are one inseparable to me like my mind and memory One contains the other and though I can explain one to you the other is only for me Sadeassitting beside himraised an eyebrow Elhokar sat on Dalinars other side wearing his Shardplate Hed taken to that more and more sure that assassins were thirsting for his life Together they watched the men dueling down below at the bottom of a small crater that Elhokar had designated the warcamps dueling arena The rocky shelves running around the inside of the tenfoottall wall made excellent seating platforms Adolins duel hadnt started yet and the men who fought right now were lighteyes but not Shardbearers Their dulledged dueling swords were crusted with a white chalklike substance When one achieved a hit on the others padded armor it would leave a visible mark So wait Sadeas said to him This man who wrote the book Nohadon is his holy name Others call him Bajerden though were not certain whether that was actually his real name or not He decided to walk from where to where Abamabar to Urithiru Dalinar said I think it must have been a great distance from the way the story is told Wasnt he a king Yes But why Its confusing Dalinar said But listen Youll see He cleared his throat and continued I strode this insightful distance on my own and forbade attendants I had no steed beyond my wellworn sandals no companion beside a stout staff to offer conversation with its beats against the stone My mouth was to be my purse I stuffed it not with gems but with song When singing for sustenance failed me my arms worked well for cleaning a floor or hogpen and often earned me a satisfactory reward Those dear to me took fright for my safety and perhaps my sanity Kings they explained do not walk like beggars for hundreds of miles My response was that if a beggar could manage the feat then why not a king Did they think me less capable than a beggar Sometimes I think that I am The beggar knows much that the king can only guess And yet who draws up the codes for begging ordinances Often I wonder what my experience in lifemy easy life following the Desolation and my current level of comforthas given me of any true experience to use in making laws If we had to rely on what we knew kings would only be of use in creating laws regarding the proper heating of tea and cushioning of thrones Sadeas frowned at this In front of them the two swordsmen continued their duel Elhokar watched keenly He loved duels Bringing in sand to coat the floor of this arena had been one of his first acts at the Shattered Plains Regardless Dalinar said still quoting from The Way of Kings I made the trip andas the astute reader has already concludedsurvived it The stories of its excitements will stain a different page in this narrative for first I must explain my purpose in walking this strange path Though I was quite willing to let my family think me insane I would not leave the same as my cognomen upon the winds of history My family traveled to Urithiru via the direct method and had been awaiting me for weeks when I arrived I was not recognized at the gate for my mane had grown quite robust without a razor to tame it Once I revealed myself I was carried away primped fed worried over and scolded in precisely that order Only after all of this was through was I finally asked the purpose of my excursion Couldnt I have just taken the simple easy and common route to the holy city Exactly Sadeas interjected He could at the very least have ridden a horse For my answer Dalinar quoted I removed my sandals and proffered my callused feet They were comfortable upon the table beside my halfconsumed tray of grapes At this point the expressions of my companions proclaimed that they thought me daft and so I explained by relating the stories of my trip One after another like stacked sacks of tallew stored for the winter season I would make flatbread of them soon then stuff it between these pages Yes I could have traveled quickly But all men have the same ultimate destination Whether we find our end in a hallowed sepulcher or a paupers ditch all save the Heralds themselves must dine with the Nightwatcher And so does the destination matter Or is it the path we take I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it We are not creatures of destinations It is the journey that shapes us Our callused feet our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived In the end I must proclaim that no good can be achieved of false means For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement but in the method The Monarch must understand this he must not become so focused on what he wishes to accomplish that he diverts his gaze from the path he must take to arrive there Dalinar sat back The rock beneath them had been cushioned and augmented with wooden armrests and back supports The duel ended with one of the lighteyeswearing green as he was subject to Sadeasscoring a hit on the breastplate of the other leaving a long white mark Elhokar clapped his approval gauntleted hands clanking and both duelists bowed The winners victory would be recorded by the women sitting in the judging seats They also held the books of dueling code and would adjudicate disputes or infractions That is the end of your story I presume Sadeas said as the next two duelists walked out onto the sand It is Dalinar said And you have that entire passage memorized I likely got a few of the words wrong Knowing you that means you might have forgotten a single an or the Dalinar frowned Oh dont be so stiff old friend Sadeas said That was a compliment Of sorts What did you think of the story Dalinar asked as the dueling resumed It was ridiculous Sadeas said frankly waving for a servant to bring him some wine Yellow as it was yet morning He walked all that distance just to make the point that kings should consider the consequences of their commands It wasnt just to prove the point Dalinar said I thought that myself but Ive begun to see He walked because he wanted to experience the things his people did He used it as a metaphor but I think he really wanted to know what it was like to walk that far Sadeas took a sip of his wine then squinted up at the sun Couldnt we get an awning or something set up out here I like the sun Elhokar said I spend too much time locked away in those caves we call buildings Sadeas glanced at Dalinar rolling his eyes Much of The Way of Kings is organized like that passage I quoted you Dalinar said A metaphor from Nohadons lifea real event turned into an example He calls them the forty parables Are they all so ridiculous I think this one is beautiful Dalinar said softly I dont doubt that you do You always have loved sentimental stories He raised a hand That was also intended to be a compliment Of sorts Exactly Dalinar my friend you always have been emotional It makes you genuine It can also get in the way of levelheaded thinkingbut so long as it continues to prompt you to save my life I think I can live with it He scratched his chin I suppose by definition I would have to wouldnt I I guess The other highprinces think you are selfrighteous Surely you can see why I What could he say I dont mean to be Well you do provoke them Take for example the way you refuse to rise to their arguments or insults Protesting simply draws attention to the issue Dalinar said The finest defense of character is correct action Acquaint yourself with virtue and you can expect proper treatment from those around you You see there Sadeas said Who talks like that Dalinar does Elhokar said though he was still watching the dueling My father used to Precisely Sadeas said Dalinar friend the others simply can not accept that the things you say are serious They assume it must be an act And you What do you think of me I can see the truth Which is That you are a selfrighteous prude Sadeas said lightly But you come by it honestly Im certain you mean that to be a compliment too Actually this time Im just trying to annoy you Sadeas raised his cup of wine to Dalinar To the side Elhokar grinned Sadeas That was quite nearly clever Shall I have to name you the new Wit What happened to the old one Sadeass voice was curious even eager as if hoping to hear that tragedy had befallen Wit Elhokars grin became a scowl He vanished Is that so How disappointing Bah Elhokar waved a gauntleted hand He does this on occasion Hell return eventually Unreliable as Damnation itself that one If he didnt make me laugh so Id have replaced him seasons ago They fell silent and the dueling continued A few other lighteyesboth women and menwatched seated on the benchlike ridges Dalinar noted with discomfort that Navani had arrived and was chatting with a group of women including Adolins latest infatuation the auburnhaired scribe Dalinars eyes lingered on Navani drinking in her violet dress her mature beauty Shed recorded his most recent visions without complaint and seemed to have forgiven him for throwing her out of his rooms so sharply She never mocked him never acted skeptical He appreciated that Should he thank her or would she see that as an invitation He averted his gaze from her but found that he couldnt watch the dueling swordsmen without catching sight of her in the corner of his eye So instead he glanced up into the sky squinting against the afternoon sun The sounds of metal hitting metal came from below Behind him several large snails clung to the rock waiting for highstorm water He had so many questions so many uncertainties He listened to The Way of Kings and worked to discover what Gavilars last words had meant As if somehow they held the key to both his madness and the nature of the visions But the truth was that he didnt know anything and he couldnt rely on his own decisions That was unhinging him bit by bit point by point Clouds seemed less frequent here in these windswept plains Just the blazing sun broken by the furious highstorms The rest of Roshar was influenced by the stormsbut here in the East the feral untamed highstorms ruled supreme Could any mortal king hope to claim these lands There were legends of them being inhabited of there being more than just unclaimed hills desolate plains and overgrown forests Natanatan the Granite Kingdom Ah Sadeas said sounding as if hed tasted something bitter Did he have to come Dalinar lowered his head and followed Sadeass gaze Highprince Vamah had arrived to watch the dueling retinue in tow Though most of them wore his traditional brown and grey colorings the highprince himself wore a long grey coat that had slashes cut across it to reveal the bright red and orange silk underneath matched by the ruffles peeking out of the cuffs and collar I thought you had a fondness for Vamah Elhokar said I tolerate him Sadeas replied But his fashion sense is absolutely repulsive Red and orange Not even a burnt orange but a blatant eyebreaking orange And the rent style hasnt been fashionable for ages Ah wonderful hes sitting directly across from us I shall be forced to stare at him for the rest of the session You shouldnt judge people so harshly based on how they look Dalinar said Dalinar Sadeas said flatly we are highprinces We represent Alethkar Many around the world view us as a center of culture and influence Should I not therefore have the right to encourage a properpresentation to the world A proper presentation yes Dalinar said It is right for us to be fit and neat It would be nice if your soldiers for instance kept their uniforms clean Fit neat and fashionable Sadeas corrected And me Dalinar asked looking down at his simple uniform Would you have me dress in those ruffles and bright colors You Sadeas asked Youre completely hopeless He raised a hand to forestall objection No I am unfair That uniform has a certain timeless quality to it The military suit by virtue of its utility will never be completely out of fashion Its a safe choicesteady In a way you avoid the issue of fashion by not playing the game He nodded to Vamah Vamah tries to play but does so very poorly And that is unforgivable I still say you place too much importance on those silks and scarves Dalinar said We are soldiers at war not courtiers at a ball The Shattered Plains are quickly becoming a destination for foreign dignitaries It is important to present ourselves properly He raised a finger to Dalinar If I am to accept your moral superiority my friend then perhaps it is time for you to accept my sense of fashion One might note that you judge people by their clothing even more than I do Dalinar fell silent That comment stung in its truthfulness Still if dignitaries were going to meet with the highprinces on the Shattered Plains was it too much to ask for them to find an efficient group of warcamps led by men who at least looked like generals Dalinar settled back to watch the match end By his count it was time for Adolins bout The two lighteyes who had been fighting bowed to the king then withdrew into a tent on the side of the dueling grounds A moment later Adolin stepped out onto the sand wearing his deep blue Shardplate He carried his helm under his arm his blondandblack hair a stylish mess He raised a gauntleted hand to Dalinar and bowed his head to the king then put on his helm The man who walked out behind him wore Shardplate painted yellow Brightlord Resi was the only full Shardbearer in Highprince Thanadals armythough their warcamp had three men who carried only the Blade or the Plate Thanadal himself had neither It wasnt uncommon for a highprince to rely on his finest warriors as Shardbearers it made sound sense particularly if you were the sort of general who preferred to stay behind the lines and direct tactics In Thanadals own princedom the tradition for centuries had been to appoint the holder of Resis Shards as something known as the Royal Defender Thanadal had recently been vocal about Dalinars faults and so Adolin in a moderately subtle movehad challenged the highprinces star Shardbearer to a friendly bout Few duels were for Shards in this case losing wouldnt cost either man anything other than statistics in the rankings The match drew an unusual amount of attention and the small arena filled over the next quarter hour while the duelists stretched and prepared More than one woman set up a board to sketch or write impressions of the bout Thanadal himself didnt attend The bout began as the highjudge in attendance Lady Istow called for the combatants to summon their Blades Elhokar leaned forward again intent as Resi and Adolin circled one another on the sand Shardblades materializing Dalinar found himself leaning forward as well though he did feel a stab of shame According to the Codes most duels should be avoided when Alethkar was at war There was a fine line between sparring for practice and dueling another man for an insult potentially leaving important officers wounded Resi stood in Stonestance his Shardblade held before him in two hands point toward the sky arms all the way extended Adolin used Windstance turned sideways slightly hands before him and elbows bent Shardblade pointing back over his head They circled The winner would be the first one who completely shattered a section of the others Plate That wasnt too dangerous weakened Plate could usually still rebuff a blow even if it shattered in the process Resi attacked first taking a hopping leap forward and striking by whipping his Shardblade back over his head then down to his right in a powerful blow Stonestance focused on that type of attack delivering the most possible momentum and strength behind each strike Dalinar found it unwieldyyou didnt need that much power behind a Shardblade on the battlefield though it was helpful against other Shardbearers Adolin jumped back out of the way Shardplateenhanced legs giving him a nimbleness that defied the fact that he was wearing over a hundred stoneweights of thick armor Resis attackthough wellexecutedleft him open and Adolin made a careful strike at his opponents left vambrace cracking the forearm plate Resi attacked again and Adolin again danced out of the way then scored a hit on his opponents left thigh Some poets described combat as a dance Dalinar rarely felt that way about regular combat Two men fighting with sword and shield would go at one another in a furious rush slamming their weapons down again and again tying to get around their opponents shield Less a dance and more like wrestling with weapons Fighting with Shardblades though that could be like a dance The large weapons took a great deal of skill to swing properly and Plate was resilient so exchanges were generally drawn out The fights were filled with grand motions wide sweeps There was a fluidity to fighting with a Shardblade A grace Hes quite good you know Elhokar said Adolin made a hit on Resis helm prompting a round of applause from those watching Better than my father was Better than even you Uncle He works very hard Dalinar said He truly loves it Not the war not the fighting The dueling He could be champion if he wished it Adolin did wish it Dalinar knew But he had refused bouts that would put him within reach of the title Dalinar suspected that Adolin did it to hold somewhat to the Codes Dueling championships and tournaments were things for those rare times between wars It could be argued that protecting ones family honor however was for all times Either way Adolin didnt duel for ranking and that made other Shardbearers underestimate him They were quick to accept duels with him and some nonShardbearers challenged him By tradition the kings own Shardplate and Blade were available for a large fee to those who both had his favor and the wish to duel a Shardbearer Dalinar shivered at the thought of someone else wearing his Plate or holding Oathbringer It was unnatural And yet the lending of the kings Blade and Plateor before the kingship had been restored the lending of a highprinces Blade and Platewas a strong tradition Even Gavilar had not broken it though he had complained about it in private Adolin dodged another blow but he had begun to move into Windstances offensive forms Resi wasnt ready for thisthough he managed to hit Adolin once on the right pauldron the blow was a glancing one Adolin advanced Blade sweeping in a fluid pattern Resi backed away falling into a parrying postureStonestance was one of the few to rely on those Adolin batted his opponents Blade away knocking it out of stance Resi reset but Adolin knocked it away again Resi grew sloppier and sloppier getting back into stance and Adolin began to strike hitting him on one side then on the other Small quick blows meant to unnerve They worked Resi bellowed and threw himself into one of Stonestances characteristic overhand blows Adolin handled it perfectly dropping his Blade to one hand raising his left arm and taking the blow on his unharmed vambrace It cracked badly but the move allowed Adolin to bring his own Blade to the side and strike Resis cracked left cuisse The thigh plate shattered with the sound of ripping metal pieces blasting away trailing smoke glowing like molten steel Resi stumbled back his left leg could no longer bear the weight of the Shardplate The match was over More important duels might go for two or three broken plates but that grew dangerous The highjudge stood calling an end Resi stumbled away ripping off his helm His curses were audible Adolin saluted his enemy tapping the blunt edge of his Blade to his forehead then dismissing the Blade He bowed to the king Other men sometimes went into the crowd to brag or accept accolades but Adolin retreated to the preparation tent Talented indeed Elhokar said And such a proper lad Sadeas said sipping his drink Yes Dalinar said At times I wish there were peace simply so that Adolin could dedicate himself to his dueling Sadeas sighed More talk of abandoning the war Dalinar Thats not what I meant You keep complaining that youve given up that argument Uncle Elhokar said turning to regard him Yet you continue to dance around it speaking longingly of peace People in the camps call you coward Sadeas snorted Hes no coward Your Majesty I can attest to that Why then Elhokar asked These rumors have grown far beyond what is reasonable Dalinar said And yet you do not answer my questions Elhokar said If you could make the decision Uncle would you have us leave the Shattered Plains Are you a coward Dalinar hesitated Unite them that voice had told him It is your task and I give it to you Am I a coward he wondered Nohadon challenged him in the book to examine himself To never become so certain or high that he wasnt willing to seek truth Elhokars question hadnt been about his visions And yet Dalinar had the distinct impression that he was being a coward at least in relation to his desire to abdicate If he left because of what was happening to him that would be taking the easy path I cant leave he realized No matter what happens I have to see this through Even if he was mad Or an increasingly worrisome thought even if the visions were real but their origins suspect I have to stay But I also have to plan to make sure I dont tow my house down Such a careful line to walk Nothing clear everything clouded Hed been ready to run because he liked to make clear decisions Well nothing was clear about what was happening to him It seemed that in making the decision to remain highprince he placed one important cornerstone into rebuilding the foundation of who he was He would not abdicate And that was that Dalinar Elhokar asked Are you well Dalinar blinked realizing that he had stopped paying attention to the king and Sadeas Staring off into space like that wouldnt help his reputation He turned to the king You want to know the truth he said Yes if I could make the order I would bring all ten warcamps and return to Alethkar Despite what others said that was not cowardly No hed just confronted cowardice inside of him and he knew what it was This was something different The king looked shocked I would leave Dalinar said firmly But not because I wish to flee or because I fear battle It would be because I fear for Alethkars stability leaving this war would help secure our homeland and the loyalty of the highprinces I would send more envoys and scholars to find out why the Parshendi killed Gavilar We gave up on that too easily I still wonder if the assassination was initiated by miscreants or rebels among their own people Id discover what their culture isand yes they do have one If rebels werent the cause of the assassination Id keep asking until I learned why they did it Id demand repaymentperhaps their own king delivered to us for execution in turnin exchange for granting them peace As for the gemhearts Id speak with my scientists and discover a better method of holding this territory Perhaps with mass homesteading of the area securing all of the Unclaimed Hills we could truly expand our borders and claim the Shattered Plains I wouldnt abandon vengeance Your Majesty but I would approach itand our war heremore thoughtfully Right now we know too little to be effective Elhokar looked surprised He nodded I Uncle that actually makes sense Why didnt you explain it before Dalinar blinked Just several weeks ago Elhokar had been indignant when Dalinar had merely mentioned the idea of turning back What had changed I dont give the boy enough credit he realized I have had trouble explaining my own thoughts recently Your Majesty Your Majesty Sadeas said Surely you wouldnt actually consider This latest attempt on my life has me unsettled Sadeas Tell me Have you made any progress in determining who put the weakened gems in my Plate Not yet Your Majesty Theyre trying to kill me Elhokar said softly huddling down in his armor Theyll see me dead like my father Sometimes I do wonder if were chasing after the ten fools here The assassin in whitehe was Shin The Parshendi took responsibility for sending him Sadeas said Yes Elhokar replied And yet they are savages and easily manipulated It would be a perfect distraction pinning the blame on a group of parshmen We go to war for years and years never noticing the real villains working quietly in my own camp They watch me Always Waiting I see their faces in mirrors Symbols twisted inhuman Dalinar glanced at Sadeas and the two shared a disturbed look Was Elhokars paranoia growing worse or had it always been hidden He saw phantom cabals in every shadow and nowwith the attempt on his life he had proof to feed those worries Retreating from the Shattered Plains could be a good idea Dalinar said carefully But not if it is to begin another war with someone else We must stabilize and unify our people Elhokar sighed Chasing the assassin is only an idle thought right now Perhaps we wont need it I hear that your eff orts with Sadeas have been fruitful They have indeed Your Majesty Sadeas said sounding proudperhaps a little smug Though Dalinar still insists on using his own slow bridges Sometimes my forces are nearly wiped out before he arrives This would work better if Dalinar would use modern bridge tactics The waste of life Dalinar said Is acceptable Sadeas said Theyre mostly slaves Dalinar Its an honor for them to have a chance to participate in some small way I doubt they see it in that light I wish youd at least try my way Sadeas continued What weve been doing so far has worked but I worry that the Parshendi will continue to send two armies against us I dont relish the idea of fighting both on my own before you arrive Dalinar hesitated That would be a problem But to give up the siege bridges Well why not a compromise Elhokar said Next plateau assault Uncle you let Sadeass bridgemen help you for the initial march to the contested plateau Sadeas has plenty of extra bridge crews he could lend you He could still rush on ahead with a smaller army but youd follow more quickly than you have been using his bridge crews That would be the same as using my own bridge crews Dalinar said Not necessarily Elhokar said Youve said that the Parshendi can rarely set up and fire on you once Sadeas engages them Sadeass men can start the assault as usual and you can join once hes secured a foothold for you Yes Sadeas said thoughtful The bridgemen you use will be safe and you wont be costing any additional lives But youll arrive at the plateau to help me twice as quickly What if you cant distract the Parshendi well enough Dalinar asked What if they still set up archers to fire on my bridgemen when I cross Then well retreat Sadeas said with a sigh And well call it a failed experiment But at least well have tried This is how you get ahead old friend You try new things Dalinar scratched his chin in thought Oh go on Dalinar Elhokar said He took your suggestion to attack together Try it once his way Very well Dalinar said We will see how it works Excellent Elhokar said standing And now I believe Ill go congratulate your son That bout was exciting Dalinar hadnt found it particularly excitingAdolins opponent hadnt ever held the upper hand But that was the best kind of battle Dalinar didnt buy the arguments about a good fight being a close one When you won it was always better to win quickly and with extreme advantage Dalinar and Sadeas stood in respect as the king descended the stairlike stone outcroppings toward the sandy floor below Dalinar then turned to Sadeas I should be leaving Send me a clerk to detail the plateaus you feel we could try this maneuver on Next time one of them is up for assault Ill march my army to your staging area and well leave together You and the smaller quicker group can go on ahead and well catch up once youre in position Sadeas nodded Dalinar turned to climb up the steps toward the ramp out Dalinar Sadeas called after him Dalinar looked back at the other highprince Sadeass scarf fluttered in a gust of wind his arms folded the metallic golden embroidery glistening Send me one of your clerks as well With a copy of that book of Gavilars It may amuse me to hear its other stories Dalinar smiled I will do so Sadeas Above the final void I hang friends behind friends before The feast I must drink clings to their faces and the words I must speak spark in my mind The old oaths will be spoken anew Dated Betabanan 1173 45 seconds predeath Subject a lighteyed child of five years Diction improved remarkably when giving sample Kaladin glared at the three glowing topaz spheres on the ground in front of him The barrack was dark empty save for Teft and himself Lopen leaned in the sunlit doorway watching with a casual air Outside Rock called out commands to the other bridgemen Kaladin had them working on battle formations Nothing overt It would be construed as practice for bridge carrying but he was actually training them to obey orders and rearrange themselves efficiently The three little spheresonly chipslit the stone ground around themselves in little tan rings Kaladin focused on them holding his breath willing the light into him Nothing happened He tried harder staring into their depths Nothing happened He picked one up cupping it in his palm raising it so that he could see the light and nothing else He could pick out the details of the storm the shifting spinning vortex of light He commanded it willed it begged it Nothing happened He groaned lying back on the rock staring at the ceiling Maybe you dont want it badly enough Teft said I want it as badly as I know how It wont budge Teft Teft grunted and picked up one of the spheres Maybe were wrong about me Kaladin said It seemed poetically appropriate that the moment he accepted this strange frightening part of himself he couldnt make it work It could have been a trick of the sunlight A trick of the sunlight Teft said flatly Sticking a bag to the barrel was a trick of the light All right Then maybe it was some odd fluke something that happened just that once And when you were wounded Teft said and whenever on a bridge run you needed an extra burst of strength or endurance Kaladin let out a frustrated sigh and tapped his head back lightly against the rock floor a few times Well if Im one of these Radiants you keep talking about why cant I do anything I figure the grizzled bridgeman said rolling the sphere in his fingers that youre like a baby making his legs work At first it just kind of happens Slowly he figures how to make them move on purpose You just need practice Ive spent a week staring at spheres Teft How much practice can it take Well more than youve had obviously Kaladin rolled his eyes and sat back up Why am I listening to you Youve admitted that you dont know any more than I do I dont know anything about using the Stormlight Teft said scowling But I know what should happen According to stories that contradict one another Youve told me that the Radiants could fly and walk on walls Teft nodded They sure could And make stone melt by looking at it And move great distances in a single heartbeat And command the sunlight And And why Kaladin said would they need to both walk on walls and fly If they can fly why would they bother running up walls Teft said nothing And why bother with either one Kaladin added if they can just move great distances in a heartbeat Im not sure Teft admitted We cant trust the stories or legends Kaladin said He glanced at Syl who had landed beside one of the spheres staring at it with childlike interest Who knows what is true and what has been fabricated The only thing we know for certain is this He plucked up one of the spheres and held it up in two fingers The Radiant sitting in this room is very very tired of the color brown Teft grunted Youre not a Radiant lad Werent we just talking about Oh you can infuse Teft said You can drink in the Stormlight and command it But being a Radiant was more than that It was their way of life the things they did The Immortal Words The what Teft rolled his sphere between his fingers again holding it up and staring into its depths Life before death Strength before weakness Journey before destination That was their motto and was the First Ideal of the Immortal Words There were four others Kaladin raised an eyebrow Which were I dont actually know Teft said But the Immortal Wordsthese Idealsguided everything they did The four later Ideals were said to be different for every order of Radiants But the First Ideal was the same for each of the ten Life before death strength before weakness journey before destination He hesitated Or so I was told Yes well that seems a little obvious to me Kaladin said Life comes before death Just like day comes before night or one comes before two Obvious Youre not taking this seriously Maybe thats why the Stormlight refuses you Kaladin stood and stretched Im sorry Teft Im just tired Life before death Teft said wagging a finger at Kaladin The Radiant seeks to defend life always He never kills unnecessarily and never risks his own life for frivolous reasons Living is harder than dying The Radiants duty is to live Strength before weakness All men are weak at some time in their lives The Radiant protects those who are weak and uses his strength for others Strength does not make one capable of rule it makes one capable of service Teft picked up spheres putting them in his pouch He held the last one for a second then tucked it away too Journey before destination There are always several ways to achieve a goal Failure is preferable to winning through unjust means Protecting ten innocents is not worth killing one In the end all men die How you lived will be far more important to the Almighty than what you accomplished The Almighty So the knights were tied to religion Isnt everything There was some old king who came up with all this Had his wife write it in a book or something My mother read it The Radiants based the Ideals on what was written there Kaladin shrugged moving over to begin sorting through the pile of bridgemens leather vests Ostensibly he and Teft were here checking those over for tears or broken straps After a few moments Teft joined him Do you actually believe that Kaladin asked lifting up a vest tugging on its straps That anyone would follow those vows particularly a bunch of lighteyes They werent just lighteyes They were Radiants They were people Kaladin said Men in power always pretend things like virtue or divine guidance some kind of mandate to protect the rest of us If we believe that the Almighty put them where they are its easier for us to swallow what they do to us Teft turned a vest over It was beginning to tear beneath the left shoulder pad I never used to believe And then then I saw you infusing Light and I began to wonder Stories and legends Teft Kaladin said We want to believe that there were better men once That makes us think it could be that way again But people dont change They are corrupt now They were corrupt then Maybe Teft said My parents believed in all of it The Immortal Words the Ideals the Knights Radiant the Almighty Even old Vorinism In fact especially old Vorinism That led to the Hierocracy The devotaries and the ardents shouldnt hold land or property Its too dangerous Teft snorted Why You think theyd be worse at being in charge than the lighteyes Well youve probably got a point there Kaladin frowned Hed spent so long assuming the Almighty had abandoned him or even cursed him that it was difficult to accept that maybeas Syl had saidhed instead been blessed Yes hed been preserved and he supposed he should be grateful for that But what could be worse than being granted great power yet still being too weak to save those he loved Further speculation was interrupted as Lopen stood up straight in the doorway gesturing covertly to Kaladin and Teft Fortunately there wasnt anything to hide anymore In fact there hadnt ever been anything to hide other than Kaladin sitting on the floor and staring at the spheres like an idiot He set aside the vest and walked to the entrance Hashals palanquin was being carried directly toward Kaladins barrack her tall oftsilent husband walking alongside The sash at his neck was violet as was the embroidery on the cuffs of his short vestlike jacket Gaz still hadnt reappeared It had been a week now and no sign of him Hashal and her husbandalong with their lighteyed attendantsdid what hed once done and they rebuffed any questions about the bridge sergeant Storm it Teft said stepping up beside Kaladin Those two make my skin itch same way it does when I know someones got a knife and is standing behind me Rock had the bridgemen lined up and waiting quietly as if for inspection Kaladin walked out to join them Teft and Lopen following behind The bearers set the palanquin down in front of Kaladin Opensided with only a small canopy on the top it was little more than an armchair on a platform Many of the lighteyed women used them in the warcamps Kaladin reluctantly gave Hashal a proper bow prompting the other bridgemen to do so as well Now was not the time to be beaten for insubordination You have such a welltrained band bridgeleader she said idly scratching her cheek with a rubyred nail her elbow on her armrest So efficient at bridge runs Thank you Brightness Hashal Kaladin said tryingbut failingto keep the stiff ness and hostility from his voice May I ask Gaz hasnt been seen for some days now Is he well No Kaladin waited for further reply but she didnt give one My husband has made a decision Your men are so good at bridge runs that you are a model to the other crews As such you will be on bridge duty every day from now on Kaladin felt a chill And scavenging duty Oh there will still be time for that You need to take torches down anyway and plateau runs never happen at night So your men will sleep during the dayalways on calland will work the chasms at night A much better use of your time Every bridge run Kaladin said Youre going to make us go on every one Yes she said idly tapping for her bearers to raise her Your team is just too good It must be used Youll start fulltime bridge duty tomorrow Consider it an honor Kaladin inhaled sharply to keep himself from saying what he thought of her honor He couldnt bring himself to bow as she retreated but she didnt seem to care Rock and the men started muttering Every bridge run Shed just doubled the rate at which theyd be killed Kaladins team wouldnt last another few weeks They were already so low on members that losing one or two men on an assault would cause them to flounder The Parshendi would focus on them then cutting them down Keleks breath Teft said Shell see us dead Its not fair Lopen added Were bridgemen Kaladin said looking at them What made you think that any kind of fairness applied to us She hasnt killed us fast enough for Sadeas Moash said You know that soldiers have been beaten for coming to look for you to see the man who survived the highstorm He hasnt forgotten about you Kaladin Teft was still swearing He pulled Kaladin aside Lopen following but the others remained talking among themselves Damnation Teft said softly They like to pretend to be evenhanded with the bridge crews Makes em seem fair Looks like they gave up on that Bastards What do we do gancho Lopen asked We go to the chasms Kaladin said Just like were scheduled to Then make sure we get some extra sleep tonight as were apparently going to be staying up all night tomorrow The men will hate going into the chasms at night lad Teft said I know But were not ready for what we need to do Teft said looking to make sure nobody could hear It was only him Kaladin and Lopen It will be another few weeks at least I know We wont last another few weeks Teft said With Sadeas and Kholin working together runs happen nearly every day Just one bad runone time with the Parshendi drawing bead on usand it will all be over Well be wiped out I know Kaladin said frustrated taking a deep breath and forming fists to keep himself from exploding Gancho Lopen said What Kaladin snapped Its happening again Kaladin froze then looked down at his arms Sure enough he caught a hint of luminescent smoke rising from his skin It was extremely fainthe didnt have many gemstones near himbut it was there The wisps faded quickly Hopefully the other bridgemen hadnt seen Damnation What did I do I dont know Teft said Is it because you were angry at Hashal I was angry before You breathed it in Syl said eagerly whipping around him in the air a ribbon of light What I saw it She twisted herself around You were mad you drew in a breath and the Light it came too Kaladin glanced at Teft but of course the older bridgeman hadnt heard Gather the men Kaladin said Were going down to our chasm duty And what about what has happened Teft said Kaladin we cant go on that many bridge runs Well be cut to pieces Im doing something about it today Gather the men Syl I need something from you What She landed in front of him and formed into a young woman Go find us a place where some Parshendi corpses have fallen I thought you were going to do spear practice today Thats what the men will be doing Kaladin said Ill get them organized first After that I have a different task Kaladin clapped a quick signal and the bridgemen made a decent arrowhead formation They carried the spears theyd stashed in the chasm secured in a large sack filled with stones and stuck in a crevice He clapped his hands again and they rearranged into a doubleline wall formation He clapped again and they formed into a ring with one man standing behind every two as a quick stepin reserve The walls of the chasm dripped with water and the bridgemen splashed through puddles They were good Better than they had any right to be betterfor their level of trainingthan any team hed worked with But Teft was right They still wouldnt last long in a fight A few more weeks and hed have them practiced enough with thrusts and shielding one another that theyd begin to be dangerous Until then they were just bridgemen who could move in fancy patterns They needed more time Kaladin had to buy them some Teft Kaladin said Take over The older bridgeman gave one of those crossarmed salutes Syl Kaladin said to the spren lets go see these bodies Theyre close Come on She zipped off down the chasm a glowing ribbon Kaladin started after her Sir Teft called Kaladin hesitated When had Teft started calling him sir Odd how right that felt Yes You want an escort Teft stood at the head of the gathered bridgemen who were looking more and more like soldiers with their leather vests and spears held in practiced grips Kaladin shook his head Ill be fine Chasmfiends The lighteyes have killed any who prowl this close to our side Besides if I did run into one what difference would two or three extra men make Teft grimaced behind his short greying beard but offered no further objection Kaladin continued to follow Syl In his pouch he carried the rest of the spheres theyd discovered on bodies while scavenging They made a habit of keeping some of each discovery and sticking them to bridges and with Syl helping at scavenging they now found more than they used to He had a small fortune in his pouch That Stormlighthe hoped would serve him well today He got out a sapphire mark for light avoiding pools of water strewn with bones A skull protruded from one wavy green moss growing across the scalp like hair lifespren bobbing above Perhaps it should have felt eerie to walk through these darkened slots alone but they didnt bother Kaladin This was a sacred place the sarcophagus of the lowly the burial cavern of bridgemen and spearmen who died upon lighteyed edicts spilling blood down the sides of these ragged walls This place wasnt eerie it was holy He was actually glad to be alone with his silence and the remains of those who had died These men hadnt cared about the squabbles of those born with lighter eyes than they These men had cared about their families orat the very leasttheir sphere pouches How many of them were trapped in this foreign land these endless plateaus too poor to escape back to Alethkar Hundreds died each week winning gems for men who were already rich winning vengeance for a king long dead Kaladin passed another skull missing its lower jaw the crown split by an axes blow The bones seemed to watch him curious the blue Stormlight in his hand giving a haunted cast to the uneven ground and walls The devotaries taught that when men died the most valiant among themthe ones who fulfilled their Callings bestwould rise to help reclaim heaven Each man would do as he had done in life Spearmen to fight farmers to work spiritual farms lighteyes to lead The ardents were careful to point out that excellence in any Calling would bring power A farmer would be able to wave his hand and create great fields of spiritual crops A spearman would be a great warrior able to cause thunder with his shield and lightning with his spear But what of the bridgemen Would the Almighty demand that all of these fallen rise and continue their drudgery Would Dunny and the others run bridges in the afterlife No ardents came to them to test their abilities or grant them Elevations Perhaps the bridgemen wouldnt be needed in the War for Heaven Only the very most skilled went there anyway Others would simply slumber until the Tranquiline Halls were reclaimed So do I believe again now He climbed over a boulder wedged in the chasm Just like that He wasnt sure But it didnt matter He would do the best he could for his bridgemen If there was a Calling in that so be it Of course if he did escape with his team Sadeas would replace them with others who would die in their stead I have to worry about what I can do he told himself Those other bridgemen arent my responsibility Teft talked about the Radiants about ideals and stories Why couldnt men actually be like that Why did they have to rely on dreams and fabrications for inspiration If you flee you leave all the other bridgemen to be slaughtered a voice whispered within him There has to be something you can do for them No he fought back If I worry about that I wont be able to save Bridge Four If I find a way out were going If you leave the voice seemed to say then who will fight for them Nobody cares Nobody What was it his father had said all those years ago He did what he felt was right because someone had to start Someone had to take the first step Kaladins hand felt warm He stopped in the chasm closing his eyes You couldnt feel any heat from a sphere usually but the one in his hand seemed warm And thenfeeling completely natural about itKaladin breathed in deeply The sphere grew cold and a wave of heat shot up his arm He opened his eyes The sphere in his hand was dun and his fingers were crispy with frost Light rose from him like smoke from a fire white pure He raised a hand and felt alive with energy He had no need to breathe in fact he held the breath in trapping the Stormlight Syl zipped back down the corridor toward him She twisted around him then came to rest in the air taking the form of a woman You did it What happened Kaladin shook his head holding his breath Something was surging within him like Like a storm Raging inside his veins a tempest sweeping about inside his chest cavity It made him want to run jump yell It almost made him want to burst He felt as if he could walk on air Or walls Yes he thought He broke into a run leaping at the side of the chasm He hit feetfirst Then bounced off and slammed back into the ground He was so stunned that he cried out and he felt the storm within dampen as breath escaped He lay on his back as Stormlight rose from him more quickly now that he was breathing He lay there as the last of it burned away Syl landed on his chest Kaladin What was that Me being an idiot he replied sitting up and feeling an ache in his back and a sharp pain in his elbow where hed hit the ground Teft said that the Radiants were able to walk on walls and I felt so alive Syl walked on air stepping as if down a set of stairs I dont think youre ready for that yet Dont be so risky If you die I go stupid again you know Ill try to keep that in mind Kaladin said climbing to his feet Maybe Ill remove dying from my list of tasks to do this week She snorted zipping into the air becoming a ribbon again Come on hurry up She shot off down the chasm Kaladin collected the dun sphere then dug into the pouch for another one to provide light Had he drained them all No The others still glowed strongly He selected a ruby mark then hurried after Syl She led him to a narrow chasm that contained a small group of fresh Parshendi corpses This is morbid Kaladin Syl noted standing above the bodies I know Do you know where Lopen went I sent him scavenging nearby fetching the things you asked him for Bring him please Syl sighed but zipped away She always got testy when he made her appear to someone other than him Kaladin knelt down Parshendi all looked so similar That same square face those blockyalmost rocklikefeatures Some had the beards with bits of gemstone tied in them Those glowed but not brightly Cut gemstones held Stormlight better Why was that Rumors in camp claimed that the Parshendi took the wounded humans away and ate them Rumors also said they left their dead not caring for the fallen never building them proper pyres But that last part was false They did care about their dead They all seemed to have the same sensibility that Shen did he threw a fit every time one of the bridgemen so much as touched a Parshendi corpse Id better be right about this Kaladin thought grimly slipping a knife off one of the Parshendi bodies It was beautifully ornamented and forged the steel lined with glyphs Kaladin didnt recognize He began to cut at the strange breastplate armor that grew from the corpses chest Kaladin quickly determined that Parshendi physiology was very different from human physiology Small blue ligaments held the breastplate to the skin underneath It was attached all the way across He continued working There wasnt much blood it had pooled at the corpses back or leaked away His knife wasnt a surgeons tool but it did the job just fine By the time Syl returned with Lopen Kaladin had gotten the breastplate free and had moved on to the carapace helm It was harder to remove it had grown into the skull in places and he had to saw with the serrated section of the blade Ho gancho Lopen said a sack slung over his shoulder You dont like them at all do you Kaladin stood wiping his hands on the Parshendi mans skirt Did you find what I asked for Sure did Lopen said letting down the sack and digging into it He pulled out an armored leather vest and cap the type that spearmen used Then he took out some thin leather straps and a mediumsized wooden spearmans shield Finally came a series of deep red bones Parshendi bones At the very bottom of the sack was the rope the one Lopen had bought and tossed into the chasm then stashed down below You havent lost your wits have you Lopen asked eyeing the bones Because if you have Ive got a cousin who makes this drink for people whove lost their wits and it might make you better sure If Id lost my wits Kaladin said walking over to a pool of still water to wash off the carapace helm would I say that I had I dont know Lopen said leaning back Maybe Guess it doesnt matter if youre crazy or not Youd follow a crazy man into battle Sure Lopen said If youre crazy youre a good type and I like you Not a killingpeopleintheirsleep type of crazy He smiled Besides We all follow crazies all the time Do it every day with lighteyes Kaladin chuckled So whats this all for Kaladin didnt answer He brought the breastplate over to the leather vest then tied it onto the front with some of the leather straps He did the same with the cap and the helm though he eventually had to saw some grooves into the helm with his knife to make it stay Once done Kaladin used the last straps to tie the bones together and attach them to the front of the round wooden shield The bones rattled as he lifted the shield but he decided it was good enough He took shield cap and breastplate and put them all into Lopens sack They barely fit All right he said standing up Syl lead us to the short chasm Theyd spent some time investigating finding the best place to launch arrows into the bottom of permanent bridges One bridge in particular was close to Sadeass warcampso they often traversed it on the way out on a bridge runand spanned a particularly shallow chasm Only about forty feet deep rather than the usual hundred or more She nodded then zipped away leading them there Kaladin and Lopen followed Teft had orders to lead the others back and meet Kaladin at the base of the ladder but Kaladin and Lopen should be far ahead of them He spent the hike listening with half an ear as Lopen talked about his extended family The more Kaladin thought about what he was planning the more brazen it seemed Perhaps Lopen was right to question his sanity But Kaladin had tried being rational Hed tried being careful That had failed now there wasnt any more time for logic or care Hashal obviously intended Bridge Four to be exterminated When clever careful plans failed it was time to try something desperate Lopen cut off suddenly Kaladin hesitated The Herdazian man had grown palefaced and frozen in place What was Scraping Kaladin froze as well a panic rising in him One of the side corridors echoed with a deep grinding sound Kaladin turned slowly just in time to catch sight of something largeno something enormous moving down the distant chasm Shadows in the dim light the sound of chitinous legs scratching on rock Kaladin held his breath sweating but the beast didnt come in their direction The scraping grew softer then eventually faded He and Lopen stood immobile for a long time after the last sound had vanished Finally Lopen spoke Guess the nearby ones arent all dead eh gancho Yeah Kaladin said He jumped suddenly as Syl zipped back to find them He unconsciously sucked in Stormlight as he did so and when she alighted in the air she found him sheepishly glowing What is going on she demanded hands on hips Chasmfiend Kaladin said Really She sounded excited We should chase after it What Sure she said You could fight it Ill bet Syl Her eyes were twinkling with amusement Just a joke Come on She zipped away He and Lopen stepped more softly now Eventually Syl landed on the side of the chasm standing there as if in mockery of when Kaladin had tried to walk up the wall Kaladin looked up at the shadow of a wooden bridge forty feet above This was the shallowest chasm theyd been able to find they tended to get deeper and deeper the farther eastward you went More and more he was certain that trying to escape to the east was impossible It was too far and surviving the highstorm floods was too difficult a challenge The original planfighting or bribing the guards then runningwas the best one But they needed to live long enough to try that The bridge above offered an opportunity if Kaladin could reach it He hefted his small bag of spheres and his slung sack full of armor and bones over his shoulder Hed originally intended to have Rock shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it over the bridge then back down into the chasm With some men holding one end another could have climbed up and tied the sack to the bridges underside But that would risk letting an arrow shoot out of the chasm where scouts could see They were said to be very keeneyed as the armies depended on them to spot chasmfiends making chrysalises Kaladin thought he had a better way than the arrow Maybe We need rocks he said Fistsize ones A lot of them Lopen shrugged and began searching about Kaladin joined him fishing them out of puddles and pulling them from crevasses There was no shortage of stones in the chasms In a short time he had a large pile of rocks in a sack He took the pouch of spheres in his hand and tried to think the same way he had earlier when hed drawn in the Stormlight This is our last chance Life before death he whispered Strength before weakness Journey before destination The First Ideal of the Knights Radiant He breathed in deeply and a thick jolt of power shot up his arm His muscles burned with energy with the desire to move The tempest spread within pushing at his skin causing his blood to pump in a powerful rhythm He opened his eyes Glowing smoke rose around him He was able to contain much of the Light holding it in by holding his breath Its like a storm inside me It felt as if it would rip him apart He set the sack with the armor on the ground but wound the rope around his arm and tied the sack of rocks to his belt He took out a single fistsize stone and hefted it feeling its stormsmoothed sides This had better work He infused the stone with Stormlight frost crystallizing on his arm He wasnt sure how he did it but it felt natural like pouring liquid into a cup Light seemed to pool underneath the skin of his hand then transfer to the rockas if he were painting it with a vibrant glowing liquid He pressed the stone to the rock wall It fixed in place leaking Stormlight clinging so strongly that he couldnt pry it free He tested his weight on it and it held He placed another one a little lower then another a little higher Then wishing he had someone to burn him a prayer for success he started climbing He tried not to think about what he was doing Climbing on rocks stuck to the wall by what Light Spren He kept on going It was a lot like climbing the stone formations back near Hearthstone with Tien except that he could make handholds exactly where he wanted Should have found some rock dust to cover my hands he thought pulling himself up then taking another stone from his sack and sticking it into place Syl walked along beside him her casual stroll seeming to mock the difficulty of his climb As he shifted his weight to another rock he heard an ominous click from below He risked a glance downward The first of his rocks had fallen free The ones near it were leaking Stormlight only faintly now The rocks led up toward him like a set of burning footprints The storm inside him had quieted though it still blew and raged inside his veins thrilling and distracting at the same time What would happen if he ran out of Light before he reached the top The next rock fell free The one beside it followed a few seconds later Lopen stood on the other side of the chasm bottom leaning against the wall interested but relaxed Keep moving Kaladin thought annoyed at himself for getting distracted He turned back to his work Just as his arms were beginning to burn from the climb he reached the underside of the bridge He reached out as two more of his stones fell free The clatter of each one was louder now as they fell a much larger distance Steadying himself on the bottom of the bridge with one hand feet still pushing against the highest rocks he looped the end of the rope around a wooden bridge support He pulled it around and threaded it through again to make a makeshift knot He left plenty of extra rope on the short end He let the rest of the rope slide free of his shoulder and drop to the floor below Lopen he called Light steamed from his mouth as he spoke Pull it tight The Herdazian did so and Kaladin held to his end making the knot firm Then he took hold of the long section of rope and let himself swing free dangling from the bottom of the bridge The knot held Kaladin relaxed He was still steaming light andsave for the call to Lopenhed been holding his breath for a good quarter hour That could be handy he thought though his lungs were starting to burn so he started to breathe normally The Light didnt leave him altogether though it escaped faster All right Kaladin said to Lopen Tie the other sack to the bottom of the rope The rope wiggled and a few moments later Lopen called up that it was done Kaladin gripped the rope with his legs to hold himself in place then used his hands to pull up the length underneath hoisting up the sack full of armor Using the rope on the short end of the knot he slipped his pouch of dun spheres into the sack with the armor then tied it into place underneath the bridge wherehe hopedLopen and Dabbid would be able to get to it from above He looked down The ground looked so much more distant than it would have from the bridge above From this slightly different perspective everything changed He didnt get vertigo from the height Instead he felt a little surge of excitement Something about him had always liked being up high It felt natural It was being belowtrapped in holes and unable to see the world that was depressing He considered his next move What Syl asked stepping up to him standing on air If I leave the rope here someone might spot it while crossing the bridge So cut it free He looked at her raising an eyebrow While dangling from it Youll be fine Thats a fortyfoot drop Id break bones at the very least No Syl said I feel right about this Kaladin Youll be fine Trust me Trust you Syl youve said yourself that your memory is fractured You insulted me the other week she said folding her arms I think you owe me an apology Im supposed to apologize by cutting a rope and dropping forty feet No you apologize by trusting me I told you I feel right about this He sighed looking down again His Stormlight was running out What else could he do Leaving the rope would be foolish Could he tie it in another knot one he could shake free once at the bottom If that type of knot existed he didnt know how to tie it He clenched his teeth Then as the last of his rocks fell off and clattered to the ground he took a deep breath and pulled out the Parshendi knife hed taken earlier He moved swiftly before he had a chance to reconsider and sliced the rope free He dropped in a rush one hand still holding the sliced rope stomach lurching with the jarring distress of falling The bridge shot away as if rising and Kaladins panicked mind immediately sent his eyes downward This wasnt beautiful This was terrifying It was horrible He was going to die He Its all right His emotions calmed in a heartbeat Somehow he knew what to do He twisted in the air dropping the rope and hitting the ground with both feet down He came to a crouch resting one hand on the stone a jolt of coldness shooting through him His remaining Stormlight came out in a single burst flung from his body in a luminescent smoke ring that crashed against the ground before spreading out vanishing He stood up straight Lopen gaped Kaladin felt an ache in his legs from hitting but it was like that of having leaped four or five feet Like ten crashes of thunder on the mounts gancho Lopen exclaimed That was incredible Thank you Kaladin said He raised a hand to his head glancing at the rocks scattered about the base of the wall then looking up at the armor tied securely up above I told you Syl said landing on his shoulder She sounded triumphant Lopen Kaladin said You think you can get that bundle of armor during the next bridge run Sure Lopen said Nobody will see They ignore us Herdies they ignore bridgemen and they especially ignore cripples To them Im so invisible I should be walking through walls Kaladin nodded Get it Hide it Give it to me right before the final plateau assault They arent going to like you going into a bridge run armored gancho Lopen said I dont think this will be any different from what you tried before Well see Kaladin said Just do it The death is my life the strength becomes my weakness the journey has ended Dated Betabanes 1173 95 seconds predeath Subject a scholar of some minor renown Sample collected secondhand Considered questionable That is why Father Adolin said you absolutely can not abdicate to me no matter what we discover with the visions Is that so Dalinar asked smiling to himself Yes Very well youve convinced me Adolin stopped dead in the hallway The two of them were on their way to Dalinars chambers Dalinar turned and looked back at the younger man Really Adolin asked I mean I actually won an argument with you Yes Dalinar said Your points are valid He didnt add that hed come to the decision on his own No matter what I will stay I cant leave this fight now Adolin smiled broadly But Dalinar said raising a finger I have a requirement I will draft an ordernotarized by the highest of my scribes and witnessed by Elhokar that gives you the right to depose me should I grow too mentally unstable We wont let the other camps know of it but I will not risk letting myself grow so crazy that its impossible to remove me All right Adolin said walking up to Dalinar They were alone in the hallway I can accept that Assuming you dont tell Sadeas about it I still dont trust him Im not asking you to trust him Dalinar said pushing the door open to his chambers You just need to believe that he is capable of changing Sadeas was once a friend and I think he can be again The cool stones of the Soulcast chamber seemed to hold the chill of the spring weather It continued to refuse to slip into summer but at least it hadnt slid into winter either Elthebar promised that it would not do sobut then the stormwardens promises were always filled with caveats The Almightys will was mysterious and the signs couldnt always be trusted He accepted stormwardens now though when theyd first grown popular hed rejected their aid No man should try to know the future nor lay claim to it for it belonged only to the Almighty himself And Dalinar wondered how stormwardens could do their research without reading They claimed they didnt but hed seen their books filled with glyphs Glyphs They werent meant to be used in books they were pictures A man who had never seen one before could still understand what one meant based on its shape That made interpreting glyphs different from reading Stormwardens did a lot of things that made people uncomfortable Unfortunately they were just so useful Knowing when a highstorm might strike well that was just too tempting an advantage Even though stormwardens were frequently wrong they were more often right Renarin knelt beside the hearth inspecting the fabrial that had been installed there to warm the room Navani had already arrived She sat at Dalinars elevated writing desk scribbling a letter she waved a distracted greeting with her reed as Dalinar entered She wore the fabrial he had seen her displaying at the feast a few weeks back the multilegged contraption was attached to her shoulder gripping the cloth of her violet dress I dont know Father Adolin said closing the door Apparently he was still thinking about Sadeas I dont care if hes listening to The Way of Kings Hes just doing it to make you look less closely at the plateau assaults so that his clerks can arrange his cut of the gemhearts more favorably Hes manipulating you Dalinar shrugged Gemhearts are secondary son If I can reforge an alliance with him then its worth nearly any cost In a way Im the one manipulating him Adolin sighed Very well But Im still going to keep a hand on my money pouch when hes near Just try not to insult him Dalinar said Oh and something else I would like you to take extra care with the Kings Guard If there are soldiers we know for certain are loyal to me put those in charge of guarding Elhokars rooms His words about a conspiracy have me worried Surely you dont give them credence Adolin said Something odd did happen with his armor This whole mess stinks like cremslime Perhaps it will turn out to be nothing For now humor me I have to note Navani said that I didnt much care for Sadeas back when you he and Gavilar were friends She finished her letter with a flourish Hes not behind the attacks on the king Dalinar said How can you be certain Navani asked Because its not his way Dalinar said Sadeas never wanted the title of king Being highprince gives him plenty of power but leaves him with someone to take the blame for largescale mistakes Dalinar shook his head He never tried to seize the throne from Gavilar and hes even better positioned with Elhokar Because my sons a weakling Navani said It wasnt an accusation Hes not weak Dalinar said Hes inexperienced But yes that does make the situation ideal for Sadeas Hes telling the truthhe asked to be Highprince of Information because he wants very badly to find out who is trying to kill Elhokar Mashala Renarin said using the formal term for aunt That fabrial on your shoulder what does it do Navani looked down at the device with a sly smile Dalinar could see shed been hoping one of them would ask Dalinar sat down the highstorm would be coming soon Oh this Its a type of painrial Here let me show you She reached up with her safehand pushing a clip that released the clawlike legs She held it up Do you have any aches dear A stubbed toe perhaps or a scrape Renarin shook his head I pulled a muscle in my hand during dueling practice earlier Adolin said Its not bad but it does ache Come over here Navani said Dalinar smiled fondlyNavani was always at her most genuine when playing with new fabrials It was one of the few times when one got to see her without any pretense This wasnt Navani the kings mother or Navani the political schemer This was Navani the excited engineer The artifabrian community is doing some amazing things Navani said as Adolin proffered his hand Im particularly proud of this little device as I had a hand in its construction She clipped it onto Adolins hand wrapping the clawlike legs around the palm and locking them into place Adolin raised his hand turning it around The pain is gone But you can still feel correct Navani said in a selfsatisfied way Adolin prodded his palm with the fingers of his other hand The hand isnt numb at all Renarin watched with keen interest bespectacled eyes curious intense If only the lad could be persuaded to become an ardent He could be an engineer then if he wanted And yet he refused His reasons always seemed like poor excuses to Dalinar Its kind of bulky Dalinar noted Well its just an early model Navani said defensively I was working backward from one of those dreadful creations of Longshadows and I didnt have the luxury of refining the shape I think it has a lot of potential Imagine a few of these on a battlefield to dull the pain of wounded soldiers Imagine it in the hands of a surgeon who wouldnt have to worry about his patients pain while working on them Adolin nodded Dalinar had to admit it did sound like a useful device Navani smiled This is a special time to be alive were learning all kinds of things about fabrials This for instance is a diminishing fabrial it decreases something in this case pain It doesnt actually make the wound any better but it might be a step in that direction Either way its a completely different type from paired fabrials like the spanreeds If you could see the plans we have for the future Like what Adolin asked Youll find out eventually Navani said smiling mysteriously She removed the fabrial from Adolins hand Shardblades Adolin sounded excited Well no Navani said The design and workings of Shardblades and Plate are completely different from everything weve discovered The closest anyone has are those shields in Jah Keved But as far as I can tell they use a completely different design principle from regular Shardplate The ancients must have had a wondrous grasp of engineering No Dalinar said Ive seen them Navani Theyre well theyre ancient Their technology is primitive And the Dawncities Navani asked skeptically The fabrials Dalinar shook his head Ive seen neither There are Shardblades in the visions but they seem so out of place Perhaps they were given directly by the Heralds as the legends say Perhaps Navani said Why dont She vanished Dalinar blinked He hadnt heard the highstorm approaching He was now in a large open room with pillars running along the sides The enormous pillars looked sculpted of soft sandstone with unornamented granular sides The ceiling was far above carved from the rock in geometric patterns that looked faintly familiar Circles connected by lines spreading outward from one another I dont know what to do old friend a voice said from the side Dalinar turned to see a youthful man in regal white and gold robes walking with his hands clasped before him hidden by voluminous sleeves He had dark hair pulled back in a braid and a short beard that came to a point Gold threads were woven into his hair and came together on his forehead to form a golden symbol The symbol of the Knights Radiant They say that each time it is the same the man said We are never ready for the Desolations We should be getting better at resisting but each time we step closer to destruction instead He turned to Dalinar as if expecting a response Dalinar glanced down He too wore ornamental robes though not as lavish Where was he What time He needed to find clues for Navani to record and for Jasnah to use in provingor disprovingthese dreams I dont know what to say either Dalinar responded If he wanted information he needed to act more natural than he had in previous visions The regal man sighed I had hoped you would have wisdom to share with me Karm They continued walking toward the side of the room approaching a place where the wall split into a massive balcony with a stone railing It looked out upon an evening sky the setting sun stained the air a dirty sultry red Our own natures destroy us the regal man said voice soft though his face was angry Alakavish was a Surgebinder He should have known better And yet the Nahel bond gave him no more wisdom than a regular man Alas not all spren are as discerning as honorspren I agree Dalinar said The other man looked relieved I worried that you would find my claims too forward Your own Surgebinders were But no we should not look backward Whats a Surgebinder Dalinar wanted to scream the question out but there was no way Not without sounding completely out of place Perhaps What do you think should be done with these Surgebinders Dalinar asked carefully I dont know if we can force them to do anything Their footsteps echoed in the empty room Were there no guards no attendants Their power well Alakavish proves the allure that Surgebinders have for the common people If only there were a way to encourage them The man stopped turning to Dalinar They need to be better old friend We all do The responsibility of what weve been givenwhether it be the crown or the Nahel bondneeds to make us better He seemed to expect something from Dalinar But what I can read your disagreement in your face the regal man said Its all right Karm I realize that my thoughts on this subject are unconventional Perhaps the rest of you are right perhaps our abilities are proof of a divine election But if this is true should we not be more wary of how we act Dalinar frowned That sounded familiar to him The regal man sighed walking to the balcony lip Dalinar joined him stepping outside The perspective finally allowed him to look down on the landscape below Thousands of corpses confronted him Dalinar gasped Dead filled the streets of the city outside a city that Dalinar vaguely recognized Kholinar he thought My homeland He stood with the regal man at the top of a low tower three stories higha keep of some sort constructed of stone It seemed to sit where the palace would someday be The city was unmistakable with its peaked stone formations rising like enormous fins into the air The windblades they were called But they were less weathered than he was accustomed to and the city around them was very different Built of blocky stone structures many of which had been knocked down The destruction spread far lining the sides of primitive streets Had the city been hit by an earthquake No those corpses had fallen in battle Dalinar could smell the stench of blood viscera smoke The bodies lay strewn about many near the low wall that surrounded the keep The wall was broken in places smashed And there were rocks of strange shape mixed about the corpses Stones cut like Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought gripping the stone railing leading forward Those arent stones Theyre creatures Massive creatures easily five or six times the size of a person their skin dull and grey like granite They had long limbs and skeletal bodies the forelegsor were they armsset into wide shoulders The faces were lean narrow Arrowlike What happened here Dalinar asked despite himself Its terrible I ask myself this same thing How could we let this occur The Desolations are well named Ive heard initial counts Eleven years of war and nine out of ten people I once ruled are dead Do we even have kingdoms to lead any longer Sur is gone Im sure of it Tarma Eiliz they wont likely survive Too many of their people have fallen Dalinar had never heard of those places The man made a fist pounding it softly against the railing Burning stations had been set up in the distance they had begun cremating the corpses The others want to blame Alakavish And true if he hadnt brought us to war before the Desolation we might not have been broken this badly But Alakavish was a symptom of a greater disease When the Heralds next return what will they find A people who have forgotten them yet again A world torn by war and squabbling If we continue as we have then perhaps we deserve to lose Dalinar felt a chill He had thought that this vision must come after his previous one but prior visions hadnt been chronological He hadnt seen any Knights Radiant yet but that might not be because they had disbanded Perhaps they didnt exist yet And perhaps there was a reason this mans words sounded so familiar Could it be Could he really be standing beside the very man whose words Dalinar had listened to time and time again There is honor in loss Dalinar said carefully using words repeated several times in The Way of Kings If that loss brings learning The man smiled Using my own sayings against me again Karm Dalinar felt himself grow short of breath The man himself Nohadon The great king He was real Or he had been real This man was younger than Dalinar had imagined him but that humble yet regal bearing yes it was right Im thinking of giving up my throne Nohadon said softly No Dalinar stepped toward him You mustnt I can not lead them the man said Not if this is what my leadership brings them to Nohadon The man turned to him frowning What Dalinar paused Could he be wrong about this mans identity But no The name Nohadon was more of a title Many famous people in history had been given holy names by the Church before it was disbanded Even Bajerden wasnt likely to be his real name that was lost in time It is nothing Dalinar said You can not give up your throne The people need a leader They have leaders Nohadon said There are princes kings Soulcasters Surgebinders We never lack men and women who wish to lead True Dalinar said but we do lack ones who are good at it Nohadon leaned over the railing He stared at the fallen an expression of deep griefand troubleon his face It was so strange to see the man like this He was so young Dalinar had never imagined such insecurity such torment in him I know that feeling Dalinar said softly The uncertainty the shame the confusion You can read me too well old friend I know those emotions because Ive felt them I I never assumed that you would feel them too Then I correct myself Perhaps you dont know me well enough Dalinar fell silent So what do I do Nohadon asked Youre asking me Youre my advisor arent you Well I should like some advice I You cant give up your throne And what should I do with it Nohadon turned and walked along the long balcony It seemed to run around this entire level Dalinar joined him passing places where the stone was ripped the railing broken away I havent faith in people any longer old friend Nohadon said Put two men together and they will find something to argue about Gather them into groups and one group will find reason to oppress or attack another Now this How do I protect them How do I stop this from happening again You dictate a book Dalinar said eagerly A grand book to give people hope to explain your philosophy on leadership and how lives should be lived A book Me Write a book Why not Because its a fantastically stupid idea Dalinars jaw dropped The world as we know it has quite nearly been destroyed Nohadon said Barely a family exists that hasnt lost half its members Our best men are corpses on that field and we havent food to last more than two or three months at best And Im to spend my time writing a book Who would scribe it for me All of my wordsmen were slaughtered when Yelignar broke into the chancery Youre the only man of letters I know of whos still alive A man of letters This was an odd time I could write it then With one arm Have you learned to write lefthanded then Dalinar looked down He had both of his arms though apparently the man Nohadon saw was missing his right No we need to rebuild Nohadon said I just wish there were a way to convince the kingsthe ones still alivenot to seek advantage over one another Nohadon tapped the balcony So this is my decision Step down or do what is needed This isnt a time for writing Its a time for action And then unfortunately a time for the sword The sword Dalinar thought From you Nohadon It wouldnt happen This man would become a great philosopher he would teach peace and reverence for others and would not force men to do as he wished He would guide them to acting with honor Nohadon turned to Dalinar I apologize Karm I should not dismiss your suggestions right after asking for them Im on edge as I imagine that we all are At times it seems to me that to be human is to want that which we can not have For some this is power For me it is peace Nohadon turned walking back down the balcony Though his pace was slow his posture indicated that he wished to be alone Dalinar let him go He goes on to become one of the most influential writers Roshar has ever known Dalinar said There was silence save for the calls of the people working below gathering the corpses I know youre there Dalinar said Silence What does he decide Dalinar asked Did he unite them as he wanted The voice that often spoke in his visions did not come Dalinar received no answer to his questions He sighed turning to look out over the fields of dead You are right about one thing at least Nohadon To be human is to want that which we can not have The landscape darkened the sun setting That darkness enveloped him and he closed his eyes When he opened them he was back in his rooms standing with his hands on the back of a chair He turned to Adolin and Renarin who stood nearby anxious prepared to grab him if he got violent Well Dalinar said that was meaningless I learned nothing Blast Im doing a poor job of Dalinar Navani said curtly still scribbling with a reed at her paper The last thing you said before the vision ended What was it Dalinar frowned The last Yes Navani said urgent The very last words you spoke I was quoting the man Id been speaking with To be human is to want that which we can not have Why She ignored him writing furiously Once done she slid off the highlegged chair hurrying to his bookshelf Do you have a copy of Yes I thought you might These are Jasnahs books arent they Yes Dalinar said She wanted them cared for until she returned Navani pulled a volume off the shelf Corvanas Analectics She set the volume on the writing desk and leafed through the pages Dalinar joined her thoughof coursehe couldnt make sense of the page What does it matter Here Navani said She looked up at Dalinar When you go into these visions of yours you know that you speak Gibberish Yes my sons have told me Anak malah kaf del makian habin yah Navani said Sound familiar Dalinar shook his head baffled It sounds a lot like what father was saying Renarin said When he was in the vision Not a lot like Renarin Navani said looking smug Its exactly the same phrase That is the last thing you said before coming out of your trance I wrote down everythingas best I couldthat you babbled today For what purpose Dalinar asked Because Navani said I thought it might be helpful And it was The same phrase is in the Analectics almost exactly What Dalinar asked incredulous How Its a line from a song Navani said A chant by the Vanrial an order of artists who live on the slopes of the Silent Mount in Jah Keved Year after year century after century theyve sung these same wordssongs they claim were written in the Dawnchant by the Heralds themselves They have the words of those songs written in an ancient script But the meanings have been lost Theyre just sounds now Some scholars believe that the scriptand the songs themselvesmay indeed be in the Dawnchant And I Dalinar said You just spoke a line from one of them Navani said Beyond that if the phrase you just gave me is correct you translated it This could prove the Vanrial Hypothesis One sentence isnt much but it could give us the key to translating the entire script It has been itching at me for a while listening to these visions I thought the things you were saying had too much order to be gibberish She looked at Dalinar smiling deeply Dalinar you might just have cracked one of the most perplexingand ancient mysteries of all time Wait Adolin said What are you saying What Im saying nephew Navani said looking directly at him is that we have your proof But Adolin said I mean he could have heard that one phrase And extrapolated an entire language from it Navani said holding up a sheet full of writings This is not gibberish but its no language that people now speak I suspect it is what it seems the Dawnchant So unless you can think of another way your father learned to speak a dead language Adolin the visions are most certainly real The room fell silent Navani herself looked stunned by what she had said She shook it off quickly Now Dalinar she said I want you to describe this vision as accurately as possible I need the exact words you spoke if you can recall them Every bit we gather will help my scholars sort through this In the storm I awaken falling spinning grieving Dated Kakanev 1173 13 seconds predeath Subject was a city guardsman How can you be so sure it was him Dalinar Navani asked softly Dalinar shook his head I just am That was Nohadon It had been several hours since the end of the vision Navani had left her writing table to sit in a more comfortable chair near Dalinar Renarin sat across from him accompanying them for proprietys sake Adolin had left to get the highstorm damage report The lad had seemed very disturbed by the discovery that the visions were real But the man you saw never spoke his name Navani said It was him Navani Dalinar stared toward the wall over Renarins head looking at the smooth brown Soulcast rock There was an aura of command about him the weight of great responsibilities A regality It could have been some other king she said After all he discarded your suggestion that he write a book It just wasnt the time for him to write it yet So much death He was cast down by some great loss Stormfather Nine out of ten people dead in war Can you imagine such a thing The Desolations Navani said Unite the people The True Desolation comes Do you know of any references to the Desolations Dalinar asked Not the tales ardents tell Historical references Navani held a cup of warmed violet wine in her hand beads of condensation on the rim of the glass Yes but I am the wrong one to ask Jasnah is the historian I think I saw the aftermath of one I I may have seen corpses of Voidbringers Could that give us more proof Nothing nearly as good as the linguistics Navani took a sip of her wine The Desolations are matters of ancient lore It could be argued that you imagined what you expected to see But those wordsif we can translate them nobody will be able to dispute that you are seeing something real Her writing board lay on the low table between them reed and ink set carefully across the paper You intend to tell others Dalinar asked Of my visions How else will we explain what is happening to you Dalinar hesitated How could he explain On one hand it was relieving to know that he was not mad But what if some force were trying to mislead him with these visions using images of Nohadon and the Radiants because he would find them trustworthy The Knights Radiant fell Dalinar reminded himself They abandoned us Some of the other orders may have turned against us as the legends say There was an unsettling edge to all of that He had another stone in rebuilding the foundation of who he was but the most important point still remained undecided Did he trust his visions or not He couldnt go back to believing them unquestioningly not now that Adolins challenges had raised real worries in his head Until he knew their source he felt he shouldnt spread knowledge of them Dalinar Navani said leaning forward The warcamps speak of your episodes Even the wives of your officers are uncomfortable They think you fear the storms or that you have some disease of the mind This will vindicate you How By making me into some kind of mystic Many will think that the breeze of these visions blows too close to prophecy You see the past Father Renarin said That is not forbidden And if the Almighty sends them then how could men question Adolin and I both spoke with ardents Dalinar replied They said it was very unlikely that this would come from the Almighty If we do decide the visions are to be trusted many will disagree with me Navani settled back sipping her wine safehand lying across her lap Dalinar your sons told me that you once sought the Old Magic Why What did you ask of the Nightwatcher and what curse did she give you in return I told them that shame is my own Dalinar said And I will not share it The room fell silent The flurries of rain following the highstorm had ceased falling on the roof It might be important Navani finally said It was long ago Long before the visions began I dont think its related But it could be Yes he admitted Would that day never stop haunting him Was not losing all memory of his wife enough What did Renarin think Would he condemn his father for such an egregious sin Dalinar forced himself to look up and meet his sons bespectacled eyes Curiously Renarin didnt seem bothered Just thoughtful Im sorry you had to discover my shame Dalinar said looking to Navani She waved indifferently Soliciting the Old Magic is offensive to the devotaries but their punishments for the act are never severe I assume that you didnt have to do much to be cleansed The ardents asked for spheres to give the poor Dalinar said And I had to commission a series of prayers None of that removed the effects or my sense of guilt I think youd be surprised at how many devout lighteyes turn to the Old Magic at one point in their lives or another The ones who can make their way to the Valley at least But I do wonder if this is related Aunt Renarin said turning to her I have recently asked for a number of readings about the Old Magic I agree with his assessment This does not feel like the work of the Nightwatcher She gives curses in exchange for granting small desires Always one curse and one desire Father I assume you know what both of those things are Yes he said I know exactly what my curse was and it does not relate to this Then it is unlikely that the Old Magic is to blame Yes Dalinar said But your aunt is right to question The truth is we dont have any proof that this came from the Almighty either Something wants me to know of the Desolations and the Knights Radiant Perhaps we should start asking ourselves why that is What were the Desolations Aunt Renarin asked The ardents talk of the Voidbringers Of mankind and the Radiants and of fighting But what were they really Do we know anything specific There are folklorists among your fathers clerks who would serve you better in this matter Perhaps Dalinar added but Im not sure which of them I can trust Navani paused Fair enough Well from what I understand there are no primary accounts remaining This was long long ago I do recall that the myth of Parasaphi and Nadris mentions the Desolations Parasaphi Renarin said Shes the one who searched out the seedstones Yes Navani replied In order to repopulate her fallen people she climbed the peaks of Darathe myth changes listing different modern mountain ranges as the true peaks of Darato find stones touched by the Heralds themselves She brought them to Nadris on his deathbed and harvested his seed to bring life to the stones They hatched forth ten children which she used to found a new nation Marnah I believe it was called Origin of the Makabaki Renarin said Mother told me that story when I was a child Dalinar shook his head Born from rocks The old stories rarely made much sense to him although the devotaries had canonized many of them The story mentions the Desolations at the beginning Navani said Giving them credit for having wiped out Parasaphis people But what were they Wars Navani took a sip of wine The Voidbringers came again and again trying to force mankind off Roshar and into Damnation Just as they once forced mankindand the Heraldsout of the Tranquiline Halls When were the Knights Radiant founded Dalinar asked Navani shrugged I dont know Perhaps they were some military group from a specific kingdom or perhaps they were originally a mercenary band That would make it easy to see how they could eventually become tyrants My visions dont imply that they were tyrants he said Perhaps that is the true purpose of the visions To make me believe lies about the Radiants Making me trust them perhaps trying to lead me to mimic their downfall and betrayal I dont know Navani said sounding skeptical I dont think youve seen anything untrue about the Radiants The legends tend to agree that the Radiants werent always so bad As much as the legends agree on anything at least Dalinar stood and took her nearly empty cup then walked over to the serving table and refilled it Discovering that he was not mad should have helped clear things up but instead left him more disturbed What if the Voidbringers were behind the visions Some stories he heard said that they could possess the bodies of men and make them do evil Or if they were from the Almighty what was their purpose I need to think on all of this he said It has been a long day Please if I could be left to my own thoughts now Renarin rose and bowed his head in respect before heading to the door Navani rose more slowly sleek dress rustling as she set her cup on the table then walked over to fetch her paindrinking fabrial Renarin left and Dalinar walked to the doorway waiting as Navani approached He didnt intend to let her trap him alone again He looked out the doorway His soldiers were there and he could see them Good Arent you pleased at all Navani asked lingering beside the doorway near him one hand on the frame Pleased You arent going mad And we dont know if Im being manipulated or not he said In a way we have more questions now than we had before The visions are a blessing Navani said laying her freehand on his arm I feel it Dalinar Dont you see how wonderful this is Dalinar met her eyes light violet beautiful She was so thoughtful so clever How he wished he could trust her completely She has shown me nothing but honor he thought Never speaking a word to anyone else of my intention to abdicate She hasnt so much as tried to use my visions against me He felt ashamed that hed once worried that she might She was a wonderful woman Navani Kholin A wonderful amazing dangerous woman I see more worries he said And more danger But Dalinar youre having experiences scholars historians and folklorists could only dream about I envy you although you claim to have seen no fabrials of note The ancients didnt have fabrials Navani Im certain of it And that changes everything we thought we understood about them I suppose Stonefalls Dalinar she said sighing Does nothing bring you to passion any longer Dalinar took a deep breath Too many things Navani My insides feel like a mass of eels emotions squirming over one another The truth of these visions is unsettling Its exciting she corrected Did you mean what you said earlier About trusting me I said that You said you didnt trust your clerks and you asked me to record the visions Theres an implication in that Her hand was still on his arm She reached out with her safehand and closed the door to the hallway He almost stopped her but he hesitated Why The door clicked closed They were alone And she was so beautiful Those clever excitable eyes alight with passion Navani Dalinar said forcing down his desire Youre doing it again Why did he let her Yes I am she said Im a stubborn woman Dalinar There didnt seem to be any playfulness in her tone This is not proper My brother He reached for the door to open it again Your brother Navani spat expression flashing with anger Why must everyone always focus on him Everyone always worries so much about the man who died Hes not here Dalinar Hes gone I miss him But not half as much as you do it appears I honor his memory Dalinar said stiffly hesitating hand on the doors latch Thats fine Im happy you do But its been six years and all anyone can see me as is the wife of a dead man The other women they humor me with idle gossip but they wont let me into their political circles They think Im a relic You wanted to know why I came back so quickly I I returned she said because I have no home Im expected to sit out of important events because my husband is dead Lounge around pampered but ignored I make them uncomfortable The queen the other women at court Im sorry Dalinar said But I dont She raised her freehand tapping him on the chest I wont take it from you Dalinar We were friends before I even met Gavilar You still know me as me not some shadow of a dynasty that crumbled years ago Dont you She looked at him pleading Blood of my fathers Dalinar thought with shock Shes crying Two small tears He had rarely seen her so sincere And so he kissed her It was a mistake He knew it was He grabbed her anyway pulling her into a rough tight embrace and pressing his mouth to hers unable to contain himself She melted against him He tasted the salt of her tears as they ran down to her lips and met his It lasted long Too long Wonderfully long His mind screamed at him like a prisoner chained in a cell and forced to watch something horrible But a part of him had wanted this for decadesdecades spent watching his brother court marry and then hold the only woman that the young Dalinar had ever wanted Hed told himself he would never allow this He had denied himself feelings for Navani the moment Gavilar had won her hand Dalinar had stepped aside But the taste of herthe smell of her the warmth of her pressed against himwas too sweet Like a blossoming perfume it washed away the guilt For a moment that touch banished everything He couldnt remember his fear at the visions his worry about Sadeas his shame at past mistakes He could only think of her Beautiful insightful delicate yet strong at once He clung to her something he could hold onto as the rest of the world churned around him Eventually he broke the kiss She looked up at him dazed Passionspren like tiny flakes of crystalline snow floated down in the air around them Guilt flooded him again He tried gently to push her away but she clung to him holding on tight Navani he said Hush She pressed her head against his chest We cant Hush she said more insistently He sighed but let himself hold her Something is going wrong in this world Dalinar Navani said softly The king of Jah Keved was assassinated I heard it just today He was killed by a Shin Shardbearer in white clothing Stormfather Dalinar said Somethings going on she said Something bigger than our war here something bigger than Gavilar Have you heard of the twisted things men say when they die Most ignore it but surgeons are talking And stormwardens whisper that the highstorms are growing more powerful I have heard he said finding it difficult to get the words out intoxicated by her as he was My daughter seeks something Navani said She frightens me sometimes Shes so intense I honestly believe shes the most intelligent person Ive ever known And the things she searches for Dalinar she believes that something very dangerous is near The sun approaches the horizon The Everstorm comes The True Desolation The Night of Sorrows I need you Navani said Ive known it for years though I feared it would destroy you with guilt so I fled But I couldnt stay away Not with the way they treat me Not with what is happening to the world Im terrified Dalinar and I need you Gavilar was not the man everyone thought him to be I was fond of him but he Please Dalinar said dont speak ill of him Very well Blood of my fathers He couldnt get her scent out of his head He felt paralyzed holding to her like a man clinging to a stone in the stormwinds She looked up at him Well let it be saidthenthat I was fond of Gavilar But Im more than fond of you And Im tired of waiting He closed his eyes How can this work Well find a way Well be denounced The warcamps already ignore me Navani said and they spread rumors and lies about you What more can they do to us Theyll find something As of yet the devotaries do not condemn me Gavilar is dead Navani said resting her head back against his chest I was never unfaithful while he lived though the Stormfather knows I had ample reason The devotaries can say what they wish but The Arguments do not forbid our union Tradition is not the same as doctrine and I will not hold myself back for fear of offending Dalinar took a deep breath then forced himself to open his arms and pull back If you had hoped to soothe my worries for the day then this didnt help She folded her arms He could still feel where her safehand had touched him on the back A tender touch reserved for a family member Im not here to soothe you Dalinar Quite the opposite Please I do need time to think I wont let you put me away I wont ignore that this happened I wont Navani he gently cut her off I will not abandon you I promise She eyed him then a wry smile crept onto her face Very well But you began something today I began it he asked amused elated confused worried and ashamed at the same time The kiss was yours Dalinar she said idly pulling open the door and entering his antechamber You seduced me to it What Seduced She glanced back at him Dalinar Ive never been more open and honest in my life I know Dalinar said smiling That was the seductive part He closed the door softly then let out a sigh Blood of my fathers he thought why cant these things ever be simple And yet in direct contrast with his thoughts he felt as if the entire world had somehow become more right for having gone wrong The darkness becomes a palace Let it rule Let it rule Kakevah 1173 22 seconds predeath A darkeyed Selay man of unknown profession You think one of those will save us Moash asked scowling as he looked at the prayer tied about Kaladins upper right arm Kaladin glanced to the side He stood at parade rest as Sadeass soldiers crossed their bridge The chilly spring air felt good now that hed started working The sky was bright cloudless and the stormwardens promised that no highstorm was near The prayer tied on his arms was simple Three glyphs wind protection beloved A prayer to Jezerezehthe Stormfatherto protect loved ones and friends It was the straightforward type his mother had preferred For all her subtlety and wryness whenever shed knitted or written a prayer it had been simple and heartfelt Wearing it reminded him of her I cant believe you paid good money for that Moash said If there are Heralds watching they dont pay any mind to bridgemen Ive been feeling nostalgic lately I guess The prayer was probably meaningless but hed had reason to start thinking more about religion lately The life of a slave made it difficult for many to believe that anyone or anything was watching Yet many bridgemen had grown more religious during their captivity Two groups opposite reactions Did that mean some were stupid and others were callous or something else entirely Theyre going to see us dead you know Drehy said from behind This is it The bridgemen were exhausted Kaladin and his team had been forced to work the chasms all night Hashal had put strict requirements on them demanding an increased amount of salvage In order to meet the quota theyd forgone training to scavenge And then today theyd been awakened for a morning chasm assault after only three hours of sleep They were drooping as they stood in line and they hadnt even reached the contested plateau yet Let it come Skar said quietly from the other side of the line They want us dead Well Im not going to back down Well show them what courage is They can hide behind our bridges while we charge Thats no victory Moash said I say we attack the soldiers Right now Our own troops Sigzil said turning his darkskinned head and looking down the line of men Sure Moash said eyes still forward Theyre going to kill us anyway Lets take a few of them with us Damnation why not charge Sadeas His guard wont expect it Ill bet we could knock down a few and grab their spears then be on to killing lighteyes before they cut us down A couple of bridgemen murmured their assent as the soldiers continued to cross No Kaladin said It wouldnt accomplish anything Theyd have us dead before we could so much as inconvenience Sadeas Moash spat And this will accomplish something Damnation Kaladin I feel like Im already dangling from the noose I have a plan Kaladin said He waited for the objections His other plans hadnt worked No one offered a complaint Well then Moash said What is it Youll see today Kaladin said If it works it will buy us time If it fails Ill be dead He turned to look down the line of faces In that case Teft has orders to lead you on an escape attempt tonight Youre not ready but at least youll have a chance That was far better than attacking Sadeas as he crossed Kaladins men nodded and Moash seemed content As contrary as hed been originally he had grown equally loyal He was hotheaded but he was also the best with the spear Sadeas approached riding his roan stallion wearing his red Shardplate helm on but visor up By chance he crossed on Kaladins bridge thoughas alwayshe had twenty to choose from Sadeas didnt give Bridge Four so much as a glance Break and cross Kaladin ordered after Sadeas was over The bridgemen crossed their bridge and Kaladin gave the orders for them to pull it behind them then lift It felt heavier than it ever had before The bridgemen broke into a trot rounding the army column and hustling to reach the next chasm In the distance behind a second armyone in bluewas following them crossing using some of Sadeass other bridge crews It looked like Dalinar Kholin had given up his bulky mechanical bridges and was now using Sadeass own bridge crews to cross So much for his honor and not sacrificing bridgeman lives In his pouch Kaladin carried a large number of infused spheres obtained from the moneychangers in exchange for a greater quantity of dun spheres He hated taking that loss but he needed the Stormlight They reached the next chasm quickly It would be the nexttolast one according to the word hed gotten from Matal Hashals husband The soldiers began checking their armor stretching anticipationspren rising in the air like small streamers The bridgemen set their bridge and stepped back Kaladin noted Lopen and silent Dabbid approaching with their stretcher waterskins and bandages inside Lopen had hitched the stretcher to a hook at his waist making up for his missing arm The two moved among the members of Bridge Four giving them water As he passed Kaladin Lopen nodded toward the large bulge at the stretchers center The armor When do you want it Lopen asked softly lowering the litter then handing Kaladin a waterskin Right before we run the assault Kaladin replied You did well Lopen Lopen winked A onearmed Herdazian is still twice as useful as a nobrained Alethi Plus so long as Ive got one hand I can still do this He covertly made a rude gesture toward the marching soldiers Kaladin smiled but was growing too nervous to feel mirth It had been a long time since hed gotten jitters going into a battle He thought Tukks had beaten that out of him years ago Hey a sudden voice called I need some of that Kaladin spun to see a soldier walking over He was exactly the type of man Kaladin had known to avoid back in Amarams army Darkeyed but of modest rank he was naturally large and had probably gotten promoted by sheer virtue of size His armor was well maintained but the uniform beneath was stained and wrinkled and he kept the sleeves rolled up exposing hairy arms At first Kaladin assumed that the man had seen Lopens gesture But the man didnt seem mad He shoved Kaladin aside then pulled the waterskin away from Lopen Nearby the soldiers waiting to cross had noticed Their own water crews were much slower and more than a few of the waiting men eyed Lopen and his waterskins It would set a terrible precedent to let the soldiers take their waterbut that was a tiny problem compared with the greater one If those soldiers swarmed around the litter to get water theyd discover the sack full of armor Kaladin moved quickly snatching the waterskin from the soldiers hand You have your own water crews The soldier looked at Kaladin as if completely unable to believe that a bridgeman was standing up to him He scowled darkly lowering his spear to his side its butt against the ground I dont want to wait How unfortunate Kaladin said stepping right up to the man meeting him eye to eye Silently he cursed the idiot If it turned into a scuffle The soldier hesitated even more astonished to see such an aggressive threat from a bridgeman Kaladin wasnt as thickarmed as this man but he was a finger or two taller The soldiers uncertainty showed in his face Just back down Kaladin thought But no Backing down from a bridgeman while his squad was watching The man made a fist knuckles cracking Within seconds the entire bridge crew was there The soldier blinked as Bridge Four formed around Kaladin in an aggressive inverted wedge pattern moving naturallysmoothlyas Kaladin had trained them Each one made fists giving the soldier ample chance to see that the heavy lifting had trained these men to a physical level beyond that of the average soldier The man glanced back at his squad as if looking for support Do you want to spark a fight now friend Kaladin asked softly If you hurt the bridgemen I wonder who Sadeas will make run this bridge The man glanced back at Kaladin was silent for a moment then scowled cursed and stalked away Probably full of crem anyway he muttered rejoining his team The members of Bridge Four relaxed though they received more than a few appreciative looks from the other soldiers in line For once there was something other than scowls Hopefully they wouldnt realize that a squad of bridgemen had quickly and accurately made a battle formation commonly used in spear fighting Kaladin waved for his men to stand down nodding his thanks They fell back and Kaladin tossed the recovered waterskin back to Lopen The shorter man smirked wryly Ill keep a tighter grip on these things from now on gancho He eyed the soldier who had tried to take the water What Kaladin asked Well Ive got a cousin in the water crews you see Lopen said And Im thinking that he might owe me a favor on account of this one time I helped his sisters friend escape a guy looking for her You do have a lot of cousins Never enough You bother one of us you bother us all Thats something you strawheads never seem to get No offense or anything gancho Kaladin raised an eyebrow Dont make trouble for the soldier Not today Ill make enough of that myself here soon Lopen sighed but nodded All right For you He held up a waterskin You sure you dont want any Kaladin didnt his stomach was too unsettled But he made himself take the waterskin back and drink a few mouthfuls Before long the time came to cross and pull the bridge up for the last run The assault Sadeass soldiers were forming ranks lighteyes riding back and forth calling orders Matal waved Kaladins crew forward Dalinar Kholins army had fallen behind coming more slowly because of his larger numbers Kaladin took his place at the very front of his bridge Ahead the Parshendi were lined up with bows on the edge of their plateau staring down the oncoming assault Were they singing already Kaladin thought he could hear their voices Moash was on Kaladins right Rock on his left Only three on the deathline because of how shorthanded they were Hed put Shen in the very back so he wouldnt see what Kaladin was about to do Im going to duck out from underneath once we start moving Kaladin told them Rock you take over Keep them running Very well Rock said It will be hard to carry without you We have so few men and we are very weak Youll manage Youll have to Kaladin couldnt see Rocks face not positioned under the bridge as they were but his voice sounded troubled This thing you will try is dangerous Perhaps Can I help Im afraid not my friend But it strengthens me to hear you ask Rock didnt get a chance to reply Matal yelled for the bridge crews to go Arrows shot overhead to distract the Parshendi Bridge Four broke into a run And Kaladin ducked down and dashed out in front of them Lopen was waiting to the side and he tossed Kaladin the sack of armor Matal screamed at Kaladin in a panic but the bridge crews were already in motion Kaladin focused on his goal protecting Bridge Four and sucked in sharply Stormlight flooded him from the pouch at his waist but he didnt draw too much Just enough to give him a jolt of energy Syl zipped in front of him a ripple in the air nearly invisible Kaladin whipped the tie off the sack pulling out the vest and throwing it awkwardly over his head He ignored the ties at the side getting on the helm as he leaped over a small rock formation The shield came last clattering with red Parshendi bones in a crisscross pattern on the front Even while donning the armor Kaladin easily stayed far ahead of the heavily laden bridge crews His Stormlightinfused legs were quick and sure The Parshendi archers directly ahead of him abruptly stopped singing Several of them lowered their bows and though it was too distant to make out their faces he could sense their outrage Kaladin had expected this Hed hoped for it The Parshendi left their dead Not because they were uncaring but because they found it a terrible offense to move them Merely touching the dead seemed a sin If that was the case a man desecrating corpses and wearing them into battle would be far far worse As Kaladin grew closer a different song started among the Parshendi archers A quick violent song more chant than melody Those who had lowered their bows raised them And they tried with everything they had to kill him Arrows flew at him Dozens of them They werent fired in careful waves They flew individually rapidly wildly each archer loosing at Kaladin as quickly as he could A swarm of death bore down on him Pulse racing Kaladin ducked to the left leaping off a small outcropping Arrows sliced the air around him dangerously close But while infused with the Stormlight his muscles reacted quickly He dodged between arrows then turned in the other direction moving erratically Behind Bridge Four came into range and not a single arrow was fired at them Other bridge crews were ignored as well many of the archers focusing on Kaladin The arrows came more swiftly spraying around him bouncing off his shield One sliced open his arm as it shot past another snapped against his helm nearly knocking it free The arm wound leaked Light not blood and to Kaladins amazement it slowly began to seal up frost crystallizing on his skin and Stormlight draining from him He drew in more infusing himself to the cusp of glowing visibly He ducked he dodged he jumped he ran His battletrained reflexes delighted in the newfound speed and he used the shield to knock arrows out of the air It was as if his body had longed for this ability as if it had been born to take advantage of the Stormlight During the earlier part of his life he had lived sluggish and impotent Now he was healed Not acting beyond his capacitiesno finally reaching them A flock of arrows sought his blood but Kaladin spun between them taking another slice on the arm but deflecting the others with shield or breastplate The flight came and he brought his shield up worried that he was going to be too slow However the arrows changed course arcing toward his shield slamming into it Drawn to it Im pulling them to it He remembered dozens of bridge runs with arrows slamming into the wood near where his hands had clung to the support bars Always just missing him How long have I been doing this Kaladin thought How many arrows did I draw to the bridge pulling them away from me He didnt have time to think about that He kept moving dodging He felt arrows whish through the air heard them zip felt the splinters as they hit stone or shield and broke Hed hoped that he would distract some of the Parshendi from firing on his men but hed had no idea how strong a reaction hed get Part of him exulted in the thrill of ducking dodging and blocking the hail of arrows He started to slow however He tried to suck in Stormlight but none came His spheres were drained He panicked still dodging but then the arrowfalls began to slacken With a start Kaladin realized that the bridge crews had parted around him leaving a space for him to keep dodging while they passed him and set their burdens Bridge Four was in place cavalry charging across to attack the archers Despite that some of the Parshendi continued to fire on Kaladin enraged The soldiers cut these Parshendi down easily sweeping the ground of them and making room for Sadeass foot soldiers Kaladin lowered his shield It bristled with arrows He barely had time to take a fresh breath of air as the bridgemen reached him calling out with joy nearly tackling him in their excitement You fool Moash said You storming fool What was that What were you thinking Was incredible Rock said You should be dead Sigzil said though his normally stern face was split by a smile Stormfather Moash added pulling an arrow from Kaladins vest at the shoulder Look at these Kaladin looked down shocked to find a dozen arrow holes in the sides of his vest and shirt where hed narrowly avoided being hit Three arrows stuck from the leather Stormblessed Skar said Thats all there is too it Kaladin shrugged off their praise his heart still pounding He was numb Amazed that hed survived cold from the Stormlight hed consumed exhausted as if hed run a rigorous obstacle course He looked to Teft raising an eyebrow nodding toward the pouch at his waist Teft shook his head Hed watched the Stormlight rising from Kaladin hadnt been visible to those observing not in the light of day Still the way Kaladin had dodged would have looked incredible even without the obvious light If there had been stories about him before they would grow greatly following this He turned to look at the passing troops As he did he realized something He still had to deal with Matal Fall into line men he said They obeyed reluctantly falling into place around him in a double rank Ahead Matal stood beside their bridge He looked concerned as well he should Sadeas was riding up Kaladin steeled himself remembering how his previous victorywhen theyd run with the bridge on its sidehad been turned on its head He hesitated then hurried over toward the bridge where Sadeas was going to ride past Matal Kaladins men followed Kaladin arrived as Matal bowed to Sadeas who wore his glorious red Shardplate Kaladin and the bridgemen bowed as well Avarak Matal Sadeas said He nodded toward Kaladin This man looks familiar He is the one from before Brightlord Matal said nervous The one who Ah yes Sadeas said The miracle And you sent him forward as a decoy like that One would think that you would be hesitant to dare such measures I take full responsibility Brightlord Matal said putting the best face on it Sadeas regarded the battlefield Well luckily for you it worked I suppose Ill have to promote you now He shook his head Those savages practically ignored the assault force All twenty bridges set most with nary a casualty It seems like a waste somehow Consider yourself commended Most remarkable the way that boy dodged He kicked his horse into motion leaving Matal and the bridgemen behind It was the most backhanded promotion Kaladin had ever heard but that would do Kaladin smiled broadly as Matal turned to him eyes enraged You Matal sputtered You could have gotten me executed Instead I got you promoted Kaladin said Bridge Four forming around him I should see you strung up anyway Its been tried Kaladin said Didnt work Besides you know that from now on Sadeas is going to expect me to be out there distracting the archers Good luck getting any other bridgeman to try that Matals face grew red He turned and stalked away to check on the other bridge crews The two nearestBridge Seven and Bridge Eighteenstood looking toward Kaladin and his team All twenty bridges had been set Hardly any casualties Stormfather Kaladin thought How many archers were firing at me You did it Kaladin Moash exclaimed You found the secret We need to make this work Expand it Ill bet I could dodge those arrows if that were all I was doing Skar said With enough armor We should have more than one Moash agreed Five or so running around drawing the Parshendi attacks The bones Rock said folding his arms This is what made it work The Parshendi were so mad that they ignored bridge crew If all five wear the bones of Parshendi That made Kaladin consider something He looked back searching through the bridgemen Where was Shen There He was sitting on the rocks distant staring forward Kaladin approached with the others The parshman looked up at him face a mask of pain tears streaking his cheeks He looked at Kaladin and shuddered visibly turning away closing his eyes He sat down like that the moment he saw what youd done lad Teft said rubbing his chin Might not be good for bridge runs anymore Kaladin pulled the carapacetied helm off his head then ran his fingers through his hair The carapace stuck to his clothing stank faintly even though hed washed it off down below Well see Kaladin said feeling a twist of guilt Not nearly enough to overshadow the victory of protecting his men but enough to dampen it at least For now there are still many bridge crews that got fired upon You know what to do The men nodded trotting off to search for the wounded Kaladin set one man to watch over Shenhe wasnt sure what else to do with the parshmanand tried not to show his exhaustion as he put his sweaty carapacecovered cap and vest in Lopens litter He knelt down to go through his medical equipment in case it was needed and found that his hand was shaking and quivering He pressed it down against the ground to still it breathing in and out Cold clammy skin he thought Nausea Weakness He was in shock You all right lad Teft asked kneeling down beside Kaladin He still wore a bandage on his arm from the wound hed taken a few bridge runs back but it wasnt enough to stop him from carrying Not when there were too few as it was Ill be fine Kaladin said taking out a waterskin holding it in a quivering hand He could barely get the top off You dont look Ill be fine Kaladin said again drinking then lowering the water Whats important is that the men are safe You going to do this every time Whenever we go to battle Whatever keeps them safe Youre not immortal Kaladin Teft said softly The Radiants they could be killed just like any man Sooner or later one of those arrows will find your neck instead of your shoulder The Stormlight heals The Stormlight helps your body heal Thats different Im thinking Teft laid a hand on Kaladins shoulder We cant lose you lad The men need you Im not going to avoid putting myself in danger Teft And Im not going to leave the men to face a storm of arrows if I can do something about it Well Teft said you are going to let a few of us go out there with you The bridge can manage with twentyfive if it has to That leaves us a few extra just like Rock said And Ill bet some of those wounded from the other crews we saved are well enough to begin helping carry They wont dare send them back to their own crews not so long as Bridge Four is doing what you did today and helping the whole assault work I Kaladin trailed off He could imagine Dallet doing something like this Hed always said that as sergeant part of his job was to keep Kaladin alive All right Teft nodded rising You were a spearman Teft Kaladin said Dont try to deny it How did you end up here in these bridge crews Its where I belong Teft turned away to supervise the search for wounded Kaladin sat down then lay back waiting for the shock to wear off To the south the other armyflying the blue of Dalinar Kholinhad arrived They crossed to an adjacent plateau Kaladin closed his eyes to recover Eventually he heard something and opened his eyes Syl sat crosslegged on his chest Behind her Dalinar Kholins army had begun an assault onto the battlefield and they managed to do so without getting fired on Sadeas had the Parshendi cut off That was amazing Kaladin said to Syl What I did with the arrows Still think youre cursed No I know Im not He looked up at the overcast sky But that means the failures were all just me I let Tien die I failed my spearmen the slaves I tried to rescue Tarah He hadnt thought of her in some time His failure with her had been different from the others but a failure it was nonetheless If theres no curse or bad luck no god above being angry at meI have to live with knowing that with a little more eff orta little more practice or skillI could have saved them Syl frowned more deeply Kaladin you need to get over this Those things arent your fault Thats what my father always used to say He smiled faintly Overcome your guilt Kaladin Care but not too much Take responsibility but dont blame yourself Protect save helpbut know when to give up Theyre such precarious ledges to walk How do I do it I dont know I dont know any of this Kaladin But youre ripping yourself apart Inside and out Kaladin stared at the sky above It was wondrous I was a storm Syl The Parshendi couldnt touch me The arrows were nothing Youre too new to this You pushed yourself too hard Save them Kaladin whispered Do the impossible Kaladin But dont push yourself too hard But also dont feel guilty if you fail Precarious ledges Syl So narrow Some of his men returned with a wounded man a squarefaced Thaylen fellow with an arrow in the shoulder Kaladin went to work His hands were still shaking slightly but not nearly as badly as they had been The bridgemen clustered around watching Hed started training Rock Drehy and Skar already but with all of them watching Kaladin found himself explaining If you put pressure here you can slow the blood flow This isnt too dangerous a wound though it probably doesnt feel too goodthe patient grimaced his agreementand the real problem will come from infection Wash the wound to make sure there arent any slivers of wood or bits of metal left then sew it The muscles and skin of the shoulder here are going to get worked so you need a strong thread to hold the wound together Now Kaladin Lopen said sounding worried Wha Kaladin said distracted still working Kaladin Lopen had called him by his name rather than saying gancho Kaladin stood up turning to see the short Herdazian man standing at the back of the crowd pointing at the chasm The battle had moved farther north but a group of Parshendi had punched through Sadeass line They had bows Kaladin watched stunned as the group of Parshendi fell into formation and nocked Fifty arrows all pointed at Kaladins crew The Parshendi didnt seem to care that they were exposing themselves to attack from behind They seemed focused on only one thing Destroying Kaladin and his men Kaladin screamed the alarm but he felt so sluggish so tired The bridgemen around him turned as the archers drew Sadeass men normally defended the chasm to keep Parshendi from pushing over the bridges and cutting off their escape But this time noticing that the archers werent trying to drop the bridges the soldiers didnt hasten to stop them They left the bridgemen to die instead cutting off the Parshendi route to the bridges themselves Kaladins men were exposed Perfect targets No Kaladin thought No It cant happen like this Not after A force crashed into the Parshendi line A single figure in slategrey armor wielding a sword as long as many men were tall The Shardbearer swept through the distracted archers with urgency slicing into their ranks Arrows flew toward Kaladins team but they were loosed too early aimed poorly A few came close as the bridgemen ducked for cover but nobody was hit Parshendi fell before the sweeping Blade of the Shardbearer some toppling into the chasm others scrambling back The rest died with burnedout eyes In seconds the squad of fifty archers had been reduced to corpses The Shardbearers honor guard caught up with him He turned armor seeming to glow as he raised his Blade in a salute of respect toward the bridgemen Then he charged off in another direction That was him Drehy said standing up Dalinar Kholin The kings uncle He saved us Lopen said Bah Moash dusted himself off He just saw a group of undefended archers and took the chance to strike Lighteyes dont care about us Right Kaladin Kaladin stared at the place where the archers had stood In one moment he could have lost it all Kaladin Moash said Youre right Kaladin found himself saying Just an opportunity taken Except why raise the Blade toward Kaladin From now on Kaladin said we pull back farther after the soldiers cross They used to ignore us after the battle began but they wont any longer What I did todaywhat were all going to be doing soonwill make them mighty angry Angry enough to be stupid but also angry enough to see us dead For now Leyten Narm find good scouting points and watch the field I want to know if any Parshendi make moves toward that chasm Ill get this man bandaged and well pull back The two scouts ran off and Kaladin turned back to the man with the wounded shoulder Moash knelt beside him An assault against a prepared foe without any bridges lost a Shardbearer coincidentally coming to our rescue Sadeas himself complimenting us You almost make me think I should get one of those armbands Kaladin glanced down at the prayer It was stained with blood from a slice on his arm that the vanishing Stormlight hadnt quite been able to heal Wait to see if we escape Kaladin finished his stitching Thats the real test I wish to sleep I know now why you do what you do and I hate you for it I will not speak of the truths I see Kakashah 1173 142 seconds predeath A Shin sailor left behind by his crew reportedly for bringing them ill luck Sample largely useless You see Leyten turned the piece of carapace over in his hands If we carve it up at the edge it encourages a bladeor in this case an arrowto deflect away from the face Wouldnt want to spoil that pretty grin of yours Kaladin smiled taking back the piece of armor Leyten had carved it expertly putting in holes for leather straps to affix it to the jerkin The chasm was cold and dark at night With the sky hidden it felt like a cavern Only the occasional sparkle of a star high above revealed otherwise How soon can you have them done he asked Leyten All five By the end of the night likely The real trick was discovering how to work it He knocked on the carapace with the back of his knuckles Amazing stuff Nearly as hard as steel but half the weight Hard to cut or break But if you drill it shapes easily Good Kaladin said Because I dont want five sets I want one for each man in the crew Leyten raised an eyebrow If theyre going to start letting us wear armor Kaladin said everyone gets a suit Except Shen of course Matal had agreed to let them leave him behind on the bridge runs he wouldnt even look at Kaladin now Leyten nodded All right then Better get me some help though You can use the wounded men Well cart out as much carapace as we can find His success had translated to an easier time for Bridge Four Kaladin had pled that his men needed time to find carapace and Hashalnot knowing any betterhad reduced the scavenging quota She was already pretendingquite smoothlythat the armor had been her idea the entire time and was ignoring the question of where it had come from in the first place When she met Kaladins eyes however he saw worry What else would he try So far she hadnt dared remove him Not while he brought her so much praise from Sadeas How did an apprentice armorer end up as a bridgeman anyway Kaladin asked as Leyten settled back down to work He was a thickarmed man stout and ovalfaced with light hair Craftsmen dont usually get thrown away Leyten shrugged When a piece of armor breaks and a lighteyes takes an arrow in the shoulder someone has to take the blame Im convinced my master keeps an extra apprentice especially for those kinds of situation Well his loss is our good fortune Youre going to keep us alive Ill do my best sir He smiled Cant do much worse on the armor than you did yourself though Its amazing that breastplate didnt fall off halfway through Kaladin patted the bridgeman on the shoulder then left him to his work surrounded by a small ring of topaz chips Kaladin had gotten permission to bring them explaining his men needed light to work on the armor Nearby Lopen Rock and Dabbid were returning with another load of salvage Syl zipped ahead leading them Kaladin walked down the chasm a garnet sphere looped in a small leather carrier at his belt for light The chasm branched here making a large triangular intersectiona perfect place for spear training Wide enough to give the men room to practice yet far enough from any permanent bridges that scouts werent likely to hear echoes Kaladin gave the initial instructions each day then let Teft lead the practice The men worked by sphere light small piles of diamond chips at the corners of the intersection barely enough to see by Never thought Id envy those days practicing beneath the hot sun back in Amarams army he thought He walked up to gaptoothed Hobber and corrected his stance then showed him how to set his weight behind his spear thrusts The bridgemen were progressing quickly and the fundamentals were proving their merit Some were training with the spear and the shield practicing stances where they held lighter spears up beside the head with the shield raised The most skilled were Skar and Moash In fact Moash was surprisingly good Kaladin walked to the side watching the hawkfaced man He was focused eyes intense jaw set He moved in attack after attack the dozen spheres giving him an equal number of shadows Kaladin remembered feeling such dedication Hed spent a year like that after Tiens death driving himself to exhaustion each day Determined to get better Determined never to let another person die because of his lack of skill Hed become the best in his squad then the best in his company Some said hed been the best spearmen in Amarams army What would have happened to him if Tarah hadnt coaxed him out of his singleminded dedication Would he have burned himself out as shed claimed Moash Kaladin called Moash paused turning toward Kaladin He didnt fall out of stance Kaladin waved him to approach and Moash reluctantly trotted over Lopen had left a few waterskins for them hanging by their cords from a cluster of haspers Kaladin pulled a skin free tossing it to Moash The other man took a drink then wiped his mouth Youre getting good Kaladin said Youre probably the best we have Thanks Moash said Ive noticed you keep training when Teft lets the other men take breaks Dedication is good but dont work yourself ragged I want you to be one of the decoys Moash smiled broadly Each of the men had volunteered to be one of the four who would join Kaladin distracting the Parshendi It was amazing Months ago Moashalong with the othershad eagerly placed the new or the weak at the front of the bridge to catch arrows Now to a man they volunteered for the most dangerous jobs Do you realize what you could have in these men Sadeas Kaladin thought If you werent so busy thinking of how to get them killed So what is it for you Kaladin said nodding toward the dim practice ground Why do you work so hard What is it you hunt Vengeance the other man said face somber Kaladin nodded I lost someone once Because I wasnt good enough with the spear I nearly killed myself practicing Who was it My brother Moash nodded The other bridgemen Moash included seemed to regard Kaladins mysterious past with reverence Im glad I trained Kaladin said And Im glad youre dedicated But you have to be careful If Id gotten myself killed by working so hard it wouldnt have meant anything Sure But theres a difference between us Kaladin Kaladin raised an eyebrow You wanted to be able to save someone Me I want to kill somebody Who Moash hesitated then shook his head Maybe Ill say someday He reached out grabbing Kaladin on the shoulder Id surrendered my plans but youve returned them to me Ill guard you with my life Kaladin I swear it to you by the blood of my fathers Kaladin met Moashs intense eyes and nodded All right then Go help Hobber and Yake Theyre still off on their thrusts Moash jogged off to do as told He didnt call Kaladin sir and didnt seem to regard him with the same unspoken reverence as the others That made Kaladin more comfortable with him Kaladin spent the next hour helping the men one by one Most of them were overeager throwing themselves into their attacks Kaladin explained the importance of control and precision which won more fights than chaotic enthusiasm They took it in listening More and more they reminded him of his old spear squad That set him thinking He remembered how he had felt when originally proposing the escape plan to the men Hed been looking for something to doa way to fight no matter how risky A chance Things had changed He now had a team he was proud of friends he had come to love and a possibilityperhapsfor stability If they could get the dodging and armor right they might be reasonably safe Maybe even as safe as his old spear squad had been Was running still the best option That is a worried face a rumbling voice noted Kaladin turned as Rock walked up and leaned against the wall near him folding powerful forearms Is the face of a leader say I Always troubled Rock raised a bushy red eyebrow Sadeas will never let us go particularly not now that were so prominent Alethi lighteyes considered it reprehensible for a man to let slaves escape it made him seem impotent Capturing those who ran away was essential to save face You said this thing before Rock said We will fight the men he sends after us will seek Kharbranth where there are no slaves From there the Peaks to my people who will welcome us as heroes We might beat the first group if hes foolish and sends only a few dozen men But after that hell send more And what of our wounded Do we leave them here to die Or do we take them with us and go that much more slowly Rock nodded slowly You are saying that we need a plan Yes Kaladin said I guess thats what Im saying Either that or we stay here as bridgemen Ha Rock seemed to take it as a joke Despite new armor we would die soon We make ourselves targets Kaladin hesitated Rock was right The bridgemen would be used day in and day out Even if Kaladin slowed the death toll to two or three men a monthonce he would have considered that impossible but now it seemed within reachBridge Four as it was currently composed would be gone within a year I will talk with Sigzil about this thing Rock said rubbing his chin between the sides of his beard We will think There must be a way to escape this trap a way to disappear A false trail A distraction Perhaps we can convince Sadeas that we have died during bridge run How would we do that Dont know Rock said But we will think He nodded to Kaladin and sauntered off toward Sigzil The Azish man was practicing with the others Kaladin had tried speaking to him about Hoid but Sigziltypically closemouthedhadnt wanted to discuss it Hey Kaladin Skar called He was part of an advanced group that was going through Tefts very carefully supervised sparring Come spar with us Show these rockbrained fools how its really done The others began calling for him as well Kaladin waved them down shaking his head Teft trotted over a heavy spear on one shoulder Lad he said quietly I think it would be good for their morale if you showed them a thing or two yourself Ive already given them instruction With a spear you knocked the head off of Going very slowly with lots of talk They need to see it lad See you Weve been through this Teft Well so we have Kaladin smiled Teft was careful not to look angry or belligerenthe looked as if he were having a normal conversation with Kaladin Youve been a sergeant before havent you Never mind that Come on just show them a few simple routines No Teft Kaladin said more seriously Teft eyed him You going to refuse to fight on the battlefield just like that Horneater Its not like that Well what is it like Kaladin reached for an explanation Ill fight when the time comes But if I let myself get back into it now Ill be too eager Ill push to attack now Ill have trouble waiting until the men are ready Trust me Teft Teft studied him Youre scared of it lad What No I I can see it Teft said And Ive seen it before Last time you fought for someone you failed eh So now you hesitate to take it up again Kaladin paused Yes he admitted But it was more than that When he fought again he would have to become that man from long ago the man who had been called Stormblessed The man with confidence and strength He wasnt certain he could be that man any longer That was what scared him Once he held that spear again there would be no turning back Well Teft rubbed his chin When the time comes I hope youre ready Because this lot will need you Kaladin nodded and Teft hurried back to the others giving some kind of explanation to mollify them Map of the Battle of the Tower drawn and labeled by Navani Kholin circa 1173 They come from the pit two dead men a heart in their hands and I know that I have seen true glory Kakashah 1173 13 seconds predeath A rickshaw puller I couldnt decide if you were interested or not Navani said softly to Dalinar as they slowly walked around the grounds of Elhokars raised field palace Half the time you seemed like a flirtoffering hints at courtship then backing away The other half of the time I was certain I had misread you And Gavilar was so forthcoming He always did prefer to seize what he wished Dalinar nodded thoughtfully He wore his blue uniform while Navani was in a subdued maroon dress with a thick hem Elhokars gardeners had begun to cultivate the plant life here To their right a twisting length of yellow shalebark rose to waist height like a railing The stonelike plant was overgrown by small bunches of haspers with pearly shells slowly opening and closing as they breathed They looked like tiny mouths silently speaking in rhythm with one another Dalinar and Navanis pathway took a leisurely course up the hillside Dalinar strolled with hands clasped behind his back His honor guard and Navanis clerks followed behind A few of them looked perplexed at the amount of time Dalinar and Navani were spending with one another How many of them suspected the truth All Part None Did it matter I didnt mean to confuse you all those years ago he said voice soft to keep it from prying ears I had intended to court you but Gavilar expressed a preference for you So I eventually felt I had to step aside Just like that Navani asked She sounded offended He didnt realize that I was interested He thought that by introducing you to him I was indicating that he should court you That was often how our relationship worked I would discover people Gavilar should know then bring them to him I didnt realize until too late what I had done in giving you to him Giving me Is there a slaves brand on my forehead of which Ive been unaware I did not mean Oh hush Navani said her voice suddenly fond Dalinar stifled a sigh though Navani had matured since their youth her moods always had changed as quickly as the seasons In truth that was part of her allure Did you often step aside for him Navani asked Always Didnt that grow tiresome I didnt think about it much Dalinar said When I did yes I was frustrated But it was Gavilar You know how he was That force of will that air of natural entitlement It always seemed to surprise him when someone denied him or when the world itself didnt do as he wished He didnt force me to deferit was simply how life was Navani nodded in understanding Regardless Dalinar said I apologize for confusing you I well I had difficulty letting go I fear thaton occasionI let too much of my true feelings slip out Well I suppose I can forgive that she said Though you did spend the next two de cades making certain I thought you hated me I did nothing of the sort Oh And how else was I to interpret your coldness The way you would often leave the room when I arrived Containing myself Dalinar said I had made my decision Well it looked a lot like hatred Navani said Though I did wonder several times what you were hiding behind those stony eyes of yours Of course then Shshshsh came along As always when the name of his wife was spoken it came to him as the sound of softly rushing air then slipped from his mind immediately He could not hear or remember the name She changed everything Navani said You truly seemed to love her I did Dalinar said Surely he had loved her Hadnt he He could remember nothing What was she like He quickly added I mean in your opinion How did you see her Everyone loved Shshshsh Navani said I tried hard to hate her but in the end I could only be mildly jealous You Jealous of her Whatever for Because Navani said She fit you so well never making inappropriate comments never bullying those around her always so calm Navani smiled Thinking back I really should have been able to hate her But she was just so nice Though she wasnt very well What Dalinar asked Clever Navani said She blushed which was rare for her Im sorry Dalinar but she just wasnt She wasnt a fool but well not everyone can be cunning Perhaps that was part of her charm She seemed to think that Dalinar would be offended Its all right he said Were you surprised that I married her Who could be surprised As I said she was perfect for you Because we were matched intellectually Dalinar said dryly Hardly But you were matched in temperament For a time after I got over trying to hate her I thought that the four of us could be quite close But you were so stiff toward me I could not allow any further lapses to make you think that I was still interested He said the last part awkwardly After all wasnt that what he was doing now Lapsing Navani eyed him There you go again What Feeling guilty Dalinar you are a wonderful honorable manbut you really are quite prone to selfindulgence Guilt As selfindulgence I never considered it that way before She smiled deeply What he asked You really are genuine arent you Dalinar I try to be he said He glanced over his shoulder Though the nature of our relationship continues to perpetuate a kind of lie Weve lied to nobody Let them think or guess what they wish I suppose you are right I usually am She fell silent for a moment Do you regret what we have No Dalinar said sharply the strength of his objection surprising him Navani just smiled No Dalinar continued more gently I do not regret this Navani I dont know how to proceed but I am not going to let go Navani hesitated beside a growth of tiny fistsize rockbuds with their vines out like long green tongues They were grouped almost like a bouquet growing on a large oval stone placed beside the pathway I suppose its too much to ask for you to not feel guilty Navani said Cant you let yourself bend just a little Im not certain if I can Particularly not now Explaining why would be difficult Could you try to For me I Well Im a man of extremes Navani I discovered that when I was a youth Ive learned repeatedly that the only way to control those extremes is to dedicate my life to something First it was Gavilar Now its the Codes and the teachings of Nohadon Theyre the means by which I bind myself Like the enclosure of a fire meant to contain and control it He took a deep breath Im a weak man Navani I really am If I give myself a few feet of leeway I burst through all of my prohibitions The momentum of following the Codes these years after Gavilars death is what keeps me strong If I let a few cracks into that armor I might return to the man I once was A man I never want to be again A man who had contemplated murdering his own brother for the throneand for the woman who had married that brother But he couldnt explain that didnt dare let Navani know what his desire for her had once almost driven him to do On that day Dalinar had sworn that he would never hold the throne himself That was one of his restraints Could he explain how she without trying pried at those restraints How it was difficult to reconcile his longfermenting love for her with his guilt at finally taking for himself what hed long ago given up for his brother You are not a weak man Dalinar Navani said I am But weakness can imitate strength if bound properly just as cowardice can imitate heroism if given nowhere to flee But theres nothing in Gavilars book that prohibits us Its just tradition that It feels wrong Dalinar said But please dont worry I do enough worrying for both of us I will find a way to make this work I just ask your understanding It will take time When I display frustration it is not with you but with the situation I suppose I can accept that Assuming you can live with the rumors Theyre starting already They wont be the first rumors to plague me he said Im starting to worry less about them and more about Elhokar How will we explain to him I doubt hell notice Navani said snorting softly resuming her walk He followed Hes so fixated on the Parshendi and occasionally the idea that someone in camp is trying to kill him This might feed into that Dalinar said He could read a number of conspiracies out of the two of us entering a relationship Well he Horns began sounding loudly from below Dalinar and Navani stopped to listen and identify the call Stormfather Dalinar said Thats the Tower itself where a chasmfiend has been seen Its one of the plateaus Sadeas has been watching Dalinar felt a surge of excitement Highprinces have failed every time to win a gemheart there It will be a major victory if he and I can do it together Navani looked troubled Youre right about him Dalinar We do need him for our cause But keep him at arms length Wish me the winds favor He reached toward her but then stopped himself What was he going to do Embrace her here in public That would set off the rumors like fire across a pool of oil He wasnt ready for that yet Instead he bowed to her then hastened off to answer the call and collect his Shardplate It wasnt until he was halfway down the path that he paused to consider Navanis choice of words She had said We need him for our cause What was their cause He doubted that Navani knew either But she had already started to think of them as together in their eff orts And he realized so did he The horns called such a pure and beautiful sound to signify the imminence of battle It caused a frenzy in the lumberyard The orders had come down The Tower was to be assaulted againthe very place where Bridge Four had failed the place where Kaladin had caused a disaster Largest of the plateaus Most coveted Bridgemen ran this way and that for their vests Carpenters and apprentices rushed out of the way Matal shouted orders an actual run was the only time he did that without Hashal Bridgeleaders showing a modicum of leadership bellowed for their teams to line up A wind whipped the air blowing wood chips and bits of dried grass into the sky Men yelled bells rang And into this chaos strode Bridge Four Kaladin at their head Despite the urgency soldiers stopped bridgemen gaped carpenters and apprentices stilled Thirtyfive men marched in rusty orange carapace armor expertly crafted by Leyten to fit onto leather jerkins and caps Theyd cut off arm guards and shin guards to complement the breastplates The helms were built from several different headpieces and had been ornamentedat Leytens insistencewith ridges and cuts like tiny horns or the edges of a crabs shell The breastplates and guards were ornamented as well cut into toothlike patterns each one reminiscent of a saw blade Earless Jaks had bought blue and white paint and drawn designs across the orange armor Each member of Bridge Four carried a large wooden shield strapped tightly nowwith red Parshendi bones Ribs for the most part shaped in spiral patterns Some of the men had tied finger bones to the centers so they would rattle and others had attached protruding sharp ribs to the sides of their helms giving them the look of fangs or mandibles The onlookers watched with amazement It wasnt the first time theyd seen this armor but this would be the first run where every man of Bridge Four had it All together it made an impressive sight Ten days with six bridge runs had allowed Kaladin and his team to perfect their method Five men to be decoys with five more in the front holding shields and using only one arm to support the bridge Their numbers were augmented by the wounded theyd saved from other crews now strong enough to help carry So fardespite six bridge runsthere hadnt been a single fatality The other bridgemen were whispering about a miracle Kaladin didnt know about that He just made certain to keep a full pouch of infused spheres with him at all times Most of the Parshendi archers seemed to focus on him Somehow they could tell that he was the center of all this They reached their bridge and formed up shields strapped to rods on the sides to await use As they hefted their bridge a spontaneous round of cheering rose up from the other crews Thats new Teft said from Kaladins left Guess they finally realized what we are Kaladin said And whats that Kaladin settled the bridge onto his shoulders Were their champions Bridge forward They broke into a trot leading the way down from the staging yard ushered by cheers My father is not insane Adolin thought alive with energy and excitement as his armorers strapped on his Shardplate Adolin had stewed over Navanis revelation for days Hed been wrong in such a horrible way Dalinar Kholin wasnt growing weak He wasnt getting senile He wasnt a coward Dalinar had been right and Adolin had been wrong After much soul searching Adolin had come to a decision He was glad that hed been wrong He grinned flexing the fingers of his Plated hand as the armorers moved to his other side He didnt know what the visions meant or what the implications of those visions would be His father was some kind of prophet and that was daunting to consider But for now it was enough that Dalinar was not insane It was time to trust him Stormfather knew Dalinar had earned that right from his sons The armorers finished with Adolins Shardplate As they stepped away Adolin hurried out of the armoring room into the sunlight adjusting to the combined strength speed and weight of the Shardplate Niter and five other members of the Cobalt Guard hastened up one bringing Sureblood to him Adolin took the reins but led the Ryshadium at first wanting more time to adapt to his Plate They soon entered the staging area Dalinars father in his Shardplate was conferring with Teleb and Ilamar He seemed to tower over them as he pointed eastward Already companies of soldiers were moving out onto the lip of the Plains Adolin strode up to his father eager In the near distance he noticed a figure riding down along the eastern rim of the warcamps The figure wore gleaming red Shardplate Father Adolin said pointing Whats he doing here Shouldnt he be waiting for us to ride to his camp Dalinar looked up He waved for a groom to bring Gallant and the two of them mounted They rode down to intercept Sadeas trailed by a dozen members of the Cobalt Guard Did Sadeas want to call off the assault Was he worried about failing against the Tower again Once they drew close Dalinar pulled up You should be moving Sadeas Speed will be important if were to get to the plateau before the Parshendi take the gemheart and go The highprince nodded Agreed in part But we need to confer first Dalinar this is the Tower were assaulting He seemed eager Yes and Damnation man Sadeas said Youre the one who told me we needed to find a way to trap a large force of Parshendi on a plateau The Tower is perfect They always bring a large force there and two sides are inaccessible Adolin found himself nodding Yes he said Father hes right If we can box them in and hit them hard The Parshendi normally fled when they took large losses That was one of the things extending the war so long It could mean a turning point in the war Sadeas said eyes alight My scribes estimate that they have no more than twenty or thirty thousand troops left The Parshendi will commit ten thousand herethey always do But if we can corner and kill all of them we could nearly destroy their ability to wage war on these Plains Itll work Father Adolin said eagerly This could be what weve been waiting forwhat youve been waiting for A way to turn the war a way to deal enough damage to the Parshendi that they cant afford to keep fighting We need troops Dalinar Sadeas said Lots of them How many men could you field at maximum On short notice Dalinar said Eight thousand perhaps It will have to do Sadeas said Ive managed to mobilize about seven thousand Well bring them all Get your eight thousand to my camp and well take every one of my bridge crews and march together The Parshendi will get there firstits inevitable with a plateau that close to their sidebut if we can be fast enough we can corner them on the plateau Then well show them what a real Alethi army is capable of I wont risk lives on your bridges Sadeas Dalinar said I dont know that I can agree to a completely joint assault Bah Sadeas said Ive got a new way of using bridgemen one that doesnt use nearly as many lives Their casualties have dropped to almost nothing Really Dalinar said Is it because of those bridgemen with armor What made you change Sadeas shrugged Perhaps youre getting through to me Regardless we need to go now Together With as many troops as theyll have I cant risk engaging them and waiting for you to catch up I want to go together and assault as closely together as we can manage If youre still worried about the bridgemen I can attack first and gain a foothold then let you cross without risking bridgeman lives Dalinar looked thoughtful Come on Father Adolin thought Youve been waiting for a chance to hit the Parshendi hard This is it Very well Dalinar said Adolin send messengers to mobilize the Fourth through Eighth Divisions Prepare the men to march Lets end this war I see them They are the rocks They are the vengeful spirits Eyes of red Kakakes 1173 8 seconds predeath A darkeyed young woman of fifteen Subject was reportedly mentally unstable since childhood Several hours later Dalinar stood with Sadeas on a rock formation overlooking the Tower itself It had been a hard long march This was a distant plateau as far eastward as they had ever struck Plateaus beyond this point were impossible to take The Parshendi could arrive so quickly that they had the gemheart out before the Alethi arrived Sometimes that happened with the Tower as well Dalinar searched I see it he said pointing They dont have the gemheart out yet A ring of Parshendi were pounding on the chrysalis Its shell was like thick stone however It was still holding You should be glad youre using my bridges old friend Sadeas shaded his face with a gauntleted hand Those chasms might be too wide for a Shardbearer to jump Dalinar nodded The Tower was enormous even its huge size on the maps didnt do it justice Unlike other plateaus it wasnt levelinstead it was shaped like an enormous wedge that dipped toward the west pointing a large cliff face in the stormward direction It was too steepand the chasms too wideto approach from the east or south Only three adjacent plateaus could provide staging areas for assaults all along the western or northwestern side The chasms between these plateaus were unusually large almost too wide for the bridges to span On the nearby staging plateaus thousands upon thousands of soldiers in blue or red were gathered one color per plateau Combined they made for a larger force than Dalinar had ever seen brought against the Parshendi The Parshendi numbers were as large as anticipated There were at least ten thousand of them lining up This would be a fullscale battle the kind Dalinar had been hoping for the kind that would let them pit a huge number of Alethi against a large Parshendi force This could be it The turning point in the war Win this day and everything would change Dalinar shaded his eyes as well helm under his arm He noted with satisfaction that Sadeass scouting crews were crossing to adjacent plateaus where they could watch for Parshendi reinforcements Just because the Parshendi had brought so many at first didnt mean that there were no other Parshendi forces waiting to flank them Dalinar and Sadeas wouldnt be taken by surprise again Come with me Sadeas said Let us assault them together A single grand wave of attack across forty bridges Dalinar looked down at the bridge crews many of their members were lying exhausted on the plateau Awaitinglikely dreadingtheir next task Very few of them wore the armor Sadeas had spoken of Hundreds of them would be slaughtered in the assault if they attacked together But was that any different from what Dalinar did asking his men to charge into battle to seize the plateau Werent they all part of the same army The cracks He couldnt let them get wider If he was going to be with Navani he had to prove to himself he could remain firm in the other areas No he said I will attack but only after youve made a landing point for my bridge crews Even that is more than I should allow Never force your men to do as you yourself would not You do charge the Parshendi Id never do it carrying one of those bridges Dalinar said Im sorry old friend Its not a judgment of you It is what I must do Sadeas shook his head pulling on his helmet Well it will have to do We still planning on dining together tonight to discuss strategy I assume so Unless Elhokar has a fit for both of us missing his feast Sadeas snorted Hes going to have to grow accustomed to it Six years of feasting every night is growing tedious Besides I doubt hell feel anything but elation after we win this day and leave the Parshendi down a full third of their soldiers See you on the battlefield Dalinar nodded and Sadeas jumped off the rock formation dropping down to the surface below and joining his officers Dalinar lingered looking over at the Tower It was not only larger than most plateaus it was rougher covered with lumpish rock formations of hardened crem The patterns were rolling and smooth yet very unevenlike a field full of short walls covered by a blanket of snow The southeastern tip of the plateau rose to a point overlooking the Plains The two plateaus theyd use were on the middle of the west side Sadeas would take the northern one and Dalinar would assault from one just below it once Sadeas had cleared a landing for him We need to push the Parshendi to the southeast Dalinar thought rubbing his chin corner them there Everything hinged on that The chrysalis was up near the top so the Parshendi were already situated in a good position for Dalinar and Sadeas to push them back against the cliff edge The Parshendi would probably allow this as it would give them the high ground If a second Parshendi army came it would be separated from the others The Alethi could focus on the Parshendi trapped atop the Tower while holding a defensive formation against the new arrivals It would work He felt himself growing excited He hopped down to a shorter outcropping then walked down a few steplike clefts to reach the plateau floor where his officers waited He then rounded the rock formation investigating Adolins progress The young man stood in his Shardplate directing the companies as they crossed Sadeass mobile bridges onto the southern staging plateau In the near distance Sadeass men were forming up for the assault That group of armored bridgemen stood out preparing at the front center of the formation of bridge crews Why were they allowed armor Why not the others as well It looked like Parshendi carapace Dalinar shook his head The assault began bridge crews running out ahead of Sadeass army approaching the Tower first Where would you like to make our assault Father Adolin asked summoning his Shardblade and resting it on his pauldron sharp side up There Dalinar said pointing to a spot on their staging plateau Get the men ready Adolin nodded shouting the orders In the distance bridgemen began to die Heralds guide your paths you poor men Dalinar thought As well as my own Kaladin danced with the wind Arrows streamed around him passing close nearly kissing him with their painted scragglebark fletching He had to let them get close had to make the Parshendi feel they were near to killing him Despite four other bridgemen drawing their attention despite the other men of Bridge Four behind armored with the skeletons of fallen Parshendi most of the archers focused on Kaladin He was a symbol A living banner to destroy Kaladin spun between arrows slapping them away with his shield A storm raged inside him as if his blood had been sucked away and replaced with stormwinds It made his fingertips tingle with energy Ahead the Parshendi sang their angry chanting song The song for one who blasphemed against their dead Kaladin stayed at the front of the decoys letting the arrows fall close Daring them Taunting them Demanding they kill him until the arrows stopped falling and the wind stilled Kaladin came to rest breath held to contain the storm within The Parshendi reluctantly fell back before Sadeass force An enormous force as far as plateau assaults went Thousands of men and thirtytwo bridges Despite Kaladins distraction five bridges had been dropped the men carrying them slaughtered None of the soldiers rushing across the chasm had made any specific eff ort to attack the archers firing on Kaladin but the weight of numbers had forced them away A few gave Kaladin loathing gazes making an odd gesture by cupping a hand to the right ear and pointing at him before finally retreating Kaladin released his breath Stormlight pulsing away from him He had to walk a very fine line drawing in enough Stormlight to stay alive but not so much that it was visible to the watching soldiers The Tower rose ahead of him a slab of stone that dipped toward the west The chasm was so wide that hed worried the men would drop the bridge into the chasm as they tried to place it On the other side Sadeas had arrayed his forces in a cupping shape pushing the Parshendi back away trying to give Dalinar an opening Perhaps attacking this way served to protect Dalinars pristine image He wouldnt make bridgemen die Not directly at least Never mind that he stood on the backs of the men who had fallen to get Sadeas across Their corpses were his true bridge Kaladin a voice called from behind Kaladin spun One of his men was wounded Storm it he thought dashing up to Bridge Four There was enough Stormlight still pulsing in his veins to stave off exhaustion Hed grown complacent Six bridge runs without a casualty He should have realized it couldnt last He pushed through the collected bridgemen to find Skar on the ground holding his foot red blood seeping between his fingers Arrow in the foot Skar said through gritted teeth In the storming foot Who gets hit in the foot Kaladin Moashs voice said urgent The bridgemen split as Moash brought Teft in an arrow sprouting from his shoulder between carapace breastplate and arm Storm it Kaladin said helping Moash set Teft down The older bridgeman looked dazed The arrow had dug deep into the muscle Somebody get pressure on Skars foot and wrap it until I can look at it Teft can you hear me Im sorry lad Teft mumbled eyes glassy Im Youre all right Kaladin said hurriedly taking some bandages from Lopen then nodding grimly Lopen would heat a knife for cauterizing Who else Everyone else is accounted for Drehy said Teft was trying to hide his wound He must have taken it when we were shoving the bridge across Kaladin pressed gauze against the wound then gestured for Lopen to hurry with the heated knife I want our scouts watching Make sure the Parshendi dont try a stunt like they did a few weeks back If they jump across that plateau to get at Bridge Four were dead Is all right Rock said shading his eyes Sadeas is keeping his men in this area No Parshendi will get through The knife came and Kaladin held it hesitantly a curl of smoke rising from its length Teft had lost too much blood there was no risking a sewing But with the twist of the knife Kaladin risked some bad scarring That could leave the aging bridgeman with a stiff ness that would hurt his ability to wield a spear Reluctantly Kaladin pressed the knife into the wound the flesh hissing and blood drying to black crisps Painspren wiggled out of the ground sinewy and orange In a surgery you could sew But on the field this was often the only way Im sorry Teft He shook his head as he continued to work Men began to scream Arrows hit wood and flesh sounding like distant woodsmen swinging axes Dalinar waited beside his men watching Sadeass soldiers fight He had better give us an opening he thought Im starting to hunger for this plateau Fortunately Sadeas quickly gained his footing on the Tower and sent a flanking force over to carve out a section of land for Dalinar They didnt get entirely into place before Dalinar started moving One of you bridges come with me he bellowed barreling to the forefront He was followed by one of the eight bridge teams Sadeas had lent him Dalinar needed to get onto that plateau The Parshendi had noticed what was happening and had begun to put pressure on the small company in green and white that Sadeas had sent to defend his entry area Bridge crew there Dalinar said pointing The bridgemen hustled into place looking relieved that they wouldnt be asked to place their bridge under fire of arrows As soon as they got it into position Dalinar charged across the Cobalt Guard following Just ahead Sadeass men broke Dalinar bellowed closing his gauntleted hands around Oathbringers hilt as the sword formed from mist He crashed into the surging Parshendi line with a wide twohanded sweep that dropped four men The Parshendi began to chant in their strange language singing their war song Dalinar kicked a corpse aside and began to attack in earnest frantically defending the foothold Sadeass men had gained him Within minutes his soldiers surged around him With the Cobalt Guard watching his back Dalinar waded into the battle breaking enemy ranks as only a Shardbearer could He tore pockets through the Parshendi front lines like a fish leaping from a stream cutting back and forth keeping his enemies disorganized Corpses with burned eyes and slashed clothing made a trail behind him More and more Alethi troops filled in the holes Adolin crashed through a group of Parshendi nearby his own squad of Cobalt Guardsmen a safe distance behind He brought his whole army acrosshe needed to ascend quickly pinning the Parshendi back so they couldnt escape Sadeas was to watch the northern and western edges of the Tower The rhythm of the battle sang to Dalinar The Parshendi chanting the soldiers grunting and yelling the Shardblade in his hands and the surging power of the Plate The Thrill rose within him Since the nausea didnt strike him he carefully let the Blackthorn free and felt the joy of dominating a battlefield and the disappointment at lacking a worthy foe Where were the Parshendi Shardbearers He had seen that one in battle weeks ago Why had he not reappeared Would they commit so many men to the Tower without sending a Shardbearer Something heavy hit his armor banging off it causing a small puff of Stormlight to escape between the joints along his upper arm Dalinar cursed raising an arm to protect his face while scanning the near distance There he thought picking out a nearby rock formation where a group of Parshendi stood swinging enormous rock slings with two hands The headsize stones crashed into Parshendi and Alethi alike though Dalinar was obviously the target He growled as another one hit smashing against his forearm sending a soft jolt through the Shardplate The blow was strong enough to send a small array of cracks through his right vambrace Dalinar growled and threw himself into a Plateenhanced run The Thrill surged more strongly through him and he rammed his shoulder into a group of Parshendi scattering them then spun with his Blade and cut down those too slow to get out of his way He dodged to the side as a hail of stones fell where hed been standing then leaped onto a low boulder He took two steps and jumped for the ledge where the rockthrowers were standing He grabbed its edge with one hand holding his Blade with the other The men atop the small ridge stumbled back but Dalinar heaved himself up just high enough to swing Oathbringer cut at their legs and four men tumbled to the ground feet dead Dalinar dropped the Bladeit vanishedand used both hands to heave himself onto the ridge He landed in a crouch Plate clanking Several of the remaining Parshendi tried to swing their slings but Dalinar grabbed a pair of headsize stones from a pileeasily palming them in his gauntleted handsand flung them at the Parshendi The stones hit with enough force to toss the slingmen off the formation crushing their chests Dalinar smiled then began throwing more stones As the last Parshendi fell off the ledge Dalinar spun summoning Oathbringer and looking over the battlefield A spear wall of blue and reflective steel struggled against black and red Parshendi Dalinars men did well pressing the Parshendi up to the southeast where they would be trapped Adolin led this eff ort Shardplate gleaming Breathing deeply from the Thrill now Dalinar held his Shardblade up above his head reflecting sunlight Below his men cheered sending up calls that rose above the Parshendi war chant Gloryspren sprouted around him Stormfather but it felt good to be winning again He threw himself off the rock formation for once not taking the slow and careful way down He fell amid a group of Parshendi crashing to the stones blue Stormlight rising from his armor He spun slaying remembering years spent fighting alongside Gavilar Winning conquering He and Gavilar had created something during those years A solidified cohesive nation out of something fractured Like master potters reconstructing a fine ceramic that had been dropped With a roar Dalinar cut through the line of Parshendi to where the Cobalt Guard was fighting to catch up to him We press them he bellowed Pass the word All companies up the side of the Tower Soldiers raised spears and runners went to deliver his orders Dalinar spun and charged into the Parshendi pushing himselfand his army forward To the north Sadeass forces were stalled Well Dalinars force would do the work for him If Dalinar could spear forward here he could slice the Parshendi in half then crush the northern side against Sadeas and the southern side against the cliff edge His army surged forward behind him and the Thrill bubbled within It was power Strength greater than Shardplate Vitality greater than youth Skill greater than a lifetime of practice A fever of power Parshendi after Parshendi fell before his Blade He couldnt cut their flesh yet he sheared through their ranks The momentum of their attacks often carried their corpses stumbling past him even as their eyes burned The Parshendi started to break running away or falling back He grinned behind his neartranslucent visor This was life This was control Gavilar had been the leader the momentum and the essence of their conquest But Dalinar had been the warrior Their opponents had surrendered to Gavilars rule but the Blackthornhe was the man who had scattered them the one who had dueled their leaders and slain their best Shardbearers Dalinar screamed at the Parshendi and their entire line bent then shattered The Alethi surged forward cheering Dalinar joined his men charging at their forefront to run down the fleeing Parshendi warpairs as they fled to the north or south trying to join larger groups who held there He reached a pair One turned to hold him off with a hammer but Dalinar cut him down in passing then grabbed the other Parshendi and threw him down with a twist of the arm Grinning Dalinar raised his Blade high over his head looming over the soldier The Parshendi rolled awkwardly holding his arm no doubt shattered as he was thrown down He looked up at Dalinar terrified fearspren appearing around him He was only a youth Dalinar froze Blade held above his head muscles taut Those eyes that face Parshendi might not be human but their featurestheir expressionswere the same Save for the marbled skin and the strange growths of carapace armor this boy could have been a groom in Dalinars stable What did he see above him A faceless monster in impervious armor What was this youths story He would only have been a boy when Gavilar had been assassinated Dalinar stumbled backward the Thrill vanishing One of the Cobalt Guardsmen passed by casually ramming a sword into the Parshendi boys neck Dalinar raised a hand but it was over too quickly for him to stop The soldier didnt notice Dalinars gesture Dalinar lowered his hand His men were rushing around him rolling over the fleeing Parshendi The majority of the Parshendi still fought resisting Sadeas on one side and Dalinars force on the other The eastern plateau edge was just a short distance to Dalinars righthe had come up against the Parshendi force like a spear slicing it through the center splitting it off to the north and south Around him lay the dead Many of them had fallen facedown taken in the back by spears or arrows from Dalinars forces Some Parshendi were still alive though dying They hummed or whispered to themselves a strange haunting song The one they sang as they waited to die Their whispered songs rose like the curses of spirits on Souls March Dalinar had always found the death song the most beautiful of all he had heard from the Parshendi It seemed to cut through the grunts clangs and screams of the nearby battle As always each Parshendis song was in perfect time with that of his fellows It was as if they could all hear the same melody somewhere far away singing along through sputtering bloodied lips with rasping breath The Codes Dalinar thought turning toward his fighting men Never ask of your men a sacrifice you wouldnt make yourself Never make them fight in conditions you would refuse to fight in yourself Never ask a man to perform an act you wouldnt soil your own hands doing He felt sick This wasnt beautiful This wasnt glorious This wasnt strength power or life This was revolting repellent and ghastly But they killed Gavilar he thought searching for a way to overcome the sickness he suddenly felt Unite them Roshar had been united once Had that included the Parshendi You dont know if you can trust the visions or not he told himself his honor guard forming up behind him They could be from the Nightwatcher or the Voidbringers Or something else entirely In that moment the objections felt weak What had the visions wanted him to do Bring peace to Alethkar unite his people act with justice and honor Could he not judge the visions based on those results He raised his Shardblade to his shoulder walking solemnly among the fallen toward the northern line where the Parshendi were trapped between his men and Sadeass His sickness grew stronger What was happening to him Father Adolins shout was frantic Dalinar turned toward his son who was running to him The young mans Plate was sprayed with Parshendi blood but as always his Blade gleamed What do we do Adolin asked panting About what Dalinar asked Adolin turned pointing to the westtoward the plateau south of the one from which Dalinars army had begun their assault over an hour ago There leaping across the wide chasm was an enormous second army of Parshendi Dalinar slammed his visor up fresh air washing across his sweaty face He stepped forward Hed anticipated this possibility but someone should have given warning Where were the scouts What was He felt a chill Shaking he scrambled toward one of the smooth bulging formations of rock that were plentiful on the Tower Father Adolin said running after him Dalinar climbed seeking the top of the formation dropping his Shardblade He crested the rise and stood looking northward over his troops and the Parshendi Northward toward Sadeas Adolin climbed up beside him gauntleted hand slapping up his visor Oh no he whispered Sadeass army was retreating across the chasm to the northern staging plateau Half of it was across already The eight groups of bridgemen hed lent Dalinar had pulled back and were gone Sadeas was abandoning Dalinar and his troops leaving them surrounded on three sides by Parshendi alone on the Shattered Plains And he was taking all of his bridges with him That chanting that singing those rasping voices Kaktach 1173 16 seconds predeath A middleaged potter Reported seeing strange dreams during highstorms during the last two years Kaladin wearily unwrapped Skars wound to inspect his stitches and change the bandage The arrow had hit on the right side of the ankle deflecting off the knob of the fibula and scraping down through the muscles on the side of the foot You were very lucky Skar Kaladin said putting on the new bandage Youll walk on this again assuming you do not put weight on it until its healed Well have some of the men carry you back to camp Behind them the screaming pounding pulsing battle raged on The fighting was distant now focused on the eastern edge of the plateau To Kaladins right Teft drank as Lopen poured water into his mouth The older man scowled taking the waterskin from Lopen with his good hand Im not an invalid he snapped Hed gotten over his initial dizziness though he was weak Kaladin sat back feeling drained When Stormlight faded away it left him exhausted That should pass soon it had been over an hour since the initial assault He carried a few more infused spheres in his pouch he forced himself to resist the urge to suck in their Light He stood up meaning to gather some men to carry Moash and Teft toward the far side of the plateau just in case the battle went poorly and they had to retreat That wasnt likely the Alethi soldiers had been doing well the last time hed checked He scanned the battlefield again What he saw made him freeze Sadeas was retreating At first it seemed so impossible that Kaladin couldnt accept it Was Sadeas bringing his men around to attack in another direction But no the rear guard was already across the bridges and Sadeass banner was approaching Was the highprince wounded Drehy Leyten grab Skar Rock and Peet you take Teft Hustle to the western side of the plateau in preparation to flee The rest of you get into bridge positions The men only now noticing what was going on responded with anxiety Moash youre with me Kaladin said hastening toward their bridge Moash hurried up beside Kaladin Whats going on Sadeas is pulling out Kaladin said watching the tide of Sadeass men in green slide away from the Parshendi lines like wax melting Theres no reason to The battles barely begun and his forces were winning I can only think that Sadeas must have been wounded Why would they withdraw the entire army for that Moash said You dont think he is His banner still flies Kaladin said So hes probably not dead Unless they left it up to keep the men from panicking He and Moash reached the side of the bridge Behind the rest of the crew hastened to form a line Matal was on the other side of the chasm speaking with the commander of the rear guard After a quick exchange Matal crossed and began to run down the line of bridge crews calling for them to prepare to carry He glanced at Kaladins team but saw they were already ready and so hurried on To Kaladins right on the adjacent plateauthe one where Dalinar had launched his assaultthe eight lent bridge crews pulled away from the battlefield crossing over to Kaladins plateau A lighteyed officer Kaladin didnt recognize was giving them orders Beyond them farther to the southwest a new Parshendi force had arrived and was pouring onto the Tower Sadeas rode up to the chasm The paint on his Shardplate gleamed in the sun it didnt bear a single scratch In fact his entire honor guard was unharmed Though they had gone over to the Tower they had disengaged the enemy and come back Why And then Kaladin saw it Dalinar Kholins force fighting on the upper middle slope of the wedge was now surrounded This new Parshendi force was flooding into sections that Sadeas had held supposedly protecting Dalinars retreat Theyre abandoning him Kaladin said This was a trap A setup Sadeas is leaving Highprince Kholinand all of his soldiersto die Kaladin scrambled around the end of the bridge pushing through the soldiers who were coming off it Moash cursed and followed Kaladin wasnt certain why he elbowed his way up to the next bridge bridge tenwhere Sadeas was crossing Perhaps he needed to see for certain that Sadeas wasnt wounded Perhaps he was still stunned This was treachery on a grand scale terrible enough that it made Amarams betrayal of Kaladin seem almost trivial Sadeas trotted his horse across the bridge the wood clattering He was accompanied by two lighteyed men in regular armor and all three had their helms under their arms as if they were on parade The honor guard stopped Kaladin looking hostile He was still close enough to see that Sadeas was indeed completely unharmed He was also close enough to study Sadeass proud face as he turned his horse and looked back at the Tower The second Parshendi army swarmed Kholins army trapping them Even without that Kholin had no bridges He could not retreat I told you old friend Sadeas said voice soft but distinct overlapping the distant screams I said that honor of yours would get you killed someday He shook his head Then he turned his horse trotting it away from the battlefield Dalinar cut down a Parshendi warpair There was always another to replace it He set his jaw falling into Windstance and taking the defensive holding his little rise in the hillside and acting as a rock over which the oncoming Parshendi wave would have to break Sadeas had planned this retreat well His men hadnt been having trouble theyd been ordered to fight in a way that they could easily disengage And he had a full forty bridges to retreat across Together that made his abandonment of Dalinar happen quickly by the scale of battles Though Dalinar had immediately ordered his men to push forward hoping to catch Sadeas while the bridges were still set he hadnt been nearly quick enough Sadeass bridges were pulling away the entirety of his army now across Adolin fought nearby They were two tired men in Plate facing an entire army Their armor had accumulated a frightening number of cracks None were critical yet but they did leak precious Stormlight Wisps of it rose like the songs of dying Parshendi I warned you not to trust him Adolin bellowed as he fought cutting down a pair of Parshendi then taking a wave of arrows from a team of archers who had set up nearby The arrows sprayed against Adolins armor scratching the paint One caught in a crack widening it I told you Adolin continued to yell lowering his arm from his face and slicing into the next pair of Parshendi just before they landed their hammers on him I said he was an eel I know Dalinar yelled back We walked right into this Adolin continued shouting as if he hadnt heard Dalinar We let him take away our bridges We let him get us onto the plateau before the second wave of Parshendi arrived We let him control the scouts We even suggested the attack pattern that would leave us surrounded if he didnt support us I know Dalinars heart twisted inside of him Sadeas was carrying out a premeditated carefully planned and very thorough betrayal Sadeas hadnt been overwhelmed hadnt retreated for safetythough that was undoubtedly what he would claim when he got back to camp A disaster hed say Parshendi everywhere Attacking together had upset the balance andunfortunatelyhed been forced to pull out and leave his friend Oh perhaps some of Sadeass men would talk tell the truth and other highprinces would undoubtedly know what really happened But nobody would challenge Sadeas openly Not after such a decisive and powerful maneuver The people in the warcamps would go along with it The other highprinces were too displeased with Dalinar to raise a fuss The only one who might speak up was Elhokar and Sadeas had his ear It wrenched Dalinars heart Had it all been an act Could he really have misjudged Sadeas so completely What of the investigation clearing Dalinar What of their plans and reminiscences All lies I saved your life Sadeas Dalinar watched Sadeass banner retreat across the staging plateau Among that distant group a rider who wore crimson Shardplate turned and looked back Sadeas watching Dalinar fighting for his life That figure paused for a moment then turned around and rode on The Parshendi were surrounding the forward position where Dalinar and Adolin fought just ahead of the army They were overwhelming his guard He jumped down and slew another pair of enemies but earned another blow to his forearm in the process The Parshendi swarmed around him and Dalinars guard began to buckle Pull away he yelled at Adolin then began to back toward the army proper The youth cursed but did as ordered Dalinar and Adolin retreated back behind the front line of defense Dalinar pulled off his cracked helm panting Hed been fighting nonstop long enough to get winded despite his Shardplate He let one of the guardsmen hand him a waterskin and Adolin did the same Dalinar squirted the warm water into his mouth and across his face It had the metallic taste of stormwater Adolin lowered his waterskin swishing the water in his mouth He met Dalinars eyes his face haunted and grim He knew Just as Dalinar did Just as the men likely did There would be no surviving this battle The Parshendi left no survivors Dalinar braced himself waiting for further accusations from Adolin The boy had been right all along And whatever the visions were they had misled Dalinar in at least one respect Trusting Sadeas had brought them to doom Men died just a short distance away screaming and cursing Dalinar longed to fight but he needed to rest himself Losing a Shardbearer because of fatigue would not serve his men Well Dalinar demanded of Adolin Say it I have led us to destruction I This is my fault Dalinar said I should never have risked our house for those foolish dreams No Adolin said He sounded surprised at himself for saying it No Father Its not your fault Dalinar stared at his son That was not what hed expected to hear What would you have done differently Adolin asked Would you stop trying to make something better of Alethkar Would you become like Sadeas and the others No I wouldnt have you become that man Father regardless of what it would gain us I wish to the Heralds that we hadnt let Sadeas trick us into this but I will not blame you for his deceit Adolin reached over gripping Dalinars Platecovered arm You are right to follow the Codes You were right to try to unite Alethkar And I was a fool for fighting you on it every step along the path Perhaps if I hadnt spent so much time distracting you we would have seen this day coming Dalinar blinked dumbfounded This was Adolin speaking those words What had changed in the boy And why did he speak these words now at the dawn of Dalinars greatest failure And yet as the words hung in the air Dalinar felt his guilt evaporating blown away by the screams of the dying It was a selfish emotion Would he have had himself change Yes he could have been more cautious He could have been warier of Sadeas But would he have given up on the Codes Would he have become the same pitiless killer hed been as a youth No Did it matter that the visions had been wrong about Sadeas Was he ashamed of the man that they and the readings from the book had made him become The final piece fell into place inside of him the final cornerstone and he found that he was no longer worried The confusion was gone He knew what to do at long last No more questions No more uncertainty He reached up gripping Adolins arm Thank you Adolin nodded curtly He was still angry Dalinar could see but he chose to follow Dalinarand part of following a leader was supporting him even when the battle turned against him Then they released one another and Dalinar turned to the soldiers around them It is time for us to fight he said voice growing louder And we do so not because we seek the glory of men but because the other options are worse We follow the Codes not because they bring gain but because we loathe the people we would otherwise become We stand here on this battlefield alone because of who we are The members of the Cobalt Guard standing in a ring began to turn one at a time looking toward him Beyond them reserve soldierslighteyed and darkgathered closer eyes terrified but faces resolute Death is the end of all men Dalinar bellowed What is the measure of him once he is gone The wealth he accumulated and left for his heirs to squabble over The glory he obtained only to be passed on to those who slew him The lofty positions he held through happenstance No We fight here because we understand The end is the same It is the path that separates men When we taste that end we will do so with our heads held high eyes to the sun He held out a hand summoning Oathbringer I am not ashamed of what I have become he shouted and found it to be true It felt so strange to be free of guilt Other men may debase themselves to destroy me Let them have their glory For I will retain mine The Shardblade formed dropping into his hand The men did not cheer but they did stand taller straightbacked A little of the terror retreated Adolin shoved his helm on his own Blade appearing in his hand coated in condensation He nodded Together they charged back into the battle And so I die Dalinar thought crashing into the Parshendi ranks There he found peace An unexpected emotion on the field of battle but all the more welcome for that He did however discover one regret He was leaving poor Renarin as Kholin highprince in over his head and surrounded by enemies grown fat on the flesh of his father and brother I never did deliver that Shardplate I promised him Dalinar thought He will have to make his way without it Honor of our ancestors protect you son Stay strongand learn wisdom more quickly than your father did Farewell Let me no longer hurt Let me no longer weep Daigonarthis The Black Fisher holds my sorrow and consumes it Tanatesach 1173 28 seconds predeath A darkeyed female street juggler Note similarity to sample 117289 Bridge Four lagged behind the rest of the army With two wounded and four men needed to carry them the bridge weighed them down Fortunately Sadeas had brought nearly every bridge crew on this run including eight to lend to Dalinar That meant the army didnt need to wait for Kaladins team in order to cross Exhaustion saturated Kaladin and the bridge on his shoulders seemed made of stone He hadnt felt so tired since his first days as a bridgeman Syl hovered in front of him watching with concern as he marched at the head of his men sweat drenching the sides of his face struggling over the uneven ground of the plateau Ahead the last of Sadeass army was bunched along the chasm crossing The staging plateau was nearly empty The sheer awful audacity of what Sadeas had done twisted at Kaladins insides He thought what had been done to him had been horrible But here Sadeas callously condemned thousands of men lighteyed and dark Supposed allies That betrayal seemed to weigh as heavy on Kaladin as the bridge itself It pressed on him made him gasp for breath Was there no hope for men They killed those they should have loved What good was it to fight what good was it to win if there was no difference between ally and enemy What was victory Meaningless What did the deaths of Kaladins friends and colleagues mean Nothing The entire world was a pustule sickeningly green and infested with corruption Numb Kaladin and the others reached the chasm though they were too late to help with the transfer The men hed sent ahead were there Teft looking grim Skar leaning on a spear to support his wounded leg A small group of dead spearmen lay nearby Sadeass soldiers retrieved their wounded when possible but some died as they were helped along Theyd abandoned some of those here Sadeas was obviously in a hurry to leave the scene The dead had been left with their equipment Skar had probably gotten his crutch there Some poor bridge crew would have to cross all the way back here at a later date to salvage from these and from Dalinars fallen They set their bridge down and Kaladin wiped his brow Dont place the bridge across the chasm he told the men Well wait until the last of the soldiers have crossed then carry it over on one of the other bridges Matal eyed Kaladin and his team but didnt order them to set their bridge He realized that by the time they got it into position theyd have to pull it up again Isnt that a sight Moash said stepping up beside Kaladin looking back Kaladin turned The Tower rose behind them sloped in their direction Kholins army was a circle of blue trapped in the middle of the slope after trying to push down and get to Sadeas before he left The Parshendi were a dark swarm with specks of red from their marbled skins They pressed at the Alethi ring compressing it Such a shame Drehy said from beside their bridge sitting on its lip Makes me sick Other bridgemen nodded and Kaladin was surprised to see the concern in their faces Rock and Teft joined Kaladin and Moash all wearing their Parshendicarapace armor He was glad theyd left Shen back in the camp Hed have been catatonic at the sight of it all Teft cradled his wounded arm Rock raised a hand to shade his eyes and shook his head looking eastward Is a shame A shame to Sadeas A shame to us Bridge Four Matal called Come on Matal was waving for them to cross Bridge Sixs bridge and leave the staging plateau An idea came to Kaladin suddenly A fantastic idea like a blooming rockbud in his mind Well follow with our own bridge Matal Kaladin called We only just got to the chasm We need to sit for a few minutes Cross now Matal yelled Well just fall further behind Kaladin retorted You want to explain to Sadeas why he has to hold the entire army for one miserable bridge crew Weve got our bridge Let my men rest Well catch up to you later And if those savages come after you Matal demanded Kaladin shrugged Matal blinked then seemed to realize how badly he wanted that to happen Suit yourself he called rushing across bridge six as the other bridges were pulled up In seconds Kaladins team was alone beside the chasm the army retreating westward Kaladin smiled broadly I cant believe it after all that worrying Men were free The others turned to him confused Well follow in a short while Kaladin said eagerly and Matal will assume were coming We fall farther and farther behind the army until were out of sight Then well turn north use the bridge to cross the Plains We can escape northward and everyone will just assume the Parshendi caught us and slaughtered us The other bridgemen regarded him with wide eyes Supplies Teft said We have these spheres Kaladin said pulling out his pouch A wealth of them right here We can take the armor and weapons from the dead over there and use those to defend ourselves from bandits It will be hard but we wont be chased The men were starting to grow excited However something gave Kaladin pause What of the wounded bridgemen back in the camp Ill have to stay behind Kaladin said What Moash demanded Someone will need to Kaladin said For the good of our wounded in camp We cant abandon them And if I stay behind I can support the story Wound me and leave me on one of the plateaus Sadeas is sure to send scavengers back Ill tell them my crew was hunted down in retribution for desecrating the Parshendi corpses our bridge tossed into the chasm Theyll believe it theyve seen how the Parshendi hate us The crew was all standing now shooting glances at one another Uncomfortable glances Were not leaving without you Sigzil said Many of the others nodded Ill follow Kaladin said We cant leave those men behind Kaladin lad Teft began We can talk about me later Kaladin interrupted Maybe Ill go with you then sneak back into camp later to rescue the wounded For now go salvage from those bodies They hesitated Its an order men They moved offering no further complaint rushing to pilfer from the corpses Sadeas had abandoned That left Kaladin alone beside the bridge He was still unsettled It wasnt just the wounded back in camp What was it then This was a fantastic opportunity The type hed have practically killed to get during his years as a slave The chance to vanish presumed dead The bridgemen wouldnt have to fight They were free Why then was he so anxious Kaladin turned to survey his men and was shocked to see someone standing beside him A woman of translucent white light It was Syl as hed never seen her before the size of a regular person hands clasped in front of her hair and dress streaming to the side in the wind Hed had no idea she could make herself so large She stared eastward her expression horrified eyes wide and sorrowful It was the face of a child watching a brutal murder that stole her innocence Kaladin turned and slowly looked in the direction she was staring Toward the Tower Toward Dalinar Kholins desperate army The sight of them twisted his heart They fought so hopelessly Surrounded Abandoned Left alone to die We have a bridge Kaladin realized If we could get it set Most of the Parshendi were focused on the Alethi army with only a token reserve force down at the base near the chasm It was a small enough group that perhaps the bridgemen could contain them But no That was idiocy There were thousands of Parshendi soldiers blocking Kholins path to the chasm And how would the bridgemen set their bridge with no archers to support them Several of the bridgemen returned from their quick scavenge Rock joined Kaladin staring eastward expression becoming grim This thing is terrible he said Can we not do something to help Kaladin shook his head It would be suicide Rock Wed have to run a full assault without an army to support us Couldnt we just go back a little of the way Skar asked Wait to see if Kholin can cut his way down to us If he does then we could set our bridge No Kaladin said If we stayed out of range Kholin would assume us to be scouts left by Sadeas Well have to charge the chasm Otherwise hed never come down to meet us That made the bridgemen pale Besides Kaladin added If we did somehow save some of those men theyd talk and Sadeas would know we still live Hed hunt us down and kill us By going back wed throw away our chance at freedom The other bridgemen nodded at that The rest had gathered carrying weapons It was time to go Kaladin tried to squelch the feeling of despair inside him This Dalinar Kholin was probably just like the others Like Roshone like Sadeas like any number of other lighteyes Pretending virtue but corrupted inside But he has thousands of darkeyed soldiers with him a part of him thought Men who dont deserve this terrible fate Men like my old spear crew We owe them nothing Kaladin whispered He thought could see Dalinar Kholins banner flying blue at the front of his army You got them into this Kholin I wont let my men die for you He turned his back on the Tower Syl still stood beside him facing eastward It made his very soul twist in knots to see that look of despair on her face Are windspren attracted to wind she asked softly or do they make it I dont know Kaladin said Does it matter Perhaps not You see Ive remembered what kind of spren I am Is this the time for it Syl I bind things Kaladin she said turning and meeting his eyes I am honorspren Spirit of oaths Of promises And of nobility Kaladin could faintly hear the sounds of the battle Or was that just his mind searching for something he knew to be there Could he hear the men dying Could he see the soldiers running away scattering leaving their warlord alone Everyone else fleeing Kaladin kneeling over Dallets body A greenandburgundy banner flying alone on the field Ive been here before Kaladin bellowed turning back toward that blue banner Dalinar always fought at the front What happened last time Kaladin yelled Ive learned I wont be a fool again It seemed to crush him Sadeass betrayal his exhaustion the deaths of so many He was there again for a moment kneeling in Amarams mobile headquarters watching the last of his friends being slaughtered too weak and hurt to save them He raised a trembling hand to his head feeling the brand there wet with his sweat I owe you nothing Kholin And his fathers voice seemed to whisper a reply Somebody has to start son Somebody has to step forward and do what is right because it is right If nobody starts then others can not follow Dalinar had come to help Kaladins men attacking those archers and saving Bridge Four The lighteyes dont care about life Lirin had said So I must So we must So you must Life before death Ive failed so often Ive been knocked to the ground and trod upon Strength before weakness This would be death Id lead my friends to Journey before destinationdeath and what is right We have to go back Kaladin said softly Storm it we have to go back He turned to the members of Bridge Four One by one they nodded Men who had been the dregs of the army just months beforemen who had once cared for nothing but their own skinstook deep breaths tossed away thoughts for their own safety and nodded They would follow him Kaladin looked up and sucked in a deep breath Stormlight rushed into him like a wave as if hed put his lips up to a highstorm and drawn it into himself Bridge up he commanded The members of Bridge Four cheered their agreement grabbing their bridge and hoisting it high Kaladin pulled on a shield grabbing the straps in his hand Then he turned raising it high With a shout he led his men in a charge back toward that abandoned blue banner Dalinars Plate leaked Stormlight from dozens of small breaks no major piece had escaped Light rose above him like steam from a cauldron lingering as Stormlight did slowly diffusing The sun beat down upon him baking him as he fought He was so tired It hadnt been long since Sadeass betrayal not as time was counted in battles But Dalinar had pushed himself hard staying at the very front fighting side by side with Adolin His Plate had lost much Stormlight It was growing heavier and lent him less power with each swing Soon it would weigh him down slowing him so the Parshendi could swarm over him Hed killed many of them So many A frightening number and he did it without the Thrill He was hollow inside Better that than pleasure He hadnt killed nearly enough of them They focused on Dalinar and Adolin with Shardbearers on the front line any breach would soon be patched by a man in gleaming armor and a deadly Blade The Parshendi had to bring him and Adolin down first They knew it Dalinar knew it Adolin knew it Stories spoke of battlefields where the Shardbearers were the last ones standing pulled down by their enemies after long heroic fights Completely unrealistic If you killed the Shardbearers first you could take their Blades and turn them against the enemy He swung again muscles lagging with fatigue Dying first It was a good place to be Ask nothing of them you wouldnt do yourself Dalinar stumbled on the rocks his Shardplate feeling as heavy as regular armor He could be satisfied with the way hed handled his own life But his men he had failed them Thinking of the way he had stupidly led then into a trap that sickened him And then there was Navani Of all the times to finally begin courting her Dalinar thought Six years wasted A lifetime wasted And now shell have to grieve again That thought made him raise his arms and steady his feet on the stone He fought off the Parshendi Struggling on For her He would not let himself fall while he still had strength Nearby Adolins armor leaked as well The youth was extending himself more and more to protect his father There had been no discussion of trying perhaps to leap the chasms and flee With chasms so wide the chances were slimbut beyond that they would not abandon their men to die He and Adolin had lived by the Codes They would die by the Codes Dalinar swung again staying at Adolins side fighting in that justoutofreach tandem way of two Shardbearers Sweat streamed down his face inside his helm and he shot a final glance toward the disappearing army It was just barely visible on the horizon Dalinars current position gave him a good view down to the west Let that man be cursed for For Blood of my fathers what is that A small force was moving across the western plateau running toward the Tower A solitary bridge crew carrying their bridge It cant be Dalinar said stepping back from the fighting letting the Cobalt Guardwhat was left of themrush in to defend him Distrusting his eyes he pushed his visor up The rest of Sadeass army was gone but this single bridge crew remained Why Adolin he bellowed pointing with his Shardblade a surge of hope flooding his limbs The young man turned tracing Dalinars gesture Adolin froze Impossible he yelled What kind of trap is that A foolish one if it is a trap We are already dead But why would he send one back What purpose Does it matter They hesitated for a moment amid the battle Both knew the answer Assault formations Dalinar yelled turning back to his troops Stormfather there were so few of them left Less than half of his original eight thousand Form up Adolin called Get ready to move Were going to punch through them men Gather everything youve got Weve got one chance A slim one Dalinar thought pulling his visor down Well have to cut through the rest of the Parshendi army Even if they reached the bottom theyd probably find the crew dead their bridge cast into the chasm The Parshendi archers were already forming up there were more than a hundred of them It would be a slaughter But it was a hope A tiny precious hope If his army was going to fall it would do so while trying to seize that hope Raising his Shardblade high feeling a surge of strength and determination Dalinar charged forward at the head of his men For the second time in one day Kaladin ran toward an armed Parshendi position shield before him wearing armor cut from the corpse of a fallen enemy Perhaps he should have felt revolted at what hed done in creating his armor But it was no worse than what the Parshendi had done in killing Dunny Maps and that nameless man who had shown Kaladin kindness on his first day as a bridgemen Kaladin still wore that mans sandals Us and them he thought That was the only way a soldier could think of it For today Dalinar Kholin and his men were part of the us A group of Parshendi had seen the bridgemen approaching and was setting up with bows Fortunately it appeared that Dalinar had seen Kaladins band as well for the army in blue was beginning to cut its way toward rescue It wasnt going to work There were too many Parshendi and Dalinars men would be tired It was another disaster But for once Kaladin charged into it with eyes wide open This is my choice he thought as the Parshendi archers formed up Its not some angry god watching me not some spren playing tricks not some twist of fate Its me I chose to follow Tien I chose to charge the Shardbearer and save Amaram I chose to escape the slave pits And now I choose to try to rescue these men though I know I will probably fail The Parshendi loosed their arrows and Kaladin felt an exaltation Tiredness evaporated fatigue fled He wasnt fighting for Sadeas He wasnt working to line someones pockets He was fighting to protect The arrows zipped at him and he swung his shield in an arc spraying them away Others came shooting this way and that seeking his flesh He stayed just ahead of them leaping as they shot for his thighs turning as they shot for his shoulders raising his shield when they shot for his face It wasnt easy and more than a few arrows got close to him scoring his breastplate or shin guards But none hit He was doing it He was Something was wrong He spun between two arrows confused Kaladin Syl said hovering nearby back to her smaller form There She pointed toward the other staging plateau the one nearby that Dalinar had used for his assault A large contingent of Parshendi had jumped across to that plateau and were kneeling down raising bows Pointed not at him but right at Bridge Fours unshielded flank No Kaladin screamed Stormlight escaping from his mouth in a cloud He turned and ran back across the rocky plateau toward the bridge crew Arrows launched at him from behind One took his backplate square on but skidded aside Another hit his helm He leaped over a rocky rift dashing with all the speed his Stormlight could lend him The Parshendi at the side were drawing There were at least fifty of them He was going to be too late He was going to Bridge Four he bellowed Side carry right They hadnt practiced that maneuver in weeks but their training was manifest as they obeyed without question dropping the bridge to their side just as the archers loosed The flight of arrows hit the bridges deck bristling across the wood Kaladin let out a relieved breath reaching the bridge team who had slowed to carry the bridge on the side Kaladin Rock said pointing Kaladin spun The archers behind on the Tower were drawing for a large volley The bridge crew was exposed The archers loosed He yelled again screaming out Stormlight infusing the air around him as he threw every bit of it he had into his shield The scream echoed in his ears the Stormlight burst from him his clothing freezing and cracking Arrows darkened the sky Something hit him an extended impact that tossed him backward into the bridgemen He struck hard grunting as the force continued to push upon him The bridge ground to a halt the men stopping All fell still Kaladin blinked feeling completely drained His body hurt his arms tingled his back ached There was a sharp pain in his wrist He groaned opening his eyes stumbling as Rocks hands caught him from behind A muted thump The bridge being set down Idiots Kaladin thought Dont set it down Retreat The bridgemen crowded around him as he slipped to the ground overwhelmed by having expended too much Stormlight He blinked at what he held before him attached to his bleeding arm His shield was covered in arrows dozens of them some splitting the others The bones crossing the shields front had shattered the wood was in splinters Some of the arrows had gone through and hit his forearm That was the pain Over a hundred arrows An entire volley Pulled into a single shield By the Brightcallers rays Drehy said softly What what was It was like a fountain of light Moash said kneeling beside Kaladin Like the sun itself burst from you Kaladin The Parshendi Kaladin croaked and let go of the shield The straps were broken and as he struggled to stand the shield all but disintegrated falling to pieces scattering dozens of broken arrows at his feet A few remained stuck in his arm but he ignored the pain looking across at the Parshendi The groups of archers on both plateaus froze in stunned postures The ones in front began to call to one another in a language Kaladin didnt understand Neshua Kadal They stood up And then they fled What Kaladin said I dont know Teft said cradling his own wounded arm But were getting you to safety Blast this arm Lopen The shorter man brought Dabbid and they ushered Kaladin away to a more secure location toward the center of the plateau He held his arm numb his exhaustion so deep that he could barely think Bridge up Moash called Weve still got a job to do The rest of the bridgemen grimly ran back to their bridge hoisting it up On the Tower Dalinars force was fighting its way through the Parshendi toward the possible safety of the bridge crew They must be taking such heavy losses Kaladin thought numbly He stumbled and fell to the ground Teft and Lopen pulled Kaladin into a sheltered hollow joining Skar and Dabbid Skars foot bandage reddened with seeping blood the spear hed been using as a staff resting beside him Thought I told him to stay off that foot We need spheres Teft said Skar He asked for them this morning the lean man said Gave him everything I had I think most of the men did the same Teft cursed softly pulling the remaining arrows from Kaladins arm then wrapping it with bandages Is he going to be all right Skar asked I dont know Teft said I dont know anything Kelek Im an idiot Kaladin Lad can you hear me Its just shock Kaladin said Youre looking strange gancho Lopen said nervously White Your skin is ashen lad Teft said It looks like you did something to yourself back there I dont know I He cursed again smacking his hand against the stone I should have listened Idiot Theyd laid him on his side and he could barely see the Tower New groups of Parshendiones who hadnt seen Kaladins displaywere making for the chasm bearing weapons Bridge Four arrived and set down their bridge They unstrapped their shields and hurriedly retrieved spears from the sacks of salvage tied at the bridges side Then the men went to their positions pushing at the sides preparing to slide the bridge across the gap The Parshendi teams didnt have bows They formed up to wait weapons out There were easily three times as many as there were bridgemen and more were coming Weve got to go help Skar said to Lopen and Teft The other two nodded and all threetwo wounded and one missing an armclimbed to their feet Kaladin tried to do likewise but he fell back down legs too weak to hold him Stay lad Teft said smiling Well handle it just fine They gathered some spears from a stock Lopen had put in his litter then hobbled out to join the bridge crew Even Dabbid joined them He hadnt spoken since being wounded on that first bridge run so long ago Kaladin crawled up to the lip of the depression watching them Syl landed on the stone beside him Storming fools Kaladin muttered Shouldnt have followed me Proud of them anyway Kaladin Syl said Is there anything you can do He was so storming tired Something to make me stronger She shook her head A short distance ahead the bridgemen began to push The bridges wood scraped loudly as it crossed the rocks moving out over the chasm toward the waiting Parshendi They began singing that harsh battle song the one they did whenever they saw Kaladin in his armor The Parshendi looked eager angry deadly They wanted blood They would cut into the bridgemen and rip them apart then drop the bridge and their corpsesinto the void beneath Its happening again Kaladin thought dazed and overwhelmed He found himself curling up drained and shaken I cant get to them Theyll die Right before me Tukks Dead Nelda Dead Goshel Dead Dallet Cenn Maps Dunny Dead Dead Dead Tien Dead Lying huddled in a hollow in the rock The sounds of battle ringing in the distance Death surrounding him In a moment he was there again on that most horrible of days Kaladin stumbled through the cursing screaming fighting chaos of war clinging to his spear Hed dropped his shield He needed to find a shield somewhere Shouldnt he have a shield It was his third real battle Hed been in Amarams army only a few months but already Hearthstone seemed a world away He reached a hollow of rock and crouched down pushing his back to it breathing in and out fingers slick on the spears shaft He was shaking Hed never realized how idyllic his life had been Away from war Away from death Away from those screams the cacophony of metal on metal metal on wood metal on flesh He squeezed his eyes shut trying to block it out No he thought Open your eyes Dont let them find you and kill you that easily He forced his eyes open then turned and peeked out over the battlefield It was a complete mess They fought on a large hillside thousands of men on either side intermixing and killing How could anyone keep track of anything in this insanity Amarams armyKaladins armywas trying to hold the hilltop Another army also Alethi was trying to take it from them That was all Kaladin knew The enemy seemed more numerous than his own army Hell be safe Kaladin thought He will be But he had trouble convincing himself Tiens stint as a messenger boy hadnt lasted long Recruitment was down hed been told and every hand that could hold a spear was needed Tien and the other older messenger boys had been organized into several squads of deep reserves Dalar said those wouldnt ever be used Probably Unless the army was in serious danger Did being surrounded atop a steep hill their lines in chaos constitute serious danger Get to the top he thought looking up the incline Amarams banner still flew up there Their soldiers must be holding All Kaladin could see was a churning mess of men in orange and the occasional bit of forest green Kaladin took off at a run up the side of the hill He didnt turn as men shouted at him didnt check to see which side they were from Patches of grass pulled down in front of him He stumbled over a few corpses dashed around a couple of scraggly stumpweight trees and avoided places where men were fighting There he thought noting a group of spearmen ahead standing in a line watching warily Green Amarams colors Kaladin scrambled up to them and the soldiers let him pass Which squad are you from soldier said a stocky lighteyed man with the knots of a low captain Dead sir Kaladin forced out All dead We were in Brightlord Tashlins company and Bah the man said turning to a runner Third report weve had that Tashlin is down Somebody warn Amaram East side is weakening by degrees He looked to Kaladin You off to the reserves for reassignment Yes sir Kaladin said numb He glanced down the way hed come The incline was littered with corpses many of them in green Even as he watched a group of three stragglers rushing for the top was intercepted and slaughtered None of the men at the top moved to help them Kaladin could have fallen just as easily within yards of safety He knew that it was probably important strategically that these soldiers in the line maintain their positions But it seemed so heartless Find Tien he thought trotting off toward the reserves field on the north side of the wide hilltop Here however he found only more chaos Groups of dazed men bloodied getting sorted into new squads and sent back out onto the field Kaladin moved through them searching for the squad that had been created out of the messenger boys He found Dalar first The lanky threefingered sergeant of the reserves stood beside a tall post bearing a pair of flapping triangular banners He was assigning newly made squads to fill out losses in the companies fighting below Kaladin could still hear the yells You Dalar said pointing at Kaladin Squad reassignment is in that direction Get moving I need to find the squad made from messenger boys Kaladin said Why in Damnation do you want to know that How should I know Kaladin said shrugging trying to remain calm I just follow orders Dalar grunted Brightlord Shelers company Southeast side You can Kaladin was already running This wasnt supposed to happen Tien was supposed to stay safe Stormfather It hadnt even been four months yet He made his way to the southeast side of the hill and searched out a banner flapping a quarter of the way down the incline The stark black glyphpair read shesh lerelShelers company Surprised at his own determination Kaladin brushed past the soldiers guarding the hilltop and found himself on the battlefield again Things looked better over here Shelers company was holding its ground although assaulted by a wave of enemies Kaladin dashed down the incline skidding in places sliding on blood His fear had vanished It had been replaced by worry for his brother He arrived at the company line just as enemy squads were assaulting He tried to scramble farther behind the lines to search for Tien but he was caught in the wave of attacks He stumbled to the side joining a squad of spearmen The enemy was on them in a second Kaladin held his spear in two hands standing at the edge of the other spearmen and trying not to get in their way He didnt really know what he was doing He barely knew enough to use his shieldmate for protection The exchange happened quickly and Kaladin made only a single thrust The enemy was rebuffed and he managed to avoid taking a wound He stood panting gripping his spear You an authoritative voice said A man was pointing at Kaladin knots at his shoulders The squadleader About time my team got some of those reinforcements For a time there I thought Varth was going to get every man Wheres your shield Kaladin scrambled to grab one off a fallen soldier nearby As he was working the squadleader swore behind him Damnation Theyre coming again Two prongs this time We cant hold like this A man in a green messengers vest scrambled over a nearby rock formation Hold against the east assault Mesh What about that wave to the south the squadleaderMeshbellowed Its handled for now Hold east Those are your orders The messenger scrambled on delivering a similar message to the next squad in line Varth Your squad is to hold east Kaladin got up with his shield He needed to go find Tien He couldnt He stumbled to a stop There in the next squad down the line stood three figures Younger boys looking small in their armor and holding their spears uncertainly One was Tien His team of reserves had obviously been split apart to fill holes in other squads Tien Kaladin screamed falling out of line as the enemy troops came upon them Why were Tien and the other two positioned in the middle front of the squad formation They barely knew how to hold a spear Mesh yelled after Kaladin but Kaladin ignored him The enemy was upon them in a moment and Meshs squad broke losing their discipline and turning to a more frenzied unorganized resistance Kaladin felt something like a thump against his leg He stumbled hitting the ground and realized with shock that hed been stabbed with a spear He felt no pain Odd Tien he thought forcing himself up Someone loomed above him and Kaladin reacted immediately rolling as a spear came down for his heart His own spear was back in his hands before he realized hed grabbed it and he whipped it upward Then he froze Hed just driven his spear through the enemy soldiers neck It had happened so quickly I just killed a man He rolled over letting the enemy drop to his knees as Kaladin yanked his spear free Varths squad was back a little farther The enemy hit it a little while after attacking where Kaladin had been Tien and the other two were still in the front Tien Kaladin yelled The boy looked toward him eyes opening wide He actually smiled Behind him the rest of the squad pulled back Leaving the three untrained boys exposed And sensing weakness the enemy soldiers descended on Tien and the others There was an armored lighteyes at their front in gleaming steel He swung a sword Kaladins brother fell just like that One eyeblink and he was standing there looking terrified The next he was on the ground No Kaladin screamed He tried to get to his feet but slipped to his knees His leg didnt work right Varths squad hurried forward attacking the enemieswho had been distracted with Tien and the other two Theyd placed the untrained at the front to stop the momentum of the enemy attack No no no Kaladin screamed He used his spear to hoist himself to his feet then stumbled forward It couldnt be what he thought It couldnt be over that quickly It was a miracle that nobody struck Kaladin down as he stumbled the rest of the distance He barely thought about it He just watched where Tien had fallen There was thunder No Hooves Amaram had arrived with his cavalry and they were sweeping through the enemy lines Kaladin didnt care He finally reached the spot There he found three corpses young small lying in a hollow in the stone Horrified numb Kaladin reached out his hand and rolled over the one that was facedown Tiens dead eyes stared upward Kaladin continued to kneel beside the body He should have bound his wound should have moved back to safety but he was too numb He just knelt About time he rode down here a voice said Kaladin looked up noting a group of spearmen gathering nearby watching the cavalry He wanted them to bunch up against us one the spearmen said He had knots on the shoulders Varth their squadleader Such keen eyes the man had Not a brutish lout Lean thoughtful I should feel anger Kaladin thought I should feel something Varth looked down at him then at the bodies of the three dead messenger boys You bastard Kaladin hissed You put them in front You work with what you have Varth said nodding to his team then pointing at a fortified position If they give me men who cant fight Ill find another use for them He hesitated as his team marched away He seemed regretful Got ta do what you can to stay alive son Turn a liability into an advantage whenever you can Remember that if you live With that he jogged off Kaladin looked down Why couldnt I protect him he thought looking at Tien remembering his brothers laugh His innocence his smile his excitement at exploring the hills outside Hearthstone Please Please let me protect him Make me strong enough He felt so weak Blood loss He found himself slumping to the side and with tired hands he tied off his wound And then feeling terribly vacant inside he lay down beside Tien and pulled the body close Dont worry Kaladin whispered When had he started to cry Ill bring you home Ill protect you Tien Ill bring you back He held the body into the evening long past the end of the battle clinging to it as it slowly grew cold Kaladin blinked He wasnt in that hollow with Tien He was on the plateau He could hear men dying in the distance He hated thinking of that day He almost wished hed never gone looking for Tien Then he wouldnt have had to watch Wouldnt have had to kneel there powerless as his brother was slaughtered It was happening again Rock Moash Teft They were all going to die And here he lay powerless again He could barely move He felt so drained Kaladin a voice whispered He blinked Syl was hovering in front of him Do you know the Words All I wanted to do was protect them he whispered Thats why Ive come The Words Kaladin Theyre going to die I cant save them I Amaram slaughtered his men in front of him A nameless Shardbearer killed Dallet A lighteyes killed Tien No Kaladin rolled over and forced himself to his feet wavering on weak legs No Bridge Four hadnt set its bridge yet That surprised him They were still pushing it across the chasm the Parshendi crowding up on the other side eager their song becoming more frantic His delusions had seemed like hours but had passed in just a few heartbeats NO Lopens litter was in front of Kaladin A spear rested amid the drained water bottles and ragged bandages steel head reflecting sunlight It whispered to him It terrified him and he loved it When the time comes I hope youre ready Because this lot will need you He seized the spear the first real weapon he had held since his display in the chasm so many weeks ago Then he started to run Slowly at first Picking up speed Reckless his body exhausted But he did not stop He pushed forward harder charging toward the bridge It was only halfway across the chasm Syl shot out in front of him looking back worried The Words Kaladin Rock cried out as Kaladin ran onto the bridge as it was moving The wood wobbled beneath him It was out over the chasm but hadnt reached the other side Kaladin Teft yelled What are you doing Kaladin screamed reaching the end of the bridge Finding a tiny surge of strength somewhere he raised his spear and threw himself off the end of the wooden platform launching into the air above the cavernous void Bridgemen cried out in dismay Syl zipped about him with worry Parshendi looked up with amazement as a lone bridgeman sailed through the air toward them His drained wornout body barely had any strength left In that moment of crystallized time he looked down on his enemies Parshendi with their marbled red and black skin Soldiers raising finely crafted weapons as if to cut him from the sky Strangers oddities in carapace breastplates and skullcaps Many of them wearing beards Beards woven with glowing gemstones Kaladin breathed in Like the power of salvation itselflike rays of sunlight from the eyes of the AlmightyStormlight exploded from those gemstones It streamed through the air pulled in visible streams like glowing columns of luminescent smoke Twisting and turning and spiraling like tiny funnel clouds until they slammed into him And the storm came to life again Kaladin hit the rocky ledge legs suddenly strong mind body and blood alive with energy He fell into a crouch spear under his arm a small ring of Stormlight expanding from him in a wave pushed down to the stones by his fall Stunned the Parshendi shied away eyes widening song faltering A trickle of Stormlight closed the wounds on his arm He smiled spear held before him It was as familiar as the body of a lover long lost The Words a voice said urgent as if directly into his mind In that moment Kaladin was amazed to realize that he knew them though theyd never been told to him I will protect those who can not protect themselves he whispered The Second Ideal of the Knights Radiant A crack shook the air like an enormous clap of thunder though the sky was completely clear Teft stumbled backhaving just set the bridge in placeand found himself gaping with the rest of Bridge Four Kaladin exploded with energy A burst of whiteness washed out from him a wave of white smoke Stormlight The force of it slammed into the first rank of Parshendi tossing them backward and Teft had to hold his hand up against the vibrancy of the light Something just changed Moash whispered hand up Something important Kaladin raised his spear The powerful light began to subside retreating A more subdued glow began to steam off his body Radiant like smoke from an ethereal fire Nearby some of the Parshendi fled though others stepped up raising weapons in challenge Kaladin spun into them a living storm of steel wood and determination They named it the Final Desolation but they lied Our gods lied Oh how they lied The Everstorm comes I hear its whispers see its stormwall know its heart Tanatanes 1173 8 seconds predeath An Azish itinerant worker Sample of particular note Soldiers in blue yelled screaming war cries to encourage themselves The sounds were like a roaring avalanche behind Adolin as he swung his Blade in wild swings There was no room for a proper stance He had to keep moving punching through the Parshendi leading his men toward the western chasm His fathers horse and his own were still safe carrying some wounded through the back ranks The Shardbearers didnt dare mount though In these close quarters the Ryshadium would be chopped down and their riders dropped This was the type of battlefield maneuver that would have been impossible without Shardbearers A rush against superior numbers Made by wounded exhausted men They should have been stopped cold and crushed But Shardbearers could not be stopped so easily Their armor leaking Stormlight their sixfoot Blades flashing in wide swaths Adolin and Dalinar shattered the Parshendi defenses creating an opening a rift Their menthe besttrained in the Alethi warcampsknew how to use it They formed a wedge behind their Shardbearers prying the Parshendi armies open using spearman formations to cut through and keep going forward Adolin moved at almost a jog The incline of the hill worked in their favor giving them better footing letting them rumble down the slope like charging chulls The chance to survive when all had been thought lost gave the men a surge of energy for one last dash toward freedom They took enormous casualties Already Dalinars force had lost another thousand of his four probably more But it didnt matter The Parshendi fought to kill but the Alethithis timefought to live Living Heralds above Teft thought watching Kaladin fight Just moments ago the lad had looked near death skin a dull grey hands shaking Now he was a shining whirlwind a storm wielding a spear Teft had known many a battlefield but he had never seen anything remotely like this Kaladin held the ground before the bridge by himself White Stormlight streamed from him like a blazing fire His speed was incredible nearly inhuman and his precisioneach thrust of the spear hit a neck side or other unarmored target of Parshendi flesh It was more than the Stormlight Teft had only a fragmentary recollection of the things his family had tried to teach him but those memories all agreed Stormlight did not grant skill It could not make a man into something he was not It enhanced it strengthened it invigorated It perfected Kaladin ducked low slamming the butt against the leg of a Parshendi dropping him to the ground and came up to block an axe swing by catching the haft with that of his spear He let go with one hand sweeping the tip of the spear up under the arm of the Parshendi and ramming it into his armpit As that Parshendi fell Kaladin pulled his spear free and slammed the end into a Parshendi head that had gotten too close The butt of the spear shattered with a spray of wood and the Parshendis carapace helm exploded No this wasnt just Stormlight This was a master of the spear with his capacity enhanced to astonishing levels The bridgemen gathered around Teft amazed His wounded arm didnt seem to hurt as much as it should Hes like a part of the wind itself Drehy said Pulled down and given life Not a man at all A spren Sigzil Skar asked eyes wide You ever seen anything like this The darkskinned man shook his head Stormfather Peet whispered What what is he Hes our bridgeleader Teft said snapping out of his reverie On the other side of the chasm Kaladin barely dodged a blow from a Parshendi mace And he needs our help First and second teams you take the left side Dont let the Parshendi get around him Third and fourth teams youre with me on the right Rock and Lopen you be ready to pull back any wounded The rest of you wrinkled wall formation Dont attack just stay alive and keep them back And Lopen toss him a spear that isnt broken Dalinar roared striking down a group of Parshendi swordsmen He charged over their bodies running up a short incline and throwing himself in a leap dropping several feet into the Parshendi below sweeping out with his Blade His armor was an enormous weight upon his back but the energy of his struggle kept him going The Cobalt Guardthe straggling members who were leftroared and leaped off the incline behind him They were doomed Those bridgemen would be dead by now But Dalinar blessed them for their sacrifice It might have been meaningless as an end but it had changed the journey This was how his soldiers should fallnot cornered and frightened but fighting with passion He would not slide quietly into the dark No indeed He shouted his defiance again as he smashed into a group of Parshendi whirling and hauling his Shardblade in a circling sweep He stumbled through the patch of dead Parshendi their eyes burning as they fell And Dalinar burst out onto open stone He blinked stunned We did it he thought in disbelief We cut all the way through Behind him soldiers roared their tired voices sounding nearly as amazed as he felt Just ahead of him a final group of Parshendi lay between Dalinar and the chasm But their backs were turned to him Why were they The bridgemen The bridgemen were fighting Dalinar gaped lowering Oathbringer with numb arms That little force of bridgemen held the bridgehead fighting desperately against the Parshendi who were trying to force them back It was the most amazing most glorious thing Dalinar had ever seen Adolin let out a whoop breaking through the Parshendi to Dalinars left The younger mans armor was scratched cracked and scored and his helm had shattered leaving his head dangerously exposed But his face was exultant Go go Dalinar bellowed pointing Give them support storm it If those bridgemen fall were all dead Adolin and the Cobalt Guard dashed forward Gallant and Sureblood Adolins Ryshadium galloped past carrying three wounded each Dalinar hated to have left so many wounded on the slopes but the Codes were clear In this case protecting the men he could save was more important Dalinar turned to strike at the main body of Parshendi to his left making certain the corridor remained open for his troops Many of the soldiers scrambled toward safety though several squads proved their mettle by forming up at the sides to keep fighting opening the gap wider Sweat had soaked through the brow rag attached to Dalinars helm and drops of it fell overwhelming his eyebrows and falling into his left eye He cursed reaching to open his visorthen froze The enemy troops were parting There standing among them was a sevenfoottall giant of a Parshendi in gleaming silver Shardplate It fit as only Plate could having molded to his large stature His Shardblade was wicked and barbed like flames frozen into metal He raised it to Dalinar in a salute Now Dalinar bellowed incredulously Now you come The Shardbearer stepped forward steel boots clanking on stone The other Parshendi backed away Why not earlier Dalinar demanded hurriedly setting himself into Windstance blinking his left eye against the sweat He stood near the shadow of a large oblong rock formation shaped like a book on its side Why wait out the entire battle only to attack now When When Dalinar was about to get away Apparently the Parshendi Shardbearer had been willing to let his fellows throw themselves at Dalinar when it seemed obvious he would fall Perhaps they let the regular soldiers try to win Shards as was done in human armies Now that Dalinar might escape the potential loss of a Plate and Blade was too great and so the Shardbearer had been sent to fight him The Shardbearer stepped up speaking in the thick Parshendi language Dalinar didnt understand a word of it He raised his Blade and fell into stance The Parshendi said something further then grunted and stepped forward swinging Dalinar cursed to himself still blinded in his left eye He dodged back swinging his Blade and slapping the enemys weapon The parry shook Dalinar inside his armor His muscles responded sluggishly Stormlight still leaked from cracks in his armor but it was abating It wouldnt be much longer before the Plate stopped responding The Parshendi Shardbearer attacked again His stance was unfamiliar to Dalinar but there was something practiced about it This wasnt a savage playing with a powerful weapon He was a trained Shardbearer Dalinar was once again forced to parry something Windstance wasnt intended do to His weightladen muscles were too sluggish to dodge and his Plate was too cracked to risk letting himself get hit The blow nearly threw him out of stance He clenched his teeth throwing weight behind his weapon and intentionally overcorrecting as the Parshendis next blow came The Blades met with a furious clang throwing off a shower of sparks like a bucket of molten metal dashed into the air Dalinar recovered quickly and threw himself forward trying to slam his shoulder into his enemys chest The Parshendi was still full of power however his Plate uncracked He got out of the way and quite nearly hit Dalinar on the back Dalinar twisted just in time Then he turned and leaped onto a small rock formation then stepped to a higher ledge and managed to reach the top The Parshendi followed as Dalinar had hoped The precarious footing raised the stakeswhich was just fine with him A single blow could ruin Dalinar That meant taking risks As the Parshendi neared the top of the formation Dalinar attacked using the advantage of surer footing and high ground The Parshendi didnt bother dodging He took a hit to the helm which cracked but gained a chance to swing at Dalinars legs Dalinar leaped backward feeling painfully sluggish He barely got out of the way and wasnt able to get in a second strike as the Parshendi climbed atop the formation The Parshendi man made an aggressive thrust Setting his jaw Dalinar raised his forearm to block and stepped into the attack praying to the Heralds that his forearm plate would deflect the blow The Parshendi blade connected shattering the Plate sending a shock up Dalinars arm The gauntlet on his fist suddenly felt like a lead weight but Dalinar kept moving swinging his blade for his own attack Not at the Parshendis armor but at the stone beneath him Even as the molten shards of Dalinars forearm plate sprayed in the air he sheared through the rock shelf under his opponents feet The entire section broke free sending the Shardbearer tumbling backward toward the ground He hit with a crash Dalinar slammed his fistthe one with the broken armguardinto the ground and released the gauntlet It unlatched and he pulled his hand free into the air sweat making it feel cold He left the gauntletit wouldnt work properly now that the forearm piece was goneand roared as he swung his Blade singlehanded He sliced through another chunk of the rock and sent it falling down toward the Shardbearer The Parshendi stumbled to his feet but the rock smashed down on top of him sending out a splash of Stormlight and a deep cracking sound Dalinar climbed down trying to get to the Parshendi while he was still Unfortunately Dalinars right leg was dragging and when he reached the ground he walked in a limp If he took the boot off he wouldnt be able to hold up the rest of the Shardplate He gritted his teeth stopping as the Parshendi stood up Hed been too slow The Parshendis armor though cracked in several places was nowhere near as strained as Dalinars Impressively hed managed to retain his Shardblade He leveled his armored head at Dalinar eyes hidden behind the slit in the helm Around them the other Parshendi watched silently forming a ring but not interfering Dalinar raised his Blade holding it in one gauntleted hand and one bare one The breeze was cold on his clammy exposed hand There was no use running He fought here For the first time in many many months Kaladin felt fully awake and alive The beauty of the spear whistling in the air The unity of body and mind hands and feet reacting instantly faster than thoughts could be formed The clarity and familiarity of the old spear forms learned during the most terrible time in his life His weapon was an extension of himself he moved it as easily and instinctively as he did his fingers Spinning he cut through the Parshendi bringing retribution to those who had slaughtered so many of his friends Repayment for each and every arrow loosed at his flesh With Stormlight making an ecstatic pulse within him he felt a rhythm to the battle Almost like the beat of the Parshendi song And they did sing Theyd recovered from seeing him drink in the Stormlight and speak the Words of the Second Ideal They now attacked in waves fervently trying to get to the bridge and knock it free Some had leaped to the other side to attack from that direction but Moash had led bridgemen to respond there Amazingly they held Syl twirled around Kaladin in a blur riding the waves of Stormlight that rose from his skin moving like a leaf on the winds of a storm Enraptured Hed never seen her like this before He didnt break his attacksin a way there was only one attack as each strike flowed directly into the next His spear never stopped and together with his men he pushed the Parshendi back accepting each challenge as they stepped forward in pairs Killing Slaughtering Blood flew in the air and the dying groaned at his feet He tried not to pay too much attention to that They were the enemy Yet the sheer glory of what he did seemed at odds with the desolation he caused He was protecting He was saving Yet he was killing How could something so terrible be so beautiful at the same time He ducked the swing of a fine silvery sword then brought his spear around to the side crushing ribs He spun the spear shattering its already fractured length against the side of the Parshendis comrade He threw the remains at a third man then caught a new spear as Lopen tossed it to him The Herdazian was collecting them from the fallen Alethi nearby to give to Kaladin when needed When you engaged a man you learned something about him Were your enemies careful and precise Did they bully their way forward aggressive and domineering Did they spout curses to make you enraged Were they ruthless or did they leave an obviously incapacitated man to live He was impressed by the Parshendi He fought dozens of them each with a slightly different style of combat It seemed they were sending only two or four at him at a time Their attacks were careful and controlled and each pair fought as a team They seemed to respect him for his skill Most telling they seemed to back away from fighting Skar or Teft who were wounded instead focusing on Kaladin Moash and the other spearmen who showed the most skill These were not the wild uncultured savages he had been led to expect These were professional soldiers who held to an honorable battlefield ethic he had found absent in most of the Alethi In them he found what hed always hoped he would find in the soldiers of the Shattered Plains That realization rocked him He found himself respecting the Parshendi as he killed them In the end the storm within drove him forward He had chosen a course and these Parshendi would slaughter Dalinar Kholins army without a moments regret Kaladin had committed himself He would see himself and his men through it He wasnt certain how long he fought Bridge Four held out remarkably well Surely they didnt fight for very long otherwise they would have been overwhelmed Yet the multitude of wounded and dying Parshendi around Kaladin seemed to indicate hours He was both relieved and oddly disappointed when a figure in Plate broke through the Parshendi ranks releasing a flood of soldiers in blue Kaladin reluctantly stepped back heart thumping the storm within dampened The light had stopped streaming off his skin noticeably The continual supply of Parshendi with gems in their braids had kept him fueled during the early part of the fight but the later ones had come to him without gemstones Another indication that they werent the simpleminded subhumans the lighteyes claimed they were Theyd seen what he was doing and even if they hadnt understood it theyd countered it He had enough Light to keep him from collapsing But as the Alethi pushed back the Parshendi Kaladin realized how timely their arrival had been I need to be very careful with this he thought The storm within made him thirst for motion and attack but using it drained his body The more of it he used and the faster he used it the worse it was when he ran out Alethi soldiers took up perimeter defense on both sides of the bridge and the exhausted bridgemen fell back many sitting down and holding wounds Kaladin hurried over to them Report Three dead Rock said grimly kneeling beside bodies hed laid out Malop Earless Jaks and Narm Kaladin frowned in sorrow Be glad the rest live he told himself It was easy to think Hard to accept How are the rest of you Five more had serious wounds but Rock and Lopen had seen to them Those two were learning quite well from Kaladins instruction There was little more Kaladin could do for the wounded He glanced at Malops body The man had taken an axe cut to the arm severing it and splintering the bone Hed died from blood loss If Kaladin hadnt been fighting he might have been able to No No regrets for the moment Pull back across he said to the bridgemen pointing Teft youre in command Moash you strong enough to stay with me Sure am Moash said a grin on his bloody face He looked excited not exhausted All three of the dead had been on his side but he and the others had fought remarkably well The other bridgemen retreated Kaladin turned to inspect the Alethi soldiers It was like looking into a triage tent Every man had a wound of some sort The ones at the center stumbled and limped Those at the outsides still fought their uniforms bloodied and torn The retreat had dissolved into chaos He made his way through the wounded waving for them to cross the bridge Some did as he said Others stood about looking dazed Kaladin rushed up to one group that seemed better off than most Whos in command here It The soldiers face had been cut across the cheek Brightlord Dalinar Immediate command Whos your captain Dead the man said And my companylord And his second Stormfather Kaladin thought Across the bridge with you he said then moved on I need an officer Whos in command of the retreat Ahead he could make out a figure in scratched blue Shardplate fighting at the front of group That would be Dalinars son Adolin He was busy holding the Parshendi off bothering him would not be wise Over here a man called Ive found Brightlord Havar Hes commander of the rear guard Finally Kaladin thought rushing through the chaos to find a bearded lighteyed man lying on the ground coughing blood Kaladin looked him over noting the enormous gut wound Whos his second Dead said the man beside the commander He was lighteyed And you are Kaladin asked Nacomb Gaval He looked young younger than Kaladin Youre promoted Kaladin said Get these men across the bridge as quickly as possible If anyone asks youve been given a field commission as commander of the rear guard If anyone claims to outrank you send them to me The man started Promoted Who are you Can you do that Someone needs to Kaladin snapped Go Get to work I Go Kaladin bellowed Remarkably the lighteyed man saluted him and began yelling for his squad Kholins men were wounded battered and dazed but they were well trained Once someone took command orders passed quickly Squads crossed the bridge falling into marching formations Likely in the confusion they clung to these familiar patterns Within minutes the central mass of Kholins army was flowing across the bridge like sand in an hourglass The ring of fighting contracted Still men screamed and died in the anarchic tumult of sword against shield and spear against metal Kaladin hurriedly pulled the carapace off his armorenraging the Parshendi didnt feel wise at the momentthen moved among the wounded looking for more officers He found a couple though they were dazed wounded and out of breath Apparently those who were still battleworthy were leading the two flanks who held back the Parshendi Trailed by Moash Kaladin hurried to the central front line where the Alethi seemed to be holding the best Here finally he found someone in command a tall stately lighteyes with a steel breastplate and matching helm his uniform a darker shade of blue than the others He directed the fighting from just behind the front lines The man nodded to Kaladin yelling to be heard over the sounds of battle You command the bridgemen I do Kaladin said Why arent your men moving across the bridge We are the Cobalt Guard the man said Our duty is to protect Brightlord Adolin The man pointed toward Adolin in his blue Shardplate just ahead The Shardbearer seemed to be pushing toward something Wheres the highprince Kaladin yelled Were not sure The man grimaced His guardsmen have vanished You have to pull back The bulk of the army is across If you remain here youll be surrounded We will not leave Brightlord Adolin Im sorry Kaladin looked around The groups of Alethi fighting at the flanks were barely holding their ground but they wouldnt fall back until ordered Fine Kaladin said raising his spear and pushing his way through to the front line Here the Parshendi fought with vigor Kaladin cut down one by the neck spinning into the middle of a group flashing out with his spear His Stormlight was nearly gone but these Parshendi had gemstones in their beards Kaladin breathed injust a little so as to not reveal himself to the Alethi soldiersand launched into a full attack The Parshendi fell back before his furious assault and the few members of the Cobalt Guard around him stumbled away looking stunned In seconds Kaladin had a dozen Parshendi on the ground around him wounded or dead That opened a gap and he tore through Moash on his heels A lot of the Parshendi were focused on Adolin whose blue Shardplate was scraped and cracked Kaladin had never seen a suit of Shardplate in such a terrible state Stormlight rose from those cracks in much the way it steamed from Kaladins skin when he heldor useda lot of it The fury of a Shardbearer at war gave Kaladin pause He and Moash stopped just outside of the mans fighting range and the Parshendi ignored the bridgemen trying with obvious desperation to take down the Shardbearer Adolin cut down through multiple men at oncebut as Kaladin had seen only once before his Blade did not slice flesh Parshendi eyes burned and blackened and dozens fell dead Adolin collecting corpses around him like ripened fruit falling from a tree And yet Adolin was obviously struggling His Shardplate was more than just crackedthere were holes in parts His helm was gone though hed replaced it with a regular spearmans cap His left leg limped nearly dragging That Blade of his was deadly but the Parshendi drew closer and closer Kaladin didnt dare step into range Adolin Kholin he bellowed The man kept fighting Adolin Kholin Kaladin yelled again feeling a little puff of Stormlight leave him his voice booming The Shardbearer paused then looked back at Kaladin Reluctantly the Shardbearer pulled back letting the Cobalt Guardusing the path opened by Kaladinrush forward and hold back the Parshendi Who are you Adolin demanded reaching Kaladin His proud youthful face was slick with sweat his hair a matted mess of blond mixed with black Im the man who saved your life Kaladin said I need you to order the retreat Your troops cant fight any longer My father is out there bridgeman Adolin said pointing with his overly large Blade I saw him just moments ago His Ryshadium went for him but neither horse nor man has returned Im going to lead a squad to You are going to retreat Kaladin said exasperated Look at your men Kholin They can barely keep their feet let alone fight Youre losing dozens by the minute You need to get them out I wont abandon my father Adolin said stubbornly For the peace of If you fall Adolin Kholin these men have nothing Their commanders are wounded or dead You cant go to your father you can barely walk I repeat get your men to safety The young Shardbearer stepped back blinking at Kaladins tone He looked northeastward toward where a figure in slate grey suddenly appeared on a rock outcropping fighting against another figure in Shardplate Hes so close Kaladin took a deep breath Ill go for him You lead the retreat Hold the bridge but only the bridge Adolin glared at Kaladin He took a step but something in his armor gave out and he stumbled going to one knee Teeth gritted he managed to rise Captainlord Malan Adolin bellowed Take your soldiers go with this man Get my father out The man Kaladin had spoken to earlier saluted crisply Adolin glared at Kaladin again then hefted his Shardblade and stalked with difficulty toward the bridge Moash go with him Kaladin said But Do it Moash Kaladin said grimly glancing toward the outcropping where Dalinar fought Kaladin took a deep breath tucked his spear under his arm and dashed off at a dead run The Cobalt Guard yelled at him trying to keep up but he didnt look back He hit the line of Parshendi attackers turned and tripped two with his spear then leaped over the bodies and kept going Most Parshendi in this patch were distracted by Dalinars fight or the battle to get to the bridge the ranks were thin here between the two fronts Kaladin moved quickly drawing in more Light as he ran dodging and scrambling around Parshendi who tried to engage him Within moments hed reached the place where Dalinar had been fighting Though the rock shelf was now empty a large group of Parshendi were gathered around its base There he thought leaping forward A horse whinnied Dalinar looked up in shock as Gallant charged into the open ring of ground the watching Parshendi had made The Ryshadium had come to him How where The horse should have been free and safe on the staging plateau It was too late Dalinar was on one knee beaten down by the enemy Shardbearer The Parshendi kicked smashing his foot into Dalinars chest throwing him backward A hit to the helm followed Another Another The helm exploded and the force of the hits left Dalinar dazed Where was he What was happening Why was he pinned by something so heavy Shardplate he thought struggling to rise Im wearing my Shardplate A breeze blew across his face Head blows you had to be careful of head blows even when wearing Plate His enemy stood over him looming and seemed to inspect him As if searching for something Dalinar had dropped his Blade The common Parshendi soldiers surrounded the duel They forced Gallant back making the horse whinny He reared Dalinar watched him vision swimming Why didnt the Shardbearer just finish him The Parshendi giant leaned down then spoke The words were thick with accent and Dalinars mind nearly dismissed them But here up close Dalinar realized something He understood what was being said The accent was nearly impenetrable but the words were in Alethi It is you the Parshendi Shardbearer said I have found you at last Dalinar blinked in surprise Something disturbed the back ranks of the watching Parshendi soldiers There was something familiar about this scene Parshendi all around Shardbearer in danger Dalinar had lived it before but from the other side That Shardbearer couldnt be talking to him Dalinar had been hit too hard on the head He must be delusional What was that disturbance in the ring of Parshendi watchers Sadeas Dalinar found himself thinking his mind confused Hes come to rescue me as I rescued him Unite them Hell come Dalinar thought I know he will I will gather them The Parshendi were yelling moving twisting Suddenly a figure exploded through them Not Sadeas at all A young man with a strong face and long curling black hair He carried a spear And he was glowing What Dalinar thought dazed Kaladin landed in the open circle The two Shardbearers were at the center one on the ground Stormlight trailing faintly from his body Too faintly Considering the number of cracks his gemstones must be almost spent The othera Parshendi judging by the size and shape of the limbswas standing over the fallen one Great Kaladin thought dashing forward before the Parshendi soldiers could collect their wits and attack him The Parshendi Shardbearer was bent down focused on Dalinar The Parshendis Plate was leaking Stormlight through a large fissure in the leg Somemory flashing back to the time he rescued AmaramKaladin got in close and slammed his spear into the crack The Shardbearer screamed and dropped his Blade in surprise It puffed to mist Kaladin whipped his spear free and dodged backward The Shardbearer swung toward him with a gauntleted fist but missed Kaladin jumped in andthrowing his full strength behind the blowrammed his spear into the cracked leg armor again The Shardbearer screamed even louder stumbling then fell to his knees Kaladin tried to pull his spear free but the man crumpled on top of it snapping the shaft Kaladin dodged back now facing a ring of Parshendi emptyhanded Stormlight streaming from his body Silence And then they began speaking again the words theyd said before Neshua Kadal They passed it among themselves whispering looking confused Then they began to chant a song hed never heard before Good enough Kaladin thought So long as they werent attacking him Dalinar Kholin was moving sitting up Kaladin knelt down commanding most of his Stormlight into the stony ground retaining just enough to keep him going but not enough to make him glow Then he hurried over to the armored horse at the side of the ring of Parshendi The Parshendi shied away from him looking terrified He took the reins and quickly returned to the highprince Dalinar shook his head trying to clear his mind His vision still swam but his thoughts were reforming What had happened Hed been hit on the head and and now the Shardbearer was down Down What had caused the Shardbearer to fall Had the creature really talked to him No he must have imagined that That and the young spearman glowing He wasnt doing so now Holding Gallants reins the young man waved at Dalinar urgently Dalinar forced himself to his feet Around them the Parshendi were muttering something unintelligible That Shardplate Dalinar thought looking at the kneeling Parshendi A Shardblade I could fulfill my promise to Renarin I could The Shardbearer groaned holding his leg with a gauntleted hand Dalinar itched to finish the kill He took a step forward dragging his unresponsive foot Around them the Parshendi troops watched silently Why didnt they attack The tall spearman ran up to Dalinar pulling Gallants reins On your horse lighteyes We should finish him We could On your horse the youth commanded tossing the reins at him as the Parshendi troops turned to engage a contingent of approaching Alethi soldiers Youre supposed to be an honorable one the spearman snarled Dalinar had rarely been spoken to in such a way particularly by a darkeyed man Well your men wont leave without you and my men wont leave without them So you will get on your horse and we will escape this deathtrap Do you understand Dalinar met the young mans eyes Then nodded Of course He was right they had to leave the enemy Shardbearer How would they get the armor out anyway Tow the corpse all the way Retreat Dalinar bellowed to his soldiers pulling himself into Gallants saddle He barely made it his armor had so little Stormlight left Steady loyal Gallant sprang into a gallop down the corridor of escape his men had bought for him with their blood The nameless spearman dashed behind him and the Cobalt Guard fell in around them A larger force of his troops was ahead on the escape plateau The bridge still stood Adolin waiting anxiously at its head holding it for Dalinars retreat With a rush of relief Dalinar galloped across the wooden deck reaching the adjoining plateau Adolin and last of his troops filed along behind him He turned Gallant looking eastward The Parshendi crowded up to the chasm but did not give chase A group of them worked on the chrysalis atop the plateau It had been forgotten by all sides in the fervor They had never followed before but if they changed their mind now they could harry Dalinars force all the way back to the permanent bridges But they didnt They formed ranks and began to chant another of their songs the same one they sang every time the Alethi forces retreated As Dalinar watched a figure in cracked silvery Shardplate and a red cape stumbled to their forefront The helm had been removed but it was too distant to make out any features on the black and red marbled skin Dalinars erstwhile foe raised his Shardblade in a motion that was unmistakable A salute a gesture of respect Instinctively Dalinar summoned his Blade and ten heartbeats later raised it to salute in return The bridgemen pulled the bridge across the chasm separating the armies Set up triage Dalinar bellowed We dont leave anyone behind who has a chance at living The Parshendi will not attack us here His men let out a shout Somehow escaping felt like more of a victory than any gemheart theyd won The tired Alethi troops divided into battalions Eight had marched to battle and they became eight againthough several had only a few hundred members remaining Those men trained for field surgery looked through the ranks while the remaining officers got survivor counts The men began to sit down among the painspren and exhaustionspren bloodied some weaponless many with torn uniforms On the other plateau the Parshendi continued their odd song Dalinar found himself focusing on the bridge crew The youth who had saved him was apparently their leader Had he fought down a Shardbearer Dalinar hazily remembered a quick sharp encounter a spear to the leg Clearly the young man was both skilled and lucky The bridgemans team acted with far more coordination and discipline than Dalinar would have expected of such lowly men He could wait no longer Dalinar nudged Gallant forward crossing the stones and passing wounded exhausted soldiers That reminded him of his own fatigue but now that he had a chance to sit he was recovering his head no longer ringing The leader of the bridge crew was seeing to a mans wound and his fingers worked with expertise A man trained in field medicine among bridgemen Well why not Dalinar thought Its no odder than their being able to fight so well Sadeas had been holding out on him The young man looked up And for the first time Dalinar noticed the slave brands on the youths forehead hidden by the long hair The youth stood posture hostile folding his arms You are to be commended Dalinar said All of you Why did your highprince retreat only to send you back for us Several of the bridgemen chuckled He didnt send us back their leader said We came on our own Against his wishes Dalinar found himself nodding and he realized that this was the only answer that made sense Why Dalinar asked Why come for us The youth shrugged You allowed yourself to get trapped in there quite spectacularly Dalinar nodded tiredly Perhaps he should have been annoyed at the young mans tone but it was only the truth Yes but why did you come And how did you learn to fight so well By accident the young man said He turned back to his wounded What can I do to repay you Dalinar asked The bridgeman looked back at him I dont know We were going to flee from Sadeas disappear in the confusion We might still but hell certainly hunt us down and kill us I could take your men to my camp make Sadeas free you from your bondage I worry that he wouldnt let us go the bridgeman said eyes haunted And I worry that your camp would offer no safety at all This move today by Sadeas It will mean war between you two will it not Would it Dalinar had avoided thinking of Sadeassurvival had taken his focusbut his anger at the man was a seething pit deep within He would exact revenge on Sadeas for this But could he allow war between the princedoms It would shatter Alethkar More than that it would destroy the Kholin house Dalinar didnt have the troops or the allies to stand against Sadeas not after this disaster How would Sadeas respond when Dalinar returned Would he try to finish the job attacking No Dalinar thought No he did it this way for a purpose Sadeas had not engaged him personally He had abandoned Dalinar but by Alethi standards that was another thing entirely He didnt want to risk the kingdom either Sadeas wouldnt want outright war and Dalinar couldnt afford outright war despite his seething anger He formed a fist turning to look at the spearman It will not turn to war Dalinar said Not yet at least Well if thats the case the spearman said then by taking us into your camp you commit robbery The kings law the Codes my men always claim you uphold would demand that you return us to Sadeas He wont let us go easily I will take care of Sadeas Dalinar said Return with me I vow that you will be safe I promise it with every shred of honor I have The young bridgeman met his eyes searching for something Such a hard man he was for one so young All right the spearman said Well return I cant leave my men back at camp andwith so many men now woundedwe dont have the proper supplies to run The young man turned back to his work and Dalinar rode Gallant in search of a casualty report He forced himself to contain his rage at Sadeas It was difficult No Dalinar could not let this turn to warbut neither could he let things go back to the way they had been Sadeas had upset the balance and it could never be regained Not in the same way All is withdrawn for me I stand against the one who saved my life I protect the one who killed my promises I raise my hand The storm responds Tanatanev 1173 18 seconds predeath A darkeyed mother of four in her sixtysecond year Navani pushed her way past the guards ignoring their protests and the calls of her attending ladies She forced herself to remain calm She would remain calm What she had heard was just rumor It had to be Unfortunately the older she grew the worse she became at maintaining a brightladys proper tranquility She hastened her step through Sadeass warcamp Soldiers raised hands toward her as she passed either to offer her aid or to demand she halt She ignored both theyd never dare lay a finger on her Being the kings mother gained one a few privileges The camp was messy and poorly laid out Pockets of merchants whores and workers made their homes in shanties built on the leeward sides of barracks Drippings of hardened crem hung from most leeward eaves like trails of wax left to pour over the side of a table It was a distinct contrast to the neat lines and scrubbed buildings of Dalinars warcamp He will be fine she told herself Hed better be fine It was a testament to her disordered state that she barely considered constructing a new street pattern for Sadeas in her head She made her way directly to the staging area and arrived to find an army that hardly looked as if it had been to battle Soldiers without any blood on their uniforms men chatting and laughing officers walking down lines and dismissing the men squad by squad That should have relieved her This didnt look like a force that had just suffered a disaster Instead it made her even more anxious Sadeas in unmarred red Shardplate was speaking with a group of officers in the shade of a nearby canopy She stalked up to the canopy but here a group of guards managed to bar her way forming up shoulder to shoulder while one went to inform Sadeas of her arrival Navani folded her arms impatiently Perhaps she should have taken a palanquin as her attending ladies had suggested Several of them looking beleaguered were just arriving at the staging area A palanquin would be faster in the long run they had explained as it would leave time for messengers to be sent so Sadeas could receive her Once she had obeyed such proprieties She could remember being a young woman playing the games expertly delighting in ways to manipulate the system What had that gotten her A dead husband whom shed never loved and a privileged position in court that amounted to being put out to pasture What would Sadeas do if she just started screaming The kings own mother bellowing like an axehound whose antenna had been twisted She considered it as the soldier waited for a chance to announce her to Sadeas From the corner of her eye she noticed a youth in a blue uniform arriving in the staging area accompanied by a small honor guard of three men It was Renarin for once bearing an expression other than calm curiosity Wideeyed and frantic he hurried up to Navani Mashala he pled in his quiet voice Please What have you heard Sadeass army returned without your fathers army Navani said There is talk of a rout though it doesnt look as if these men have been through one She glared at Sadeas giving serious contemplation to throwing a fit Fortunately he finally spoke with the soldier and then sent him back You may approach Brightness the man said bowing to her About time she growled shoving past and passing underneath the canopy Renarin joined her walking more hesitantly Brightness Navani Sadeas said clasping his hands behind his back imposing in his crimson Plate I had hoped to bring you the news at your sons palace I suppose that a disaster like this is too large to contain I express my condolences at the loss of your brother Renarin gasped softly Navani steeled herself folding her arms trying to quiet the screams of denial and pain that came from the back of her mind This was a pattern She often saw patterns in things In this case the pattern was that she could never possess anything of value for long It was always snatched from her just when it began to look promising Quiet she scolded herself You will explain she said to Sadeas meeting his gaze Shed practiced that look over the de cades and was pleased to see that it discomfited him Im sorry Brightness Sadeas repeated stammering The Parshendi overwhelmed your brothers army It was folly to work together Our change in tactics was so threatening to the savages that they brought every soldier they could to this battle surrounding us And so you left Dalinar We fought hard to reach him but the numbers were simply overpowering We had to retreat lest we lose ourselves as well I would have continued fighting save for the fact that I saw your brother fall with my own eyes swarmed by Parshendi with hammers He grimaced They began carrying away chunks of bloodied Shardplate as prizes Barbaric monsters Navani felt cold Cold numb How could this happen After finally finallymaking that stoneheaded man see her as a woman rather than as a sister And now And now She set her jaw against the tears I dont believe it I understand that the news is difficult Sadeas waved for an attendant to fetch her a chair I wish I had not been forced to bring it to you Dalinar and I well I have known him for many years and while we did not always see the same sunrise I considered him an ally And a friend He cursed softly looking eastward They will pay for this I will see that they pay He seemed so earnest that Navani found herself wavering Poor Renarin palefaced and wideeyed seemed stunned beyond the means to speak When the chair arrived Navani refused it so Renarin sat earning a glance of disapproval from Sadeas Renarin grasped his head in his hands staring at the ground He was trembling Hes highprince now Navani realized No No He was only highprince if she accepted the idea that Dalinar was dead And he wasnt He couldnt be Sadeas had all of the bridges she thought looking down at the lumberyard Navani stepped out into the lateafternoon sunlight feeling its heat on her skin She walked up to her attendants Brushpen she said to Makal who carried a satchel with Navanis possessions The thickest one And my burn ink The short plump woman opened the satchel taking out a long brushpen with a knob of hog bristles on the end as wide as a mans thumb Navani took it The ink followed Around her the guards stared as Navani took the pen and dipped it into the bloodcolored ink She knelt and began to paint on the stone ground Art was about creation That was its soul its essence Creation and order You took something disorganizeda splash of ink an empty pageand you built something from it Something from nothing The soul of creation She felt the tears on her cheeks as she painted Dalinar had no wife and no daughters he had nobody to pray for him And so Navani painted a prayer onto the stones themselves sending her attendants for more ink She paced off the size of the glyph as she continued its border making it enormous spreading her ink onto the tan rocks Soldiers gathered around Sadeas stepping from his canopy watching her paint her back to the sun as she crawled on the ground and furiously dipped her brushpen into the ink jars What was a prayer if not creation Making something where nothing existed Creating a wish out of despair a plea out of anguish Bowing ones back before the Almighty and forming humility from the empty pride of a human life Something from nothing True creation Her tears mixed with the ink She went through four jars She crawled holding her safehand to the ground brushing the stones and smearing ink on her cheeks when she wiped the tears When she finally finished she knelt back on her knees before a glyph twenty paces long emblazoned as if in blood The wet ink reflected sunlight and she fired it with a candle the ink was made to burn whether wet or dry The flames burned across the length of the prayer killing it and sending its soul to the Almighty She bowed her head before the prayer It was only a single character but a complex one Thath Justice Men watched quietly as if afraid of spoiling her solemn wish A cold breeze began blowing whipping at pennants and cloaks The prayer went out but that was fine It wasnt meant to burn long Brightlord Sadeas an anxious voice called Navani looked up Soldiers parted making way for a runner in green He hurried up to Sadeas beginning to speak but the highprince grabbed the man by the shoulder in a Shardplate grip and pointed gesturing for his guards to make a perimeter He pulled the messenger beneath the canopy Navani continued to kneel beside her prayer The flames left a black scar in the shape of the glyph on the ground Someone stepped up beside her Renarin He went to one knee resting a hand on her shoulder Thank you Mashala She nodded standing her freehand sprinkled with drops of red pigment Her cheeks were still wet with tears but she narrowed her eyes looking through the press of soldiers toward Sadeas His expression was thunderous face growing red eyes wide with anger She turned and pushed her way through the press of soldiers scrambling up to the rim of the staging field Renarin and some of Sadeass officers joined her in staring out over the Shattered Plains And there they saw a creeping line of men limping back toward the warcamps led by a mounted man in slategrey armor Dalinar rode Gallant at the head of two thousand six hundred and fiftythree men That was all that remained of his assault force of eight thousand The long trek back across the plateaus had given him time to think His insides were still a tempest of emotions He flexed his left hand as he rode it was now encased by a bluepainted Shardplate gauntlet borrowed from Adolin It would take days to regrow Dalinars own gauntlet Longer if the Parshendi tried to grow a full suit from the one he had left They would fail so long as Dalinars armorers fed Stormlight to his suit The abandoned gauntlet would degrade and crumble to dust a new one growing for Dalinar For now he wore Adolins They had collected all of the infused gemstones among his twentysix hundred men and used that Stormlight to recharge and reinforce his armor It was still scarred with cracks Healing as much damage as it had sustained would take days but the Plate was in fighting shape again if it came to that He needed to make certain it didnt He intended to confront Sadeas and he wanted to be armored when he did In fact he wanted to storm up the incline to Sadeass warcamp and declare formal war on his old friend Perhaps summon his Blade and see Sadeas dead But he wouldnt His soldiers were too weak his position too tenuous Formal war would destroy him and the kingdom He had to do something else Something that protected the kingdom Revenge would come Eventually Alethkar came first He lowered his bluegauntleted fist gripping Gallants reins Adolin rode a short distance away Theyd repaired his armor as well though he now lacked a gauntlet Dalinar had refused the gift of his sons gauntlet at first but had given in to Adolins logic If one of them was going to go without it should be the younger man Inside Shardplate their differences in age didnt matterbut outside of it Adolin was a young man in his twenties and Dalinar an aging man in his fifties He still didnt know what to think of the visions and their apparent failure in telling him to trust Sadeas Hed confront that later One step at a time Elthal Dalinar called The highestranked officer who had survived the disaster Elthal was a limber man with a distinguished face and a thin mustache His arm was in a sling Hed been one of those to hold the gap alongside Dalinar during the last part of the fight Yes Brightlord Elthal asked jogging over to Dalinar All of the horses save the two Ryshadium were carrying wounded Take the wounded to my warcamp Dalinar said Then tell Teleb to bring the entire camp to alert Mobilize the remaining companies Yes Brightlord the man said saluting Brightlord what should I tell them to prepare for Anything But hopefully nothing I understand Brightlord Elthal said leaving to follow the orders Dalinar turned Gallant to march over to the group of bridgemen still following their somber leader a man named Kaladin Theyd left their bridge as soon as theyd reached the permanent bridges Sadeas could send for it eventually The bridgemen stopped as he approached looking as tired as he felt then arranged themselves in a subtly hostile formation They clung to their spears as if certain hed try to take them away They had saved him yet they obviously didnt trust him Im sending my wounded back to my camp Dalinar said You should go with them Youre confronting Sadeas Kaladin asked I must I have to know why he did what he did I will buy your freedom when I do Then Im staying with you Kaladin said Me too said a hawkfaced man at the side Soon all of the bridgemen were demanding to stay Kaladin turned to them I should send you back What asked an older bridgeman with a short grey beard You can risk yourself but we cant We have men back in Sadeass camp We need to get them out At the very least we need to stay together See this through The others nodded Again Dalinar was struck by their discipline More and more he was certain Sadeas had nothing to do with that It was this man at their head Though his eyes were dark brown he held himself like a brightlord Well if they wouldnt go Dalinar wouldnt force them He continued to ride and soon close to a thousand of Dalinars soldiers broke off and marched south toward his warcamp The rest of them continued toward Sadeass camp As they drew closer Dalinar noticed a small crowd gathering at the final chasm Two figures in particular stood at their forefront Renarin and Navani What are they doing in Sadeass warcamp Adolin asked smiling through his fatigue edging Sureblood up beside Dalinar I dont know Dalinar said But the Stormfather bless them for coming Seeing their welcome faces he began to feel it sink infinallythat he had survived the day Gallant crossed the last bridge Renarin was there waiting and Dalinar rejoiced For once the boy was displaying outright joy Dalinar swung free from the saddle and embraced his son Father Renarin said you live Adolin laughed swinging out of his own saddle armor clanking Renarin pulled out of the embrace and grabbed Adolin on the shoulder pounding the Shardplate lightly with his other hand grinning widely Dalinar smiled as well turning from the brothers to look at Navani She stood with hands clasped before her one eyebrow raised Her face oddly bore a few small smears of red paint You werent even worried were you he said to her Worried she asked Her eyes met his and for the first time he noticed their redness I was terrified And then Dalinar found himself grabbing her in an embrace He had to be careful as he was in Shardplate but the gauntlets let him feel the silk of her dress and his missing helm let him smell the sweet floral scent of her perfumed soap He held her as tightly as he dared bowing his head and pressing his nose into her hair Hmm she noted warmly it appears that I was missed The others are watching Theyll talk I dont care Hmm It appears I was very much missed On the battlefield he said gruffly I thought I would die And I realized it was all right She pulled her head back looking confused I have spent too much of my time worrying about what people think Navani When I thought my time had arrived I realized that all my worrying had been wasted In the end I was pleased with how I had lived my life He looked down at her then mentally unlatched his right gauntlet letting it drop to the ground with a clank He reached up with that callused hand cupping her chin I had only two regrets One for you and one for Renarin So youre saying you can just die and it would be all right No he said What Im saying is that I faced eternity and I saw peace there That will change how I live Without all of the guilt He hesitated Being me I doubt Ill banish it entirely The end was peace but living that is a tempest Still I see things differently now It is time to stop letting myself be shoved around by lying men He looked up toward the ridge above where more soldiers in green were gathering I keep thinking of one of the visions he said softly the latest one where I met Nohadon He rejected my suggestion that he write down his wisdom Theres something there Something I need to learn What Navani asked I dont know yet But Im close to figuring it out He held her close again hand on the back of her head feeling her hair He wished for the Plate to be gone to not be separated from her by the metal But the time for that had not yet come Reluctantly he released her turning to the side where Renarin and Adolin were watching them uncomfortably His soldiers were looking up at Sadeass army gathering on the ridge I cant let this come to bloodshed Dalinar thought reaching down and putting his hand into the fallen gauntlet The straps tightened connecting to the rest of the armor But Im also not going to slink back to my camp without confronting him He at least had to know the purpose of the betrayal All had been going so well Besides there was the matter of his promise to the bridgemen Dalinar walked up the slope bloodstained blue cloak flapping behind him Adolin clanked up next to him on one side Navani keeping pace on the other Renarin followed Dalinars remaining sixteen hundred troops marching up as well Father Adolin said looking at the hostile troops Dont summon your Blade This will not come to blows Sadeas abandoned you didnt he Navani asked quietly eyes alight with anger He didnt just abandon us Adolin spat He set us up then betrayed us We survived Dalinar said firmly The way ahead was becoming clearer He knew what he needed to do He wont attack us here but he might try to provoke us Keep your sword as mist Adolin and dont let our troops make any mistakes The soldiers in green parted reluctantly holding spears Hostile To the side Kaladin and his bridgemen walked near the front of Dalinars force Adolin didnt summon his Blade though he regarded Sadeass troops around them with contempt Dalinars soldiers couldnt have felt easy about being surrounded by enemies once again but they followed him onto the staging field Sadeas stood ahead The treacherous highprince waited with arms folded still wearing his Shardplate curly black hair blowing in the breeze Someone had burned an enormous thath glyph on the stones here and Sadeas stood at its center Justice There was something magnificently appropriate about Sadeas standing there treading upon justice Dalinar Sadeas exclaimed old friend It appears that I overestimated the odds against you I apologize for retreating when you were still in danger but the safety of my men came first Im certain you understand Dalinar stopped a short distance from Sadeas The two faced each other collected armies tense A cold breeze whipped at a canopy behind Sadeas Of course Dalinar said his voice even You did what you had to do Sadeas relaxed visibly though several of Dalinars soldiers muttered at that Adolin silenced them with pointed glances Dalinar turned waving Adolin and his men backward Navani gave him a raised eyebrow but retreated with the others when he urged her Dalinar looked back at Sadeas and the manlooking curiouswaved his own attendants back Dalinar walked up to the edge of the thath glyph and Sadeas stepped forward until only inches separated them They were matched in height Standing this close Dalinar thought he could see tensionand angerin Sadeass eyes Dalinars survival had ruined months of planning I need to know why Dalinar asked too quietly for any but Sadeas to hear Because of my oath old friend What Dalinar asked hands forming fists We swore something together years ago Sadeas sighed losing his flippancy and speaking openly Protect Elhokar Protect this kingdom Thats what I was doing We had the same purpose And we were fighting together Sadeas It was working Yes Sadeas said But Im confident I can beat the Parshendi on my own now Everything weve done together I can manage by splitting my army into twoone to race on ahead a larger force to follow I had to take this chance to remove you Dalinar cant you see Gavilar died because of his weakness I wanted to attack the Parshendi from the start conquer them He insisted on a treaty which led to his death Now youre starting to act just like him Those same ideas the same ways of speaking Through you they begin to infect Elhokar He dresses like you He talks of the Codes to me and of how perhaps we should enforce them through all the warcamps Hes beginning to think of retreating And so youd have me think this an act of honor Dalinar growled Not at all Sadeas said chuckling I have struggled for years to become Elhokars most trusted advisorbut there was always you distracting him holding his ear despite my every eff ort I wont pretend this was only about honor though there was an element of that to it In the end I just wanted you gone Sadeass voice grew cold But you are going insane old friend You may name me a liar but I did what I did today as a mercy A way of letting you die in glory rather than watching you descend further and further By letting the Parshendi kill you I could protect Elhokar from you and turn you into a symbol to remind the others what were really doing here Your death might have become what finally united us Ironic if you consider it Dalinar breathed in and out It was hard not to let his anger his indignation consume him Then tell me one thing Why not pin the assassination attempt on me Why clear me if you were only looking to betray me later on Sadeas snorted softly Bah Nobody would really believe that you tried to kill the king Theyd gossip but they wouldnt believe it Blaming you too quickly would have risked implicating myself He shook his head I think Elhokar knows who tried to kill him Hes admitted as much to me though he wont give me the name What Dalinar thought He knows But how Why not tell us who Dalinar adjusted his plans He wasnt certain if Sadeas was telling the truth but if he was he could use this He knows it wasnt you Sadeas continued I can read that much in him though he doesnt realize how transparent he is Blaming you would have been pointless Elhokar would have defended you and I might very well have lost the position of Highprince of Information But it did give me a wonderful opportunity to make you trust me again Unite them The visions But the man who spoke to Dalinar in them had been dead wrong Acting with honor hadnt won Sadeass loyalty It had just opened Dalinar up to betrayal If it means anything Sadeas said idly Im fond of you I really am But you are a boulder in my path and a force workingagainst its own knowledge to destroy Gavilars kingdom When the chance came along I took it It wasnt simply a convenient opportunity Dalinar said You set this up Sadeas I planned but Im often planning I dont always act on my options Today I did Dalinar snorted Well youve shown me something today Sadeas shown it to me by the very act of trying to remove me And what was that Sadeas asked amused Youve shown me that Im still a threat The highprinces continued their lowpitched conversation Kaladin stood to the side of Dalinars soldiers exhausted with the members of Bridge Four Sadeas spared a glance for them Matal stood in the crowd and had been watching Kaladins team the entire time redfaced Matal probably knew that he would be punished as Lamaril had been They should have learned They should have killed Kaladin at the start They tried he thought They failed He didnt know what had happened to him what had gone on with Syl and the words in his head It seemed that Stormlight worked better for him now It had been more potent more powerful But now it was gone and he was so tired Drained Hed pushed himself and Bridge Four too far Too hard Perhaps he and the others should have gone to Kholins camp But Teft was right they needed to see this through He promised Kaladin thought He promised he would free us from Sadeas And yet where had the promises of lighteyes gotten him in the past The highprinces broke off their conference separating stepping back from one another Well Sadeas said loudly your men are obviously tired Dalinar We can speak later about what went wrong though I think it is safe to assume that our alliance has proven unfeasible Unfeasible Dalinar said A kind way of putting it He nodded toward the bridgemen I will take these bridgemen with me to my camp Im afraid I can not part with them Kaladins heart sank Surely they arent worth much to you Dalinar said Name your price Im not looking to sell I will pay sixty emerald broams per man Dalinar said That drew gasps from the watching soldiers on both sides It was easily twenty times the price of a good slave Not for a thousand each Dalinar Sadeas said Kaladin could see the deaths of his bridgemen in those eyes Take your soldiers and go Leave my property here Do not press me on this Sadeas Dalinar said Suddenly the tension was back Dalinars officers lowered hands to swords and his spearmen perked up gripping the hafts of their weapons Do not press you Sadeas asked What kind of threat is that Leave my camp Its obvious that there is nothing more between us If you try to steal my property I will have every justification in attacking you Dalinar stood in place He looked confident though Kaladin saw no reason why And another promise dies Kaladin thought turning away In the end for all his good intentions this Dalinar Kholin was the same as the others Behind Kaladin men gasped in surprise Kaladin froze then spun around Dalinar Kholin had summoned his massive Shardblade it dripped beads of water from having just been summoned His armor steamed faintly Stormlight rising from the cracks Sadeas stumbled back eyes wide His honor guard drew their swords Adolin Kholin reached his hand to the side apparently beginning to summon his own weapon Dalinar took one step forward then drove his Blade pointfirst into the middle of the blackened glyph on the stone He took a step back For the bridgemen he said Sadeas blinked Muttering voices fell silent and the people on the field seemed too stunned even to breathe What Sadeas asked The Blade Dalinar said firm voice carrying in the air In exchange for your bridgemen All of them Every one you have in camp They become mine to do with as I please never to be touched by you again In exchange you get the sword Sadeas looked down at the Blade incredulous This weapon is worth fortunes Cities palaces kingdoms Do we have a deal Dalinar asked Father no Adolin Kholin said his own Blade appearing in his hand You Dalinar raised a hand silencing the younger man He kept his eyes on Sadeas Do we have a deal he asked each word sharp Kaladin stared unable to move unable to think Sadeas looked at the Shardblade eyes full of lust He glanced at Kaladin hesitated just briefly then reached and grabbed the Blade by the hilt Take the storming creatures Dalinar nodded curtly turning away from Sadeas Lets go he said to his entourage Theyre worthless you know Sadeas said Youre of the ten fools Dalinar Kholin Dont you see how mad you are This will be remembered as the most ridiculous decision ever made by an Alethi highprince Dalinar didnt look back He walked up to Kaladin and the other members of Bridge Four Go Dalinar said to them voice kindly Gather your things and the men you left behind I will send troops with you to act as guards Leave the bridges and come swiftly to my camp You will be safe there You have my word of honor on it He began to walk away Kaladin shook off his numbness He scrambled after the highprince grabbing his armored arm Wait You That What just happened Dalinar turned to him Then the highprince laid a hand on Kaladins shoulder the gauntlet gleaming blue mismatched with the rest of his slategrey armor I dont know what has been done to you I can only guess what your life has been like But know this You will not be bridgemen in my camp nor will you be slaves But What is a mans life worth Dalinar asked softly The slavemasters say one is worth about two emerald broams Kaladin said frowning And what do you say A life is priceless he said immediately quoting his father Dalinar smiled wrinkle lines extending from the corners of his eyes Coincidentally that is the exact value of a Shardblade So today you and your men sacrificed to buy me twentysix hundred priceless lives And all I had to repay you with was a single priceless sword I call that a bargain You really think it was a good trade dont you Kaladin said amazed Dalinar smiled in a way that seemed strikingly paternal For my honor Unquestionably Go and lead your men to safety soldier Later tonight I will have some questions for you Kaladin glanced at Sadeas who held his new Blade with awe You said youd take care of Sadeas This was what you intended This wasnt taking care of Sadeas Dalinar said This was taking care of you and your men I still have work to do today Dalinar found King Elhokar in his palace sitting room Dalinar nodded once more to the guards outside then closed the door They seemed troubled As well they should his orders had been irregular But they would do as told They wore the kings colors blue and gold but they were Dalinars men chosen specifically for their loyalty The door shut with a snap The king was staring at one of his maps wearing his Shardplate Ah Uncle he said turning to Dalinar Good I had wanted to speak with you Do you know of these rumors about you and my mother I realize that nothing untoward could be happening but I do worry about what people think Dalinar crossed the room booted feet thumping on the rich rug Infused diamonds hung in the corners of the room and the carved walls had been set with tiny chips of quartz to sparkle and reflect the light Honestly Uncle Elhokar said shaking his head Im growing very intolerant of your reputation in camp What they are saying reflects poorly on me you see and He trailed off as Dalinar stopped about a pace from him Uncle Is everything all right My door guards reported some kind of mishap with your plateau assault today but my mind was full of thoughts Did I miss anything vital Yes Dalinar said Then he raised his leg and kicked the king in the chest The strength of the blow tossed the king backward against his desk The fine wood shattered as the heavy Shardbearer crashed through it Elhokar hit the floor his breastplate cracked just faintly Dalinar stepped up to him then delivered another kick to the kings side cracking the breastplate again Elhokar began shouting in panic Guards To me Guards Nobody came Dalinar kicked again and Elhokar cursed catching his boot Dalinar grunted but bent down and grabbed Elhokar by the arm then yanked him to his feet tossing him toward the side of the room The king stumbled on the rug crashing through a chair Round lengths of wood scattered splinters spraying out Wideeyed Elhokar scrambled to his feet Dalinar advanced on him What has gone wrong with you Uncle Elhokar yelled Youre mad Guards Assassin in the kings chamber Guards Elhokar tried to run for the door but Dalinar threw his shoulder against the king tossing the younger man to the ground again Elhokar rolled but got a hand under himself and climbed to his knees the other hand to the side A puff of mist appeared in it as he summoned his Blade Dalinar kicked the kings hand just as the Shardblade dropped into it The blow knocked the Blade free and it dissolved back to mist immediately Elhokar frantically swung a fist at Dalinar but Dalinar caught it then reached down and hauled the king to his feet He pulled Elhokar forward and slammed his fist into the kings breastplate Elhokar struggled but Dalinar repeated the move smashing his gauntlet against the Plate cracking the steel casings around his fingers making the king grunt The next blow shattered Elhokars breastplate in an explosion of molten shards Dalinar dropped the king to the floor Elhokar struggled to rise again but the breastplate was a focus for the Shardplates power Missing it left arms and legs heavy He went to one knee beside the squirming king Elhokars Shardblade formed again but Dalinar grabbed the kings wrist and smashed it against the stone floor knocking the Blade free yet again It vanished into mist Guards Elhokar squealed Guards guards guards They wont come Elhokar Dalinar said softly Theyre my men and I left them with orders not to enteror let anyone else enterno matter what they heard Even if that included pleas for help from you Elhokar fell silent They are my men Elhokar Dalinar repeated I trained them I placed them there Theyve always been loyal to me Why Uncle What are you doing Please tell me He was nearly weeping Dalinar leaned down getting close enough to smell the kings breath The girth on your horse during the hunt Dalinar said quietly You cut it yourself didnt you Elhokars eyes grew wider The saddles were switched before you came to my camp Dalinar said You did that because you didnt want to ruin your favorite saddle when it flew free of the horse You were planning for it to happen you made it happen Thats why youve been so certain that the girth was cut Cringing Elhokar nodded Someone was trying to kill me but you wouldnt believe I I worried it might be you So I decided I You cut your own strap Dalinar said to create a visible obviousseeming attempt on your life Something that would get me or Sadeas to investigate Elhokar hesitated then nodded again Dalinar closed his eyes breathing out slowly Dont you realize what you did Elhokar You brought suspicion on me from across the camps You gave Sadeas an opportunity to destroy me He opened his eyes looking down at the king I had to know Elhokar whispered I couldnt trust anyone He groaned beneath Dalinars weight What of the cracked gemstones in your Shardplate Did you place those too No Then maybe you did uncover something Dalinar said with a grunt I guess you cant be completely blamed Then youll let me up No Dalinar leaned down farther He laid a hand against the kings chest Elhokar stopped struggling looking up in terror If I push Dalinar said you die Your ribs crack like twigs your heart is smashed like a grape Nobody would blame me They all whisper that the Blackthorn should have taken the throne for himself years ago Your guard is loyal to me There would be nobody to avenge you Nobody would care Elhokar breathed out as Dalinar pressed his hand down just slightly Do you understand Dalinar asked quietly No Dalinar sighed then released the younger man and stood up Elhokar inhaled with a gasp Your paranoia may be unfounded Dalinar said or it may be well founded Either way you need to understand something I am not your enemy Elhokar frowned So youre not going to kill me Storms no I love you like a son boy Elhokar rubbed his chest You have very odd paternal instincts I spent years following you Dalinar said I gave you my loyalty my devotion and my counsel I swore myself to youpromising myself vowing to myself that I would never covet Gavilars throne All to keep my heart loyal Despite this you dont trust me You pull a stunt like that one with the girth implicating me giving your own enemies position against you without knowing it Dalinar stepped toward the king Elhokar cringed Well now you know Dalinar said voice hard If Id wanted to kill you Elhokar I could have done it a dozen times over A hundred times over It appears you wont accept loyalty and devotion as proof of my honesty Well if you act like a child you get treated like one You know now for a fact that I dont want you dead For if I did I would have crushed your chest and been done with it He locked eyes with the king Now Dalinar said do you understand Slowly Elhokar nodded Good Dalinar said Tomorrow youre going to name me Highprince of War What Sadeas betrayed me today Dalinar said He walked over to the broken desk kicking at the pieces The kings seal rolled out of its customary drawer He picked it up Nearly six thousand of my men were slaughtered Adolin and I barely survived What Elhokar said forcing himself up to a sitting position Thats impossible Far from it Dalinar said looking at his nephew He saw a chance to pull out letting the Parshendi destroy us So he did it A very Alethi thing to do Ruthless yet still allowing him to feign a sense of honor or morality So you expect me to bring him to trial No Sadeas is no worse and no better than the others Any of the highprinces would betray their fellows if they saw a chance to do it without risking themselves I intend to find a way to unite them in more than just name Somehow Tomorrow once you name me Highprince of War I will give my Plate to Renarin to fulfill a promise Ive already given away my Blade to fulfill a different one He walked closer meeting Elhokars eyes again then gripped the kings seal in his hand As Highprince of War I will enforce the Codes in all ten camps Then Ill coordinate the war eff ort directly determining which armies get to go on which plateau assaults All gemhearts will be won by the Throne then distributed as spoils by you Well change this from a competition to a real war and Ill use it to turn these ten armies of ours and their leadersinto real soldiers Stormfather Theyll kill us The highprinces will revolt I wont last a week They wont be pleased thats for certain Dalinar said And yes this will involve a great deal of danger Well have to be much more careful with our guard If youre right someone is already trying to kill you so we should be doing that anyway Elhokar stared at him then looked at the broken furniture rubbing his chest Youre serious arent you Yes He tossed the seal to Elhokar Youre going to have your scribes draw up my appointment right after I leave But I thought you said it was wrong to force men to follow the Codes Elhokar said You said that the best way to change people was to live right and then let them be influenced by your example That was before the Almighty lied to me Dalinar said He still didnt know what to think of that Much of what I told you I learned from The Way of Kings But I didnt understand something Nohadon wrote the book at the end of his life after creating orderafter forcing the kingdoms to unite after rebuilding lands that had fallen in the Desolation The book was written to embody an ideal It was given to people who already had momentum in doing what was right That was my mistake Before any of this can work our people need to have a minimum level of honor and dignity Adolin said something to me a few weeks back something profound He asked me why I forced my sons to live up to such high expectations but let others go about their errant ways without condemnation I have been treating the other highprinces and their lighteyes like adults An adult can take a principle and adapt it to his needs But were not ready for that yet Were children And when youre teaching a child you require him to do what is right until he grows old enough to make his own choices The Silver Kingdoms didnt begin as unified glorious bastions of honor They were trained that way raised up like youths nurtured to maturity He strode forward kneeling down beside Elhokar The king continued to rub his chest his Shardplate looking strange with the central piece missing Were going to make something of Alethkar nephew Dalinar said softly The highprinces gave their oaths to Gavilar but now ignore those oaths Well its time to stop letting them Were going to win this war and were going to turn Alethkar into a place that men will envy again Not because of our military prowess but because people here are safe and because justice reigns Were going to do itor you and I are going to die in the attempt You say that with eagerness Because I finally know exactly what to do Dalinar said standing up straight I was trying to be Nohadon the peacemaker But Im not Im the Blackthorn a general and a warlord I have no talent for backroom politicking but I am very good at training troops Starting tomorrow every man in each of these camps will be mine As far as Im concerned theyre all raw recruits Even the highprinces Assuming I make the proclamation You will Dalinar said And in return I promise to find out who is trying to kill you Elhokar snorted beginning to remove his Shardplate piece by piece After that announcement goes out discovering whos trying to kill me will become easy You can put every name in the warcamps on the list Dalinars smile widened At least we wont have to guess then Dont be so glum nephew You learned something today Your uncle doesnt want to kill you He just wants to make me a target For your own good son Dalinar said walking to the door Dont fret too much Ive got some plans on how exactly to keep you alive He opened the door revealing a nervous group of guards keeping at bay a nervous group of servants and attendants Hes just fine Dalinar said to them See He stepped aside letting the guards and servants in to attend their king Dalinar turned to go Then he hesitated Oh and Elhokar Your mother and I are now courting Youll want to start growing accustomed to that Despite everything else that had happened in the last few minutes this got a look of pure astonishment from the king Dalinar smiled and pulled the door closed walking away with a firm step Most everything was still wrong He was still furious at Sadeas pained by the loss of so many of his men confused at what to do with Navani dumbfounded by his visions and daunted by the idea of bringing the warcamps to unity But at least now he had something to work with Shallan lay quietly in the bed of her little hospital room Shed cried herself dry then had actually retched into the bedpan over what she had done She felt miserable Shed betrayed Jasnah And Jasnah knew Somehow disappointing the princess felt worse than the theft itself This entire plan had been foolish from the start Beyond that Kabsal was dead Why did she feel so sick about that Hed been an assassin trying to kill Jasnah willing to risk Shallans life to achieve his goals And yet she missed him Jasnah hadnt seemed surprised that someone would want to kill her perhaps assassins were a common part of her life She likely thought Kabsal a hardened killer but hed been sweet with Shallan Could that all really have been a lie He had to be somewhat sincere she told herself curled up on her bed If he didnt care for me why did he work so hard to get me to take the jam He had handed Shallan the antidote first rather than taking it himself And yet he did take it eventually she thought He put that fingerful of jam into his mouth Why didnt the antidote save him This question began to haunt her As it did something else struck her something she would have noticed earlier had she not been distracted by her own betrayal Jasnah had eaten the bread Arms wrapped around herself Shallan sat up pulling back to the beds headboard She ate it but she wasnt poisoned she thought My life makes no sense lately The creatures with the twisted heads the place with the dark sky the Soulcasting and now this How had Jasnah survived How With trembling fingers Shallan reached to the pouch on the stand beside her bed Inside she found the garnet sphere that Jasnah had used to save her It gave off weak light most had been used in the Soulcasting It was enough light to illuminate her sketchpad sitting beside the bed Jasnah probably hadnt even bothered to look through it She was so dismissive of the visual arts Next to the sketchpad was the book Jasnah had given her The Book of Endless Pages Why had she left that Shallan picked up the charcoal pencil and flipped through to a blank page in her sketchbook She passed several pictures of the symbolheaded creatures some set in this very room They lurked around her always At some times she thought she saw them in the corners of her eyes At others she could hear them whispering She hadnt dared speak back to them again She began to draw fingers unsteady sketching Jasnah on that day in the hospital Sitting beside Shallans bed holding the jam Shallan hadnt taken a distinct Memory and wasnt as accurate as if she had but she remembered well enough to draw Jasnah with her finger stuck into the jam She had raised that finger to smell the strawberries Why Why put her finger into the jam Wouldnt raising the jar to her nose have been enough Jasnah hadnt made any faces at the scent In fact Jasnah hadnt mentioned that the jam had spoiled Shed just replaced the lid and handed back the jar Shallan flipped to another blank page and drew Jasnah with a piece of bread raised to her lips After eating it shed grimaced Odd Shallan lowered her pen looking at that sketch of Jasnah piece of bread pinched between her fingers It wasnt a perfect reproduction but it was close enough In the sketch it looked like the piece of bread was melting As if it were squished unnaturally between Jasnahs fingers as she put it into her mouth Could it could it be Shallan slid out of the bed gathering the sphere and carrying it in her hand sketchpad tucked under her arm The guard was gone Nobody seemed to care what happened to her she was being shipped off in the morning anyway The stone floor was cold beneath her bare feet She wore only the white robe and felt almost naked At least her safehand was covered There was a door to the city outside at the end of the hallway and she stepped through it She crossed quietly through the city making her way to the Ralinsa avoiding dark alleyways She walked up toward the Conclave long red hair blowing free behind her drawing more than a few strange looks and stares It was so late at night that nobody on the roadway cared enough to ask if she wanted help The masterservants at the entrance to the Conclave let her pass They recognized her and more than a few asked if she needed help She declined walking alone down to the Veil She passed inside then looked up at the walls full of balconies some of them lit with spheres Jasnahs alcove was occupied Of course it was Always working Jasnah was Shed be particularly bothered by having lost so much time over Shallans presumed suicide attempt The lift felt rickety beneath Shallans feet as the parshmen lifted her up to Jasnahs level She rode in silence feeling disconnected from the world around her Walking around through the palacethrough the cityin only a robe Confronting Jasnah Kholin again Hadnt she learned But what did she have to lose She walked down the familiar stone hallway to the alcove weak blue sphere held before her Jasnah sat at her desk Her eyes looked uncharacteristically fatigued dark circles underneath her face stressed She looked up and stiffened as she saw Shallan You are not welcome here Shallan walked in anyway surprised by how calm she felt Her hands should be shaking Dont make me call the soldiers to get rid of you Jasnah said I could have you thrown in prison for a hundred years for what you did Do you have any idea what The Soulcaster you wear is a fake Shallan said quietly It was a fake the whole time even before I made the swap Jasnah froze I wondered why you didnt notice the switch Shallan said sitting in the rooms other chair I spent weeks confused Had you noticed but decided to keep quiet in order to catch the thief Hadnt you Soulcast in all that time It didnt make any sense Unless the Soulcaster I stole was a decoy Jasnah relaxed Yes Very clever of you to realize that I keep several decoys Youre not the first to try to steal the fabrial you see I keep the real one carefully hidden of course Shallan took out her sketchpad and searched through for a specific picture It was the image shed drawn of the strange place with the sea of beads the floating flames the distant sun in a black black sky Shallan regarded it for a moment Then she turned it and held it up for Jasnah The look of utter shock Jasnah displayed was nearly worth the night spent feeling sick and guilty Jasnahs eyes bulged and she sputtered for a moment trying to find words Shallan blinked taking a Memory of that She couldnt help herself Where did you find that Jasnah demanded What book described that scene to you No book Jasnah Shallan said lowering the picture I visited that place The night when I accidentally Soulcast the goblet in my room to blood then covered it up by faking a suicide attempt Impossible You think Id believe There is no fabrial is there Jasnah Theres no Soulcaster There never has been You use the fake fabrial to distract people from the fact that you have the power to Soulcast on your own Jasnah fell silent I did it too Shallan said The Soulcaster was tucked away in my safepouch I wasnt touching itbut that didnt matter It was a fake What I did I did without it Perhaps being near you has changed me somehow It has something to do with that place and those creatures Again no reply You suspected Kabsal of being an assassin Shallan said You knew immediately what had happened when I fell you were expecting poison or at least were aware that it was possible But you thought the poison was in the jam You Soulcast it when you opened the lid and pretended to smell it You didnt know how to recreate strawberry jam and when you tried you made that vile concoction You thought to get rid of poison But you inadvertently Soulcast away the antidote You didnt want to eat the bread either just in case there was something in it You always refused it When I convinced you to take a bite you Soulcast it into something else as you put it in your mouth You said youre terrible at making organic things and what you created was revolting But you got rid of the poison which is why you didnt succumb to it Shallan met her former mistresss eyes Was it the fatigue that made her so indifferent to the consequences of confronting this woman Or was it her knowledge of the truth You did all that Jasnah Shallan finished with a fake Soulcaster You hadnt spotted my swap yet Dont try to tell me otherwise I took it on the night when you killed those three thugs Jasnahs violet eyes showed a glimmer of surprise Yes Shallan said that long ago You didnt replace it with a decoy You didnt know youd been tricked until I got out the fabrial and let you save me with it Its all a lie Jasnah No Jasnah said Youre just delusional from your fatigue and the stress Very well Shallan said She stood up clutching the dim sphere I guess Ill have to show you If I can Creatures she said in her head Can you hear me Yes always a whisper came in response Though shed hoped to hear it she still jumped Can you return me to that place she asked You need to tell me something true it replied The more true the stronger our bond Jasnah is using a fake Soulcaster Shallan thought Im sure thats a truth Thats not enough the voice whispered I must know something true about you Tell me The stronger the truth the more hidden it is the more powerful the bond Tell me Tell me What are you What am I Shallan whispered Truthfully It was a day for confrontation She felt strangely strong steady Time to speak it Im a murderer I killed my father Ah the voice whispered A powerful truth indeed And the alcove vanished Shallan fell dropping into that sea of dark glass beads She struggled trying to stay at the surface She managed it for a moment Then something tugged on her leg pulling her down She screamed slipping beneath the surface tiny beads of glass filling her mouth She panicked She was going to The beads above her parted Those beneath her surged bearing her upward out to where someone stood hand outstretched Jasnah back to the black sky face lit by nearby hovering flames Jasnah grasped Shallans hand pulling her upward onto something A raft Made from the beads of glass They seemed to obey Jasnahs will Idiot girl Jasnah said waving The oceanlike beads to the left split and the raft lurched bearing them sideways toward a few flames of light Jasnah shoved Shallan into one of the small flames and she fell backward off the raft And hit the floor of the alcove Jasnah sat where she had been eyes closed A moment later she opened them giving Shallan an angry look Idiot girl Jasnah repeated You have no idea how dangerous that was Visiting Shadesmar with only a single dim sphere Idiot Shallan coughed feeling as if she still had beads in her throat She stumbled to her feet meeting Jasnahs gaze The other woman still looked angry but said nothing She knows that I have her Shallan realized If I spread the truth What would it mean She had strange powers Did that make Jasnah some kind of Voidbringer What would people say No wonder shed created the decoy I want to be part of it Shallan found herself saying Excuse me Whatever youre doing Whatever it is youre researching I want to be part of it You have no idea what youre saying I know Shallan said Im ignorant Theres a simple cure for that She stepped forward I want to know Jasnah I want to be your ward in truth Whatever the source of this thing you can do I can do it too I want you to train me and let me be part of your work You stole from me I know Shallan said And Im sorry Jasnah raised an eyebrow I wont excuse myself Shallan said But Jasnah I came here intending to steal from you I was planning it from the beginning Thats supposed to make me feel better I planned to steal from Jasnah the bitter heretic Shallan said I didnt realize Id come to regret the need for that theft Not just because of you but because it meant leaving this What Ive come to love Please I made a mistake A large one Insurmountable Dont make a larger one by sending me away I can be someone you dont have to lie to Someone who knows Jasnah sat back I stole the fabrial on the night you killed those men Jasnah Shallan said Id decided I couldnt do it but you convinced me that truth was not as simple as I thought it Youve opened a box full of storms in me I made a mistake Ill make more I need you Jasnah took a deep breath Sit down Shallan sat You will never lie to me again Jasnah said raising a finger And you will never steal from me or anyone again I promise Jasnah sat for a moment then sighed Scoot over here she said pulling open a book Shallan obeyed as Jasnah took out several sheets filled with notes What is this Shallan asked You wanted to be part of what Im doing Well youll need to read this Jasnah looked down at the notes Its about the Voidbringers SzethsonsonVallano Truthless of Shinovar walked with bowed back carrying a sack of grain down off the ship and onto the docks of Kharbranth The City of Bells smelled of a fresh ocean morning peaceful yet excited fishermen calling to friends as they prepared their nets Szeth joined the other porters carrying his sack through the twisting streets Perhaps another merchant might have used a chull cart but Kharbranth was infamous for its crowds and its steep walkways A line of porters was an efficient option Szeth kept his eyes down Partially to imitate the look of a worker Partially to lower his gaze from the blazing sun above the god of gods who watched him and saw his shame Szeth should not have been out during the day He should have hidden his terrible face He felt his every step should leave a bloody footprint The massacres hed committed these months working for his hidden master He could hear the dead scream every time he closed his eyes They grated against his soul rubbing it to nothing haunting him consuming him So many dead So very many dead Was he losing his mind Each time he went on an assassination he found himself blaming the victims He cursed them for not being strong enough to fight back and kill him During each of his slaughters he wore white just as he had been commanded One foot in front of the other Dont think Dont focus on what youve done On what youre going to do He had reached the last name on the list Taravangian the king of Kharbranth A beloved monarch known for building and maintaining hospitals in his city It was known as far away as Azir that if you were sick Taravangian would take you in Come to Kharbranth and be healed The king loved all And Szeth was going to kill him At the top of the steep city Szeth lugged his sack with the other porters around to the back of the palace structure entering a dim stone corridor Taravangian was a simpleminded man That should have made Szeth feel more guilty but he found himself consumed by loathing Taravangian would not be smart enough to prepare for Szeth Fool Idiot Would Szeth never face a foe strong enough to kill him Szeth had come to the city early and taken the job as a porter He had needed to research and study for the instructions commanded himfor oncenot to kill anyone else in performing this assassination Taravangians murder was to be done quietly Why the difference The instructions stated that he was to deliver a message The others are dead Ive come to finish the job The instructions were explicit Make certain Taravangian heard and acknowledged the words before harming him This was looking like a work of vengeance Someone had sent Szeth to hunt down and destroy the men who had wronged him Szeth laid his sack down in the palace larder He turned automatically following the shuffling line of porters back down the hallway He nodded toward the servants privy and the portermaster waved for him to go ahead Szeth had made this same haul on several occasions and could be trustedpresumablyto do his business and catch up The privy didnt smell half as foul as he had anticipated It was a dark room cut into the underground cavern but a candle burned beside a man standing at the pissing trough He nodded to Szeth tying up the front of his trousers and wiping his fingers on the sides as he walked to the door He took his candle but kindly lit a leftover stub before withdrawing As soon as he was gone Szeth infused himself with Stormlight from his pouch and laid his hand on the door performing a Full Lashing between it and the frame locking it closed His Shardblade came out next In the palace everything was built downward Trusting the maps hed purchased he knelt and carved a square of rock from the floor wider at the bottom As it began to slide down Szeth infused it with Stormlight performing half a Basic Lashing upward making the rock weightless Next he Lashed himself upward with a subtle Lashing that left him weighing only a tenth his normal weight He leapt onto the rock and his lessened weight pushed the rock down slowly He rode it down into the room below Three couches with plush violet cushions lined the walls sitting beneath fine silver mirrors The lighteyes privy A lamp burned with a small flame in the sconce but Szeth was alone The stone thumped softly to the floor and Szeth leaped off He shed his clothing revealing a black and white masterservants outfit underneath He took a matching cap from the pocket and slipped it on reluctantly dismissed his Blade then slipped into the hallway and quickly Lashed the door shut These days he rarely gave a thought to the fact that he walked on stone Once he would have revered a corridor of rock like this Had that man once been him Had he ever revered anything Szeth hurried onward His time was short Fortunately King Taravangian kept a strict schedule Seventh bell private reflection in his study Szeth could see the doorway into the study ahead guarded by two soldiers Szeth bowed his head hiding his Shin eyes and hurrying up to them One of the men held out his hand wardingly so Szeth grabbed it twisting shattering the wrist He smashed his elbow into the mans face throwing him back against the wall The mans stunned companion opened his mouth to yell but Szeth kicked him in the stomach Even without a Shardblade he was dangerous infused with Stormlight and trained in kammar He grabbed the second guard by the hair and slammed his forehead against the rock floor Then he rose and kicked open the door He walked into a room well illuminated by a double row of lamps on the left Crammed bookcases covered the right wall from floor to ceiling A man sat crosslegged on a small rug directly ahead of Szeth The man looked out an enormous window cut through the rock staring at the ocean beyond Szeth strode forward I have been instructed to tell you that the others are dead Ive come to finish the job He raised his hands Shardblade forming The king did not turn Szeth hesitated He had to make certain the man acknowledged what had been said Did you hear me Szeth demanded striding forward Did you kill my guards SzethsonsonVallano the king asked quietly Szeth froze He cursed and stepped backward raising his Blade in a defensive stance Another trap You have done your work well the king said still not facing him Leaders dead lives lost Panic and chaos Was this your destiny Do you wonder Given that monstrosity of a Shardblade by your people cast out and absolved of any sin your masters might require of you I am not absolved Szeth said still wary It is a common mistake stonewalkers make Each life I take weighs me down eating away at my soul The voices the screams spirits below I can hear them howling Yet you kill It is my punishment Szeth said To kill to have no choice but to bear the sins nonetheless I am Truthless Truthless the king mused I would say that you know much truth More than your countrymen now He finally turned to face Szeth and Szeth saw that he had been wrong about this man King Taravangian was no simpleton He had keen eyes and a wise knowing face rimmed with a full white beard the mustaches drooping like arrow points You have seen what death and murder do to a man You could say SzethsonsonVallano that you bear great sins for your people You understand what they can not And so you have truth Szeth frowned And then it began to make sense He knew what would happen next even as the king reached into his voluminous sleeve and withdrew a small rock that glittered in the light of two dozen lamps You were always him Szeth said My unseen master The king set the rock on the ground between them Szeths Oathstone You put your own name on the list Szeth said In case you were captured Taravangian said The best defense against suspicion is to be grouped with the victims And if Id killed you The instructions were explicit Taravangian said And as we have determined you are quite good at following them I probably neednt say it but I order you not to harm me Now did you kill my guards I do not know Szeth said forcing himself to drop to one knee and dismissing his Blade He spoke loudly trying to drown out the screams that he thoughtfor certainmust be coming from the upper eaves of the room I knocked them both unconscious I believe I cracked one mans skull Taravangian breathed out sighing He rose stepping to the doorway Szeth glanced over his shoulder to note the aged king inspecting the guards and seeing to their wounds Taravangian called for help and other guards arrived to see to the men Szeth was left with a terrible storm of emotions This kindly contemplative man had sent him to kill and murder He had caused the screams Taravangian returned Why Szeth asked voice hoarse Vengeance No Taravangian sounded very tired Some of those men you killed were my dear friends SzethsonsonVallano More insurance Szeth spat To keep yourself from suspicion In part And in part because their deaths were necessary Why Szeth asked What could it possibly have served Stability Those you killed were among the most powerful and influential men in Roshar How does that help stability Sometimes Taravangian said you must tear down a structure to build a new one with stronger walls He turned around looking out over the ocean And we are going to need strong walls in the coming years Very very strong walls Your words are like the hundred doves Easy to release difficult to keep Taravangian said speaking the words in Shin Szeth looked up sharply This man spoke the Shin language and knew his peoples proverbs Odd to find in a stonewalker Odder to find in a murderer Yes I speak your language Sometimes I wonder if the Lifebrother himself sent you to me To bloody myself so that you wouldnt have to Szeth said Yes that sounds like something one of your Vorin gods would do Taravangian fell quiet Get up he finally said Szeth obeyed He would always obey his master Taravangian led him to a door set into the side of the study The aged man pulled a sphere lamp off the wall lighting a winding stairwell of deep narrow steps They followed it and eventually came to a landing Taravangian pushed open another door and entered a large room that wasnt on any of the palace maps that Szeth had purchased or bribed a look at It was long with wide railings on the sides giving it a terraced look Everything was painted white It was filled with beds Hundreds and hundreds of them Many were occupied Szeth followed the king frowning An enormous hidden room cut into the stone of the Conclave People bustled about wearing coats of white A hospital Szeth said You expect me to find your humanitarian eff orts a redemption for what you have commanded of me This is not humanitarian work Taravangian said walking forward slowly whiteandorange robes rustling Those they passed bowed to him with reverence Taravangian led Szeth to an alcove of beds each with a sickly person in it There were healers working on them Doing something to their arms Draining their blood A woman with a writing clipboard stood near the beds pen held waiting for something What I dont understand Szeth said watching in horror as the four patients grew pale Youre killing them arent you Yes We dont need the blood it is merely a way to kill slowly and easily Every one of them The people in this room We try to select only the worst cases to move here for once they are brought to this place we can not let them leave if they begin to recover He turned to Szeth eyes sorrowful Sometimes we need more bodies than the terminally sick can provide And so we must bring the forgotten and the lowly Those who will not be missed Szeth couldnt speak He couldnt voice his horror and revulsion In front of him one of the victimsa man in his younger yearsexpired Two of those remaining were children Szeth stepped forward He had to stop this He had to You will still yourself Taravangian said And you will return to my side Szeth did as his master commanded What were a few more deaths Just another set of screams to haunt him He could hear them now coming from beneath beds behind furniture Or I could kill him Szeth thought I could stop this He nearly did it But honor prevailed for the moment You see SzethsonsonVallano Taravangian said I did not send you to do my bloody work for me I do it here myself I have personally held the knife and released the blood from the veins of many Much like you I know I can not escape my sins We are two men of one heart This is one reason why I sought you out But why Szeth said On the beds a dying youth started speaking One of the women with the clipboards stepped forward quickly recording the words The day was ours but they took it the boy cried Stormfather You can not have it The day is ours They come rasping and the lights fail Oh Stormfather The boy arched his back then fell still suddenly eyes dead The king turned to Szeth It is better for one man to sin than for a people to be destroyed wouldnt you say SzethsonsonVallano I We do not know why some speak when others do not Taravangian said But the dying see something It began seven years ago about the time when King Gavilar was investigating the Shattered Plains for the first time His eyes grew distant It is coming and these people see it On that bridge between life and the endless ocean of death they view something Their words might save us You are a monster Yes Taravangian said But I am the monster who will save this world He looked at Szeth I have a name to add to your list I had hoped to avoid doing this but recent events have made it inevitable I can not let him seize control It will undermine everything Who Szeth asked wondering if anything at all could horrify him further Dalinar Kholin Taravangian said Im afraid it must be done quickly before he can unite the Alethi highprinces You will go to the Shattered Plains and end him He hesitated It must be done brutally Im afraid I have rarely had the luxury of working otherwise Szeth said closing his eyes The screams greeted him Before I read Shallan said I need to understand something You Soulcast my blood didnt you To remove the poison Jasnah said Yes It acted extremely quickly as I said it must have been a very concentrated form of the powder I had to Soulcast your blood several times as we got you to vomit Your body continued to absorb the poison But you said you arent good with organics Shallan said You turned the strawberry jam into something inedible Blood isnt the same Jasnah said waving her hand Its one of the Essences Youll learn this should I actually decide to teach you Soulcasting For now know that the pure form of an Essence is quite easy to make the eight kinds of blood are easier to create than water for instance Creating something as complex as strawberry jam howevera mush made from a fruit Id never before tasted or smelledwas well beyond my abilities And the ardents Shallan said Those who Soulcast Do they actually use fabrials or is it all a hoax No Soulcasting fabrials are real Quite real So far as I know everyone else who does what Iwhat wecan do uses a fabrial to accomplish it What of the creatures with the symbol heads Shallan asked She flipped through her sketches then held up an image of them Do you see them too How are they related Jasnah frowned taking the image You see beings like this In Shadesmar They appear in my drawings Shallan said Theyre around me Jasnah You dont see them Am I Jasnah held up a hand These are a type of spren Shallan They are related to what you do She tapped the desk softly Two orders of the Knights Radiant possessed inherent Soulcasting ability it was based on their powers that the original fabrials were designed I believe I had assumed that you But no that obviously wouldnt make sense I see now What I will explain as I train you Jasnah said handing back the sheet You will need a greater foundation before you can grasp it Suffice it to say that each Radiants abilities were tied to the spren Wait Radiants But I will explain Jasnah said But first we must speak of the Voidbringers Shallan nodded You think theyll return dont you Jasnah studied her What makes you say that The legends say the Voidbringers came a hundred times to try to destroy mankind Shallan continued I read some of your notes You what I was looking for information on Soulcasting Shallan confessed Jasnah sighed Well I suppose it is the least of your crimes I cant understand Shallan said Why are you bothering with these stories of myths and shadows Other scholarsscholars I know you respectconsider the Voidbringers to be a fabrication Yet you chase stories from rural farmers and write them down in your notebook Why Jasnah Why do you have faith in this when you reject things that are so much more plausible Jasnah looked over her sheets of paper Do you know the real difference between me and a believer Shallan Shallan shook her head It strikes me that religionin its essenceseeks to take natural events and ascribe supernatural causes to them I however seek to take supernatural events and find the natural meanings behind them Perhaps that is the final dividing line between science and religion Opposite sides of a card So you think The Voidbringers had a natural realworld correlate Jasnah said firmly Im certain of it Something caused the legends What was it Jasnah handed Shallan a page of notes These are the best Ive been able to find Read them Tell me what you think Shallan scanned the page Some of the quotesor at least the conceptswere familiar to her from what shed read already Suddenly dangerous Like a calm day that became a tempest They were real Jasnah repeated Beings of ash and fire We fought with them Jasnah said We fought so often that men began to speak of the creatures in metaphor A hundred battlesten tenfolds Flame and char Skin so terrible Eyes like pits of blackness Music when they kill We defeated them Jasnah said Shallan felt a chill but the legends lie about one thing Jasnah continued They claim we chased the Voidbringers off the face of Roshar or destroyed them But thats not how humans work We dont throw away something we can use Shallan rose walking to the edge of the balcony looking out at the lift which was slowly being lowered by its two porters Parshmen With skin of black and red Ash and fire Stormfather Shallan whispered horrified We didnt destroy the Voidbringers Jasnah said from behind her voice haunted We enslaved them The chill spring weather might finally have slipped back into summer It was still cool at night but not uncomfortably so Kaladin stood on Dalinar Kholins staging ground looking eastward over the Shattered Plains Ever since the failed betrayal and subsequent rescue earlier Kaladin had found himself nervous Freedom Bought with a Shardblade It seemed impossible His every life experience taught him to expect a trap He clasped his hands behind him Syl sat on his shoulder Dare I trust him he asked softly Hes a good man Syl said Ive watched him Despite that thing he carried That thing The Shardblade What do you care about it I dont know she said wrapping her arms around herself It just feels wrong to me I hate it Im glad he got rid of it Makes him a better man Nomon the middle moon began to rise Bright and pale blue bathing the horizon in light Somewhere out across the Plains was the Parshendi Shardbearer that Kaladin had fought Hed stabbed the man in the leg from behind The watching Parshendi had not interfered with the duel and had avoided attacking Kaladins wounded bridgemen but Kaladin had attacked one of their champions from the most cowardly position possible interfering with a fight He was bothered by what hed done and that frustrated him A warrior couldnt worry about who he attacked or how Survival was the only rule of the battlefield Well survival and loyalty And he sometimes let wounded enemies live if they werent a threat And he saved young soldiers who needed protection And And hed never been good at doing what a warrior should Today hed saved a highprinceanother lighteyesand along with him thousands of soldiers Saved them by killing Parshendi Can you kill to protect Kaladin asked out loud Is that a selfcontradiction I I dont know You acted strangely in the battle Kaladin said Swirling around me After that you left I didnt see much of you The killing she said softly It hurt me I had to go Yet youre the one who prompted me to go and save Dalinar You wanted me to return and kill I know Teft said that the Radiants held to a standard Kaladin said He said that by their rules you shouldnt do terrible things to accomplish great ones Yet what did I do today Slaughter Parshendi in order to save Alethi What of that They arent innocent but neither are we Not by a faint breeze or a stormwind Syl didnt reply If I hadnt gone to save Dalinars men Kaladin said I would have allowed Sadeas to commit a terrible betrayal Id have let men die who I could have saved Id have been sick and disgusted with myself I also lost three good men bridgemen who were mere breaths away from freedom Are the lives of the others worth that I dont have the answers Kaladin Does anyone Footsteps came from behind Syl turned Its him The moon had just risen Dalinar Kholin it appeared was a punctual man He stepped up beside Kaladin He carried a bundle under his arm and he had a military air about him even without his Shardplate on In fact he was more impressive without it His muscular build indicated that he did not rely on his Plate to give him strength and the neatly pressed uniform indicated a man who understood that others were inspired when their leader looked the part Others have looked just as noble Kaladin thought But would any man trade a Shardblade just to keep up appearances And if they would at what point did the appearance become reality Im sorry to make you meet me so late Dalinar said I know it has been a long day I doubt I could have slept anyway Dalinar grunted softly as if he understood Your men are seen to Yes Kaladin said Quite well actually Thank you Kaladin had been given empty barracks for the bridgemen and they had received medical attention from Dalinars best surgeonstheyd gotten it before the wounded lighteyed officers had The other bridgemen the ones who werent from Bridge Four had accepted Kaladin immediately without any deliberation on the matter as their leader Dalinar nodded How many do you suspect will take my offer of a purse and freedom A fair number of the men from other crews will But Ill wager an even larger number wont Bridgemen dont think of escape or freedom They wouldnt know what to do with themselves As for my own crew Well I have a feeling that theyll insist on doing whatever I do If I stay theyll stay If I go theyll go Dalinar nodded And what will you do I havent decided yet I spoke to my officers Dalinar grimaced The ones who survived They said that you gave orders to them took charge like a lighteyes My son still feels bitter about the way your conversation with him went Even a fool could see he wasnt going to be able to get to you As for the officers most were in shock or run ragged I merely nudged them I owe you my life twice over Dalinar said And that of my son and my men You paid that debt No Dalinar said But Ive done what I can He eyed Kaladin as if sizing him up judging him Why did your bridge crew come for us Why really Why did you give up your Shardblade Dalinar held his eyes then nodded Fair enough I have an offer for you The king and I are about to do something very very dangerous Something that will upset all the warcamps Congratulations Dalinar smiled faintly My honor guard has nearly been wiped out and the men I do have are needed to augment the Kings Guard My trust is stretched thin these days I need someone to protect me and my family I want you and your men for that job You want a bunch of bridgemen as bodyguards The elite ones as bodyguards Dalinar said Those in your crew the ones you trained I want the rest as soldiers for my army I have heard how well your men fought You trained them without Sadeass knowing all while running bridges Im curious to see what you could do with the right resources Dalinar turned away glancing northward Toward Sadeass camp My army is depleted Im going to need every man I can get but everyone I recruit is going to be suspect Sadeas will try to send spies into our camp And traitors And assassins Elhokar thinks we wont last a week Stormfather Kaladin said What are you planning Im going to take away their games fully expecting them to react like children losing their favored toy These children have armies and Shardblades Unfortunately And this is what you want me to protect you from Yes No quibbling Straightforward There was much to respect about that Ill augment Bridge Four to become the honor guard Kaladin said And train the rest as a spearman company Those in the honor guard get paid like it Generally a lighteyess personal guard got triple a standard spearmans wage Of course And I want space to train Kaladin said Full right of requisition from the quartermasters I get to set my mens schedule and we appoint our own sergeants and squadleaders We dont answer to any lighteyes but yourself your sons and the king Dalinar raised an eyebrow That last one is a little irregular You want me to guard you and your family Kaladin said Against the other highprinces and their assassins who might infiltrate your army and your officers Well I cant be in a position where any lighteyes in the camp can order me around now can I You have a point Dalinar said You realize however that in doing this I would essentially be giving you the same authority as a lighteyes of fourth dahn Youd be in charge of a thousand former bridgemen A full battalion Yes Dalinar thought for a moment Very well Consider yourself appointed to the rank of captainthats as high as I dare appoint a darkeyes If I named you battalionlord it would cause a whole mess of problems Ill let it be known however that youre outside the chain of command You dont order around lighteyes of lesser rank than you and lighteyes of higher rank have no authority over you All right Kaladin said But these soldiers I train I want them assigned to patrolling not plateau runs I hear youve had several full battalions hunting bandits keeping the peace in the Outer Market that sort of thing Thats where my men go for one year at least Easy enough Dalinar said You want time to train them before throwing them into battle I assume That and I killed a lot of Parshendi today I found myself regretting their deaths They showed me more honor than most members of my own army have I didnt like the feeling and I want some time to think about it The bodyguards I train for you well go out onto the field but our primary purpose will be protecting you not killing Parshendi Dalinar looked bemused All right Though you shouldnt have to worry I dont plan to be on the front lines much in the future My role is changing Regardless we have a deal Kaladin held out a hand This is contingent on my men agreeing I thought you said that theyd do what you did Probably Kaladin said I command them but I dont own them Dalinar reached out taking his hand shaking it by the light of the rising sapphire moon Then he took the bundle out from underneath his arm Here What is this Kaladin said taking the bundle My cloak The one I wore to battle today washed and patched Kaladin unfurled it It was of a deep blue with the glyphpair of khokh and linil sewn into the back in white embroidery Each man who wears my colors Dalinar said is of my family in a way The cloak is a simple gift but it is one of the few things I can offer that has any meaning Accept it with my gratitude Kaladin Stormblessed Kaladin slowly refolded the cloak Where did you hear that name Your men Dalinar said They think very highly of you And that makes me think very highly of you I need men like you like all of you He narrowed his eyes looking thoughtful The whole kingdom needs you Perhaps all of Roshar The True Desolation comes What was that last part Nothing Dalinar said Please go get some rest Captain I hope to hear good news from you soon Kaladin nodded and withdrew passing the two men who acted as Dalinars guard for the night The hike back to his new barracks was a short one Dalinar had given him one building for each of the bridge crews Over a thousand men What was he going to do with so many Hed never commanded a group larger than twentyfive before Bridge Fours barrack was empty Kaladin hesitated outside the doorway looking in The barrack was furnished with a bunk and locking chest for each man It seemed a palace He smelled smoke Frowning he rounded the barrack to find the men sitting around a firepit in the back relaxing on stumps or stones waiting as Rock cooked them a pot of stew They were listening to Teft who sat with his arm bandaged speaking quietly Shen was there the quiet parshman sat at the very edge of the group Theyd recovered him along with their wounded from Sadeass camp Teft cut off as soon as he saw Kaladin and the men turned most of them bearing bandages of some sort Dalinar wants these for his bodyguards Kaladin thought They were a ragged bunch indeed As it happened however he seconded Dalinars choice If he were going to put his life in someones hands hed choose this group What are you doing Kaladin asked sternly You should all be resting The bridgemen glanced at each other It just Moash said It didnt feel right to go to sleep until wed had a chance to well do this Hard to sleep on a day like this gancho Lopen added Speak for yourself Skar said yawning wounded leg resting up on a stump But the stew is worth staying up for Even if he does put rocks in it I do not Rock snapped Airsick lowlanders Theyd left a place for Kaladin He sat down using Dalinars cloak as a cushion for his back and head He gratefully took a bowl of stew that Drehy handed him Weve been talking about what the men saw today Teft said The things you did Kaladin hesitated spoon to his mouth Hed nearly forgottenor maybe hed intentionally forgottenthat hed shown his men what he could do with Stormlight Hopefully Dalinars soldiers hadnt seen His Stormlight had been faint by then the day bright I see Kaladin said his appetite fleeing Did they see him as different Frightening Something to be ostracized as his father had been back in Hearthstone Worse yet something to be worshipped He looked into their wide eyes and braced himself It was amazing Drehy said leaning forward Youre one of the Radiants Skar said pointing I believe it even if Teft says you arent He isnt yet Teft snapped Dont you listen Can you teach me to do what you did Moash cut in Ill learn too gancho Lopen said You know if youre teaching and all Kaladin blinked overwhelmed as the others chimed in What can you do How does it feel Can you fly He held up a hand stanching the questions Arent you alarmed by what you saw Several of the men shrugged It kept you alive gancho Lopen said The only thing Id be alarmed about is how irresistible the women would find it Lopen theyd say you only have one arm but I see that you can glow I think that you should kiss me now But its strange and frightening Kaladin protested This is what the Radiants did Everyone knows they were traitors Yeah Moash said snorting Just like everyone knows that the lighteyes are chosen by the Almighty to rule and how theyre always noble and just Were Bridge Four Skar added Weve been around Weve lived in the crem and been used as bait If it helps you survive its good Thats all that needs to be said about it So can you teach it Moash asked Can you show us how to do what you do I I dont know if it can be taught Kaladin said glancing at Syl who bore a curious expression as she sat on a nearby rock Im not certain what it is They looked crestfallen But Kaladin added that doesnt mean that we shouldnt try Moash smiled Can you do it Drehy asked fishing out a sphere a small glowing diamond chip Right now I want to see it when Im expecting it Its not a feastday sport Drehy Kaladin said Dont you think we deserve it Sigzil leaned forward on his stone Kaladin paused Then hesitantly he reached out a finger and touched the sphere He inhaled sharply drawing in the Light was becoming more and more natural The sphere faded Stormlight began to trickle from Kaladins skin and he breathed normally to make it leak faster making it more visible Rock pulled out a ragged old blanketused for kindling and tossed it over the fire disturbing the flamespren and making a few moments of darkness before the flames chewed through In that darkness Kaladin glowed pure white Light rising from his skin Storms Drehy breathed So what can you do with it Skar asked eager You didnt answer Im not entirely certain what I can do Kaladin said holding his hand up in front of him It faded in a moment and the fire burned through the blanket lighting them all again Ive only known about it for sure for a few weeks I can draw arrows toward me and can make rocks stick together The Light makes me stronger and faster and it heals my wounds How much stronger does it make you Sigzil said How much weight can the rocks bear after you stick them together and how long do they remain bonded How much faster do you get Twice as fast A quarter again as fast How far away can an arrow be when you draw it toward you and can you draw other things as well Kaladin blinked I I dont know Well it seems pretty important to know that kind of stuff Skar said rubbing his chin We can do tests Rock folded his arms smiling Is good idea Maybe it will help us figure out how we can do it too Moash noted Is not thing to learn Rock shook his head Is of the holetental For him only You dont know that for certain Teft said You dont know for certain I dont know for certain Rock wagged a spoon at him Eat your stew Kaladin held up his hands You cant tell anyone about this men Theyll be frightened of me maybe think Im related to the Voidbringers or the Radiants I need your oaths on this He looked at them and they nodded one by one But we want to help Skar said Even if we cant learn it This thing is part of you and youre one of us Bridge Four Right Kaladin looked at their eager faces and couldnt stop himself from nodding Yes Yes you can help Excellent Sigzil said Ill prepare a list of tests to gauge speed accuracy and the strength of these bonds you can create Well have to find a way to determine if theres anything else you can do Throw him off cliff Rock said What good will that do Peet asked Rock shrugged If he has other abilities this thing will make them come out eh Nothing like falling from cliff to make a man out of a boy Kaladin regarded him with a sour expression and Rock laughed It will be small cliff He held up his thumb and forefinger to indicate a tiny amount I like you too much for large one I think youre joking Kaladin said taking a bite of his stew But just to be safe Im sticking you to the ceiling tonight to keep you from trying any experiments while Im asleep The bridgemen chuckled Just dont glow too brightly while were trying to sleep eh gancho Lopen said Ill do my best He took another spoonful of stew It tasted better than usual Had Rock changed the recipe Or was it something else As he settled back to eat the other bridgemen began chatting speaking of home and their pasts things that had once been taboo Several of the men from other crewswounded whom Kaladin had helped even just a few lonely souls who were still awake wandered over The men of Bridge Four welcomed them handing over stew and making room Everyone looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt but nobody spoke of turning in He could see why now Being together eating Rocks stew listening to the quiet chatter while the fire crackled and popped sending dancing flakes of yellow light into the air This was more relaxing than sleep could be Kaladin smiled leaning back looking upward toward the dark sky and the large sapphire moon Then he closed his eyes listening Three more men were dead Malop Earless Jaks and Narm Kaladin had failed them But he and Bridge Four had protected hundreds of others Hundreds who would never have to run a bridge again would never have to face Parshendi arrows would never have to fight again if they didnt want to More personally twentyseven of his friends lived Partially because of what hed done partially because of their own heroism Twentyseven men lived Hed finally managed to save someone For now that was enough Shallan rubbed her eyes Shed read through Jasnahs notesat least the most important ones Those alone had made a large stack She still sat in the alcove though theyd sent a parshman to get her a blanket to wrap around herself covering up the hospital robe Her eyes burned from the night spent crying then reading She was exhausted And yet she also felt alive Its true she said Youre right The Voidbringers are the parshmen I can see no other conclusion Jasnah smiled looking oddly pleased with herself considering that shed only convinced one person So what next Shallan asked That has to do with your previous studies My studies You mean your fathers death Indeed The Parshendi attacked him Shallan said Killed him suddenly without warning She focused on the other woman Thats what made you begin studying all of this isnt it Jasnah nodded Those wild parshmenthe Parshendi of the Shattered Plainsare the key She leaned forward Shallan The disaster awaiting us is all too real all too terrible I dont need mystical warnings or theological sermons to frighten me Im downright terrified in my own right But we have the parshmen tamed Do we Shallan think of what they do how theyre regarded how often theyre used Shallan hesitated The parshmen were pervasive They serve our food Jasnah continued They work our storehouses They tend our children There isnt a village in Roshar that doesnt have some parshmen We ignore them we just expect them to be there doing as they do Working without complaint Yet one group turned suddenly from peaceful friends to slaughtering warriors Something set them off Just as it did hundreds of years ago during the days known as the Heraldic Epochs There would be a period of peace followed by an invasion of parshmen whofor reasons nobody understoodhad suddenly gone mad with anger and rage This was what was behind mankinds fight to keep from being banished to Damnation This was what nearly ended our civilization This was the terrible repeated cataclysm that was so frightening men began to speak of them as Desolations Weve nurtured the parshmen Weve integrated them into every part of our society We depend on them never realizing that weve harnessed a highstorm waiting to explode The accounts from the Shattered Plains speak of these Parshendis ability to communicate among themselves allowing them to sing their songs in unison when far apart Their minds are connected like spanreeds Do you realize what that means Shallan nodded What would happen if every parshman on Roshar suddenly turned against his masters Seeking freedom or worsevengeance Wed be devastated Civilization as we know it could collapse We have to do something We are Jasnah said Were gathering facts making certain we know what we think we know And how many facts do we need More Many more Jasnah glanced at the books There are some things about the histories I dont yet understand Tales of creatures fighting alongside the parshmen beasts of stone that might be some kind of greatshell and other oddities that I think may have truth to them But weve exhausted what Kharbranth can offer Are you still certain you want to delve into this It is a heavy burden we will bear You wont be returning to your estates for some time Shallan bit her lip thinking of her brothers Youd let me go now after what I know I wont have you serving me while thinking of ways to escape Jasnah sounded exhausted I cant just abandon my brothers Shallans insides twisted again But this is bigger than them Damnationits bigger than me or you or any of us I have to help Jasnah I cant walk out on this Ill find some other way to help my family Good Then go pack our things Were leaving tomorrow on that ship I chartered for you Were going to Jah Keved No We need to get to the center of it all She looked at Shallan Were going to the Shattered Plains We need to find out if the Parshendi were ever ordinary parshmen and if so what set them off Perhaps I am wrong about this but if I am right then the Parshendi could hold the key to turning ordinary parshmen into soldiers Then grimly she continued And we need to do it before someone else does then uses it against us Someone else Shallan asked feeling a sharp stab of panic There are others looking for this Of course there are Who do you think went to so much trouble trying to have me assassinated She reached into a stack of papers on her desk I dont know much about them For all I know there are many groups searching for these secrets I know of one for certain however They call themselves the Ghostbloods She pulled out a sheet Your friend Kabsal was one We found their symbol tattooed on the inside of his arm She set the sheet down On it was a symbol of three diamonds in a pattern overlapping one another It was the same symbol that Nan Balat had shown her weeks ago The symbol worn by Luesh her fathers steward the man who had known how to use the Soulcaster The symbol worn by the men who had come pressuring her family to return it The men who had been financing Shallans father in his bid to become highprince Almighty above Shallan whispered She looked up Jasnah I think I think my father might have been a member of this group The highstorm winds began to blow against Dalinars complex powerful enough to make rocks groan Navani huddled close to Dalinar holding to him She smelled wonderful It felt humbling to know how terrified shed been for him Her joy at having him back was enough to dampen for now her fury at him for how hed treated Elhokar She would come around It had needed to be done As the highstorm hit in force Dalinar felt the vision coming on He closed his eyes letting it take him He had a decision to make a responsibility What to do These visions had lied to him or had at least misled him It seemed that he couldnt trust them at least not as explicitly as he once had He took a deep breath opened his eyes and found himself in a place of smoke He turned about wary The sky was dark and he stood on a field of dull bonewhite rock jagged and rough extending in all directions Off into eternity Amorphous shapes made of curling grey smoke rose from the ground Like smoke rings only in other shapes Here a chair There a rockbud with vines extended curling to the sides and vanishing Beside him appeared the figure of a man in uniform silent and vaporous rising lethargically toward the sky mouth open The shapes melted and distorted as they climbed higher though they seemed to hold their forms longer than they should It was unnerving standing on the eternal plain pure darkness above smoke figures rising all around It wasnt like any vision hed seen before It was No wait He frowned stepping back as the figure of a tree burst from the ground close to him I have seen this place before In the first of my visions so many months ago It was fuzzy in his mind Hed been disoriented the vision vague as if his mind hadnt learned to accept what it was seeing In fact the only thing he remembered distinctly was You must unite them a strong voice boomed was the voice Speaking to him from all around causing the smoke figures to fuzz and distort Why did you lie to me Dalinar demanded of the open darkness I did what you said and I was betrayed Unite them The sun approaches the horizon The Everstorm comes The True Desolation The Night of Sorrows I need answers Dalinar said I dont trust you any longer If you want me to listen to you youll need to The vision changed He spun about finding that he was still on an open plain of rock but the normal sun was in the sky The stone field looked like an ordinary one on Roshar It was very odd for one of the visions to set him in a place without others to talk to and interact with Though for once he wore his own clothing The sharp blue Kholin uniform Had this happened before the other time hed been in that place of smoke Yes it had This was the first time hed been taken to a place where hed been before Why He carefully scanned the scenery Since the voice didnt speak to him again he began to walk passing cracked boulders and broken bits of shale pebbles and rocks There were no plants not even rockbuds Just an empty landscape filled with broken stones Eventually he spotted a ridge Getting to high ground felt like a good idea though the hike seemed to take hours The vision did not end Time was often odd in these visions He continued to hike up the side of the rock formation wishing he had his Shardplate to strengthen him Finally at the top he walked over to the edge to look down below And there he saw Kholinar his home the capital city of Alethkar It had been destroyed The beautiful buildings had been shattered The windblades were cast down There were no bodies just broken stone This wasnt like the vision he had seen before with Nohadon That wasnt the Kholinar of the distant past he could see the rubble of his own palace But there was no rock formation like the one he stood on near Kholinar in the real world Always before these visions had shown him the past Was this now a vision of the future I can not fight him any longer the voice said Dalinar jumped glancing to the side A man stood there He had dark skin and pure white hair Tall thick of chest but not massive he wore exotic clothing of a strange cut loose billowing trousers and a coat that came down only to his waist Both seemed made of gold Yes this very thing had happened before in his very first vision Dalinar could remember it now Who are you Dalinar demanded Why are you showing me these visions You can see it there the figure said pointing If you look closely It begins in the distance Dalinar glanced in that direction annoyed He couldnt make out anything specific Storm it Dalinar said Wont you answer my questions for once What is the good of all of this if you just speak in riddles The man didnt answer He just kept pointing And yes something was happening There was a shadow in the air approaching A wall of darkness Like a highstorm only wrong At least tell me this Dalinar said What time are we seeing Is this the past the future or something else entirely The figure didnt answer immediately Then he said Youre probably wondering if this is a vision of the future Dalinar started I just I just asked This was familiar Too familiar He said that exact thing last time Dalinar realized feeling a chill This all happened Im seeing the same vision again The figure squinted at the horizon I can not see the future completely Cultivation she is better at it than I Its as if the future is a shattering window The further you look the more pieces that window breaks into The near future can be anticipated but the distant future I can only guess You cant hear me can you Dalinar asked feeling a horror as he finally began to understand You never could Blood of my fathers hes not ignoring me He cant see me He doesnt speak in riddles It just seems that way because I took his responses as cryptic answers to my questions He didnt tell me to trust Sadeas I I just assumed Everything seemed to shake around Dalinar His preconceptions what hed thought hed known The ground itself That is what could happen the figure said nodding into the distance Its what I fear will happen Its what he wants The True Desolation No that wall in the air wasnt a highstorm It wasnt rain making that enormous shadow but blowing dust He remembered this vision in full now It had ended here with him confused staring out at that oncoming wall of dust This time however the vision continued The figure turned to him I am sorry to do this to you By now I hope that what youve seen has given you a foundation to understand But I cant know for certain I dont know who you are or how you have found your way here I What to say Did it matter Most of what I show you are scenes I have seen directly the figure said But some such as this one are born out of my fears If I fear it then you should too The land was trembling The wall of dust was being caused by something Something approaching The ground was falling away Dalinar gasped The very rocks ahead were shattering breaking apart becoming dust He backed away as everything began to shake a massive earthquake accompanied by a terrible roar of dying rocks He fell to the ground There was an awful grinding terrifying moment of nightmare The shaking the destruction the sounds of the land itself seeming to die Then it was past Dalinar breathed in and out before rising on unsteady legs He and the figure stood on a solitary pinnacle of rock A little section thatfor some reasonhad been protected It was like a stone pillar a few paces wide rising high into the air Around it the land was gone Kholinar was gone It had all fallen away into unplumbed darkness below He felt vertigo standing on the tiny bit of rock thatimpossiblyremained What is this Dalinar demanded though he knew that the being couldnt hear him The figure looked about sorrowful I cant leave much Just these few images given to you Whoever you are These visions theyre like a journal arent they A history you wrote a book you left behind except I dont read it I see it The figure looked into the sky I dont even know if anyone will ever see this I am gone you see Dalinar didnt respond He looked over the sheer pinnacle down at a void horrified This isnt just about you either the figure said raising his hand into the air A light winked out in the sky one that Dalinar hadnt realized was there Then another winked out as well The sun seemed to be growing dimmer Its about all of them the figure said I should have realized hed come for me Who are you Dalinar asked voicing the words to himself The figure still stared into the sky I leave this because there must be something A hope to discover A chance that someone will find what to do Do you wish to fight him Yes Dalinar found himself saying despite knowing that it didnt matter I dont know who he is but if he wants to do this then I will fight him Someone must lead them I will do it Dalinar said The words just came out Someone must unite them I will do it Someone must protect them I will do it The figure was silent for a moment Then he spoke in a clear crisp voice Life before death Strength before weakness Journey before destination Speak again the ancient oaths and return to men the Shards they once bore He turned to Dalinar meeting his eyes The Knights Radiant must stand again I can not comprehend how that can be done Dalinar said softly But I will try Men must face them together the figure said stepping up to Dalinar placing a hand on his shoulder You can not squabble as in times past Hes realized that you given time will become your own enemies That he doesnt need to fight you Not if he can make you forget make you turn against one another Your legends say that you won But the truth is that we lost And we are losing Who are you Dalinar asked again voice softer I wish I could do more repeated the figure in gold You might be able to get him to choose a champion He is bound by some rules All of us are A champion could work well for you but it is not certain And without the Dawnshards Well I have done what I can It is a terrible terrible thing to leave you alone Who are you Dalinar asked again And yet he thought he knew I am I was God The one you call the Almighty the creator of mankind The figure closed his eyes And now I am dead Odium has killed me I am sorry Can you feel it Wit asked of the open night Something just changed I believe thats the sound the world makes when it pisses itself Three guards stood just inside the thick wooden city gates of Kholinar The men regarded Wit with worry The gates were closed and these men were of the night watch a somewhat inappropriate title They didnt spend time watching so much as chatting yawning gambling orin tonights casestanding uncomfortably and listening to a crazy man That crazy man happened to have blue eyes which let him get away with all kinds of trouble Perhaps Wit should have been bemused by the stock these people put in something as simple as eye color but he had been many places and seen many methods of rule This didnt seem any more ridiculous than most others And of course there was a reason the people did what they did Well there was usually a reason In this case it just happened to be a good one Brightlord one of the guards asked looking at where Wit sat on his boxes Theyd been piled there and left by a merchant who had tipped the night watchmen to make certain nothing was stolen To Wit they simply made a convenient perch His pack sat beside him and on his knees he was tuning his enthir a square stringed instrument You played it from above plucking at strings with it sitting on your lap Brightlord the guard repeated What are you doing up there Waiting Wit said He looked up glancing eastward Waiting for the storm to arrive That made the guards more uncomfortable A highstorm was not predicted this night Wit began playing the enthir Let us have a conversation to pass the time Tell me What is it that men value in others The music played toward an audience of silent buildings alleys and worn cobblestones The guards didnt respond to him They didnt seem to know what to make of a blackclad lighteyed man who entered the city just before evening fell then sat on boxes beside the gates playing music Well Wit asked pausing the music What do you think If a man or woman were to have a talent which would be the most revered best regarded considered of the most worth Er music one of the men finally said Yes a common answer Wit said plucking at a few low notes I once asked this question of some very wise scholars What do men consider the most valuable of talents One mentioned artistic ability as you so keenly guessed Another chose great intellect The final chose the talent to invent the ability to design and create great devices He didnt play a specific tune on the enthir just plucks here and there an occasional scale or fifth Like chitchat in string form Aesthetic genius Wit said invention acumen creativity Noble ideals indeed Most men would pick one of those if given the choice and name them the greatest of talents He plucked a string What beautiful liars we are The guards glanced at each other the torches burning in brackets on the wall painted them with orange light You think Im a cynic Wit said You think Im going to tell you that men claim to value these ideals but secretly prefer base talents The ability to gather coin or to charm women Well I am a cynic but in this case I actually think those scholars were honest Their answers speak for the souls of men In our hearts we want to believe inand would choose great accomplishment and virtue Thats why our lies particularly to ourselves are so beautiful He began to play a real song A simple melody at first soft subdued A song for a silent night when the entire world changed One of the soldiers cleared his throat So what is the most valuable talent a man can have He sounded genuinely curious I havent the faintest idea Wit said Fortunately that wasnt the question I didnt ask what was most valuable I asked what men value most The difference between those questions is both tiny and as vast as the world itself all at once He kept plucking his song One did not strum an enthir It just wasnt done at least not by people with any sense of propriety In this Wit said as in all things our actions give us away If an artist creates a work of powerful beautyusing new and innovative techniquesshe will be lauded as a master and will launch a new movement in aesthetics Yet what if another working independently with that exact level of skill were to make the same accomplishments the very next month Would she find similar acclaim No Shed be called derivative Intellect If a great thinker develops a new theory of mathematics science or philosophy we will name him wise We will sit at his feet and learn and will record his name in history for thousands upon thousands to revere But what if another man determines the same theory on his own then delays in publishing his results by a mere week Will he be remembered for his greatness No He will be forgotten Invention A woman builds a new design of great worthsome fabrial or feat of engineering She will be known as an innovator But if someone with the same talent creates the same design a year laternot realizing it has already been craftedwill she be rewarded for her creativity No Shell be called a copier and a forger He plucked at his strings letting the melody continue twisting haunting yet with a faint edge of mockery And so he said in the end what must we determine Is it the intellect of a genius that we revere If it were their artistry the beauty of their mind would we not laud it regardless of whether wed seen their product before But we dont Given two works of artistic majesty otherwise weighted equally we will give greater acclaim to the one who did it first It doesnt matter what you create It matters what you create before anyone else So its not the beauty itself we admire Its not the force of intellect Its not invention aesthetics or capacity itself The greatest talent that we think a man can have He plucked one final string Seems to me that it must be nothing more than novelty The guards looked confused The gates shook Something pounded on them from outside The storm has come Wit said standing up The guards scrambled for spears left leaning beside the wall They had a guard house but it was empty they preferred the night air The gate shook again as if something enormous were outside The guards yelled calling to the men atop the wall All was chaos and confusion as the gate thumped yet a third time powerful shaking vibrating as if hit with a boulder And then a bright silvery blade rammed between the massive doors slicing upward cutting the bar that held them closed A Shardblade The gates swung open The guards scrambled back Wit waited on his boxes enthir held in one hand pack over his shoulder Outside the gates standing on the dark stone roadway was a solitary man with dark skin His hair was long and matted his clothing nothing more than a ragged sacklike length of cloth wrapping his waist He stood with head bowed wet ratty hair hanging down over his face and mixing with a beard that had bits of wood and leaves stuck in it His muscles glistened wet as if hed just swum a great distance To his side he carried a massive Shardblade point down sticking about a fingers width into the stone his hand on the hilt The Blade reflected torchlight it was long narrow and straight shaped like an enormous spike Welcome lost one Wit whispered Who are you one of the guards called nervous as one of the other two ran to give the alert A Shardbearer had come to Kholinar The figure ignored the question He stepped forward dragging his Shardblade as if it weighed a great deal It cut the rock behind him leaving a tiny groove in the stone The figure walked unsteadily and nearly tripped He steadied himself against the gate door and a lock of hair moved from the side of his face exposing his eyes Dark brown eyes like a man of the lower class Those eyes were wild dazed The man finally noticed the two guards who stood terrified with spears leveled at him He raised his empty hand toward them Go he said raggedly speaking perfect Alethi no hint of an accent Run Raise the call Give the warning Who are you one of the guards forced out What warning Who attacks The man paused He raised a hand to his head wavering Who am I I I am TalenelElin Stonesinew Herald of the Almighty The Desolation has come Oh God it has come And I have failed He slumped forward hitting the rocky ground Shardblade clattering down behind him It did not vanish The guards inched forward One prodded the man with the butt of his spear The man who had named himself a Herald did not move What is it we value Wit whispered Innovation Originality Novelty But most importantly timeliness I fear you may be too late my confused unfortunate friend THE END OF Book One of THE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE ENDNOTE Above silence the illuminating stormsdying storms illuminate the silence above The above sample is noteworthy as it is a ketek a complex form of holy Vorin poem The ketek not only reads the same forward and backward al lowing for alteration of verb forms but is also divisible into five distinct smaller sections each of which makes a complete thought The complete poem must form a sentence that is grammatically correct and theoretically poignant in meaning Because of the difficulty in constructing a ketek the structure was once considered the highest and most impressive form of all Vorin poetry The fact that this one was uttered by an illiterate dying Herdazian in a language he barely spoke should be of particular note There is no record of this particular ketek in any repository of Vorin poetry so it is very unlikely that the subject was merely repeating something he once heard None of the ardents we showed it to had any knowledge of it though three did praise its structure and ask to meet the poet We leave it to His Majestys mind on a strong day to puzzle out the meaning of why the storms might be important and what the poem may mean by indicating that there is silence both above and below said storms Joshor Head of His Majestys Silent Gatherers Tanatanev 1173 ARS ARCANUM THE TEN ESSENCES AND THEIR HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS The preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin symbolism associated with the Ten Essences Bound together these form the Double Eye of the Almighty an eye with two pupils representing the creation of plants and creatures This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was often associated with the Knights Radiant Ancient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this list alongside the Heralds themselves who each had a classical association with one of the numbers and Essences Im not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the Old Magic fit into this paradigm if indeed they can My research suggests that indeed there should be another series of abilities that is even more esoteric than the Voidbindings Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those though I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different ON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS Five groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far The methods of their creation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community but they appear to be the work of dedicated scientists as opposed to the more mystical Surgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant ALTERING FABRIALS Augmenters These fabrials are crafted to enhance something They can create heat pain or even a calm wind for instance They are poweredlike all fabrialsby Stormlight They seem to work best with forces emotions or sensations The socalled halfshards of Jah Keved are created with this type of fabrial attached to a sheet of metal enhancing its durability I have seen fabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone I am guessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work Diminishers These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do and generally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins Those artifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that even greater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far particularly in regard to augmenters and diminishers PAIRING FABRIALS Conjoiners By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not been revealed to me though I have my suspicions you can create a conjoined pair of gemstones The process requires splitting the original ruby The two halves will then create parallel reactions across a distance Spanreeds are one of the most common forms of this type of fabrial Conservation of force is maintained for instance if one is attached to a heavy stone you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial that you would need to lift the stone itself There appears to be some sort of process used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart the two halves can go and still produce an effect Reversers Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined halves of a gemstone but these two work in creating opposite reactions Raise one and the other will be pressed downward for instance These fabrials have only just been discovered and already the possibilities for exploitation are being conjectured There appear to be some unexpected limitations to this form of fabrial though I have not been able to discover what they are WARNING FABRIALS There is only one type of fabrial in this set informally known as the Alerter An Alerter can warn one of a nearby object feeling sensation or phenomenon These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus I do not know whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work or if there is another reason heliodor is used In the case of this kind of fabrial the amount of Stormlight you can infuse into it affects its range Hence the size of gemstone used is very important WINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS Reports of the Assassin in Whites odd abilities have led me to some sources of information that I believe are generally unknown The Windrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant and they made use of two primary types of Surgebinding The effects of these Surgebindings were knowncolloquially among the members of the orderas the Three Lashings BASIC LASHING GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE This type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings among the order though it was not the easiest to use That distinction belongs to the Full Lashing below A Basic Lashing involved revoking a beings or objects spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below instead temporarily linking that being or object to a different object or direction Effectively this creates a change in gravitational pull twisting the energies of the planet itself A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run up walls to send objects or people flying off into the air or to create similar effects Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to make himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward Mathematically binding a quarter of ones mass upward would halve a persons effective weight Binding half of ones mass upward would create weightlessness Multiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a persons body downward at double triple or other multiples of its weight FULL LASHING BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER A Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing but they worked on very different principles While one had to do with gravitation the other had to do with the force or Surge as the Radiants called them of adhesionbinding objects together as if they were one I believe this Surge may have had something to do with atmospheric pressure To create a Full Lashing a Windrunner would infuse an object with Stormlight then press another object to it The two objects would become bound together with an extremely powerful bond nearly impossible to break In fact most materials would themselves break before the bond holding them together would REVERSE LASHING GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL PULL I believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic Lashing This type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of any of the three Lashings The Windrunner would infuse something give a mental command and create a pull to the object that yanked other objects toward it At its heart this Lashing created a bubble around the object that imitated its spiritual link to the ground beneath it As such it was much harder for the Lashing to affect objects touching the ground where their link to the planet was strongest Objects falling or in flight were the easiest to influence Other objects could be affected but the Stormlight and skill required were much more substantial This is a
