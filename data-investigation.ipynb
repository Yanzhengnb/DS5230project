      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_68\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The last rider \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_71\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The Shade was \n",
      "already savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward \n",
      "the elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and \n",
      "tossed their heads. The riders stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then \n",
      "wheeled their mounts around and galloped away.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_72\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The lady’s horse \n",

      "behind the tree, raised his right hand, and shouted, “Garjzla!”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_73\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A red bolt \n",
      "flashed from his palm toward the elven lady, illuminating the trees with a \n",
      "bloody light. It struck her steed, and the horse toppled with a high-pitched \n",
      "squeal, plowing into the ground chest-first. She leapt off the animal with \n",
      "inhuman speed, landed lightly, then glanced back for her guards.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_74\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The Urgals’ \n",

      "Shade screamed, “After her! She is the one I want!” The monsters grunted and \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_75\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A cry tore from \n",

      "then cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_76\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">While the Urgals \n",
      "crashed through the trees, the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted \n",
      "above them. From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest. He \n",
      "raised his hand and uttered, “Böetq istalri!” and a quarter-mile section of the \n",
      "forest exploded into flames. Grimly he burned one section after another until \n",
      "there was a ring of fire, a half-league across, around the ambush site. The \n",
      "flames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest. Satisfied, he watched \n",
      "the ring carefully, in case it should falter.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_77\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The band of fire \n",
      "thickened, contracting the area the Urgals had to search. Suddenly, the Shade \n",
      "heard shouts and a coarse scream. Through the trees he saw three of his charges \n",
      "fall in a pile, mortally wounded. He caught a glimpse of the elf running from \n",
      "the remaining Urgals.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_78\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">She fled toward \n",
      "the craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed. The Shade examined the \n",
      "ground twenty feet below, then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her. She \n",
      "skidded around and sped back to the trail. Black Urgal blood dripped from her \n",
      "sword, staining the pouch in her hand.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_79\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The horned \n",
      "monsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in, blocking the only escape \n",
      "routes. Her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out. Seeing none, \n",
      "she drew herself up with regal disdain. The Shade approached her with a raised \n",
      "hand, allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_80\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Get her.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_81\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As the Urgals \n",
      "surged forward, the elf pulled open the pouch, reached into it, and then let it \n",
      "drop to the ground. In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the \n",
      "angry light of the fires. She raised it over her head, lips forming frantic \n",
      "words. Desperate, the Shade barked, “Garjzla!”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_82\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A ball of red \n",
      "flame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf, fast as an arrow. But he \n",
      "was too late. A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest, and the \n",
      "stone vanished. Then the red fire smote her and she collapsed.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_83\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The Shade howled \n",
      "in rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway \n",
      "through the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from \n",
      "his palm—which killed the Urgals instantly—then ripped his sword free and \n",
      "strode to the elf.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_84\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Prophecies of \n",

      "which would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed \n",
      "that the stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among \n",
      "the trees. After tying the elf onto the saddle, he mounted the charger and made \n",

      "Eragon’s return, a vicious blizzard blew out of the mountains and settled over \n",
      "the valley. The snow came down in great sheets, blanketing the countryside in \n",
      "white. They only dared leave the house for firewood and to feed the animals, \n",
      "for they feared getting lost in the howling wind and featureless landscape. \n",
      "They spent their time huddled over the stove as gusts rattled the heavy window \n",

      "Carvahall. But if they don’t show soon, we’ll have to buy any spare supplies \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_212\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">They grew \n",
      "anxious as the days crept by without sign of the traders. Talk was sparse, and \n",

      "morning, Roran walked to the road and confirmed that the traders had not yet \n",
      "passed. The day was spent readying for the trip into Carvahall, scrounging with \n",
      "grim expressions for saleable items. That evening, out of desperation, Eragon \n",
      "checked the road again. He found deep ruts cut into the snow, with numerous \n",
      "hoofprints between them. Elated, he ran back to the house whooping, bringing \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_217\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">In daylight, it \n",

      "and fires were randomly spread across it, spots of color against the snow. The \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_218\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Crowds churned \n",
      "around a line of bright tents and booths clogging the main street. Horses \n",
      "whinnied at the noise. The snow had been pounded flat, giving it a glassy \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_219\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Garrow parked \n",

      "yourselves some treats. Roran, do what you want, only be at Horst’s in time for \n",
      "supper. Eragon, bring that stone and come with me.” Eragon grinned at Roran and \n",
      "pocketed the money, already planning how to spend it.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_220\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Roran departed \n",
      "immediately with a determined expression on his face. Garrow led Eragon into \n",
      "the throng, shouldering his way through the bustle. Women were buying cloth, \n",
      "while nearby their husbands examined a new latch, hook, or tool. Children ran \n",
      "up and down the road, shrieking with excitement. Knives were displayed here, \n",
      "spices there, and pots were laid out in shiny rows next to leather harnesses.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_221\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon stared at \n",
      "the traders curiously. They seemed less prosperous than last year. Their \n",
      "children had a frightened, wary look, and their clothes were patched. The gaunt \n",
      "men carried swords and daggers with a new familiarity, and even the women had \n",
      "poniards belted at their waists.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_222\"><i><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">What could have \n",
      "happened to make them like this? And why are they so late?</span></i><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">wondered Eragon. \n",
      "He remembered the traders as being full of good cheer, but there was none of \n",
      "that now. Garrow pushed down the street, searching for Merlock, a trader who \n",
      "specialized in odd trinkets and pieces of jewelry.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_223\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">They found him \n",
      "behind a booth, displaying brooches to a group of women. As each new piece was \n",
      "revealed, exclamations of admiration followed. Eragon guessed that more than a \n",
      "few purses would soon be depleted. Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every \n",
      "time his wares were complimented. He wore a goatee, held himself with ease, and \n",
      "seemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_224\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The excited \n",
      "group prevented Garrow and Eragon from getting near the trader, so they settled \n",
      "on a step and waited. As soon as Merlock was unoccupied, they hurried over.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_225\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“And what might \n",
      "you sirs want to look at?” asked Merlock. “An amulet or trinket for a lady?” \n",
      "With a twirl he pulled out a delicately carved silver rose of excellent \n",
      "workmanship. The polished metal caught Eragon’s attention, and he eyed it \n",
      "appreciatively. The trader continued, “Not even three crowns, though it has \n",
      "come all the way from the famed craftsmen of Belatona.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_226\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Garrow spoke in \n",
      "a quiet voice. “We aren’t looking to buy, but to sell.” Merlock immediately \n",
      "covered the rose and looked at them with new interest.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_227\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“I see. Maybe, \n",
      "if this item is of any value, you would like to trade it for one or two of \n",
      "these exquisite pieces.” He paused for a moment while Eragon and his uncle \n",
      "stood uncomfortably, then continued, “You did<i>bring</i> the object of \n",
      "consideration?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_228\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“We have it, but \n",
      "we would rather show it to you elsewhere,” said Garrow in a firm voice.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_229\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Merlock raised \n",
      "an eyebrow, but spoke smoothly. “In that case, let me invite you to my tent.” \n",
      "He gathered up his wares and gently laid them in an iron-bound chest, which he \n",
      "locked. Then he ushered them up the street and into the temporary camp. They \n",
      "wound between the wagons to a tent removed from the rest of the traders’. It \n",
      "was crimson at the top and sable at the bottom, with thin triangles of colors \n",
      "stabbing into each other. Merlock untied the opening and swung the flap to one \n",
      "side.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_230\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Small trinkets \n",
      "and strange pieces of furniture, such as a round bed and three seats carved \n",
      "from tree stumps, filled the tent. A gnarled dagger with a ruby in the pommel \n",
      "rested on a white cushion.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_231\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Merlock closed \n",
      "the flap and turned to them. “Please, seat yourselves.” When they had, he said, \n",
      "“Now show me why we are meeting in private.” Eragon unwrapped the stone and set \n",
      "it between the two men. Merlock reached for it with a gleam in his eye, then \n",
      "stopped and asked, “May I?” When Garrow indicated his approval, Merlock picked \n",
      "it up.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_232\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He put the stone \n",
      "in his lap and reached to one side for a thin box. Opened, it revealed a large \n",
      "set of copper scales, which he set on the ground. After weighing the stone, he \n",
      "scrutinized its surface under a jeweler’s glass, tapped it gently with a wooden \n",
      "mallet, and drew the point of a tiny clear stone over it. He measured its \n",
      "length and diameter, then recorded the figures on a slate. He considered the \n",
      "results for a while. “Do you know what this is worth?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_233\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“No,” admitted \n",
      "Garrow. His cheek twitched, and he shifted uncomfortably on the seat.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_234\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Merlock \n",
      "grimaced. “Unfortunately, neither do I. But I can tell you this much: the white \n",
      "veins are the same material as the blue that surrounds them, only a different \n",
      "color. What that material might be, though, I haven’t a clue. It’s harder than \n",
      "any rock I have seen, harder even than diamond. Whoever shaped it used tools I \n",
      "have never seen—or magic. Also, it’s hollow.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_235\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“What?” \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_236\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">An irritated \n",
      "edge crept into Merlock’s voice. “Did you ever hear a rock sound like this?” He \n",
      "grabbed the dagger from the cushion and slapped the stone with the flat of the \n",
      "blade. A pure note filled the air, then faded away smoothly. Eragon was \n",
      "alarmed, afraid that the stone had been damaged. Merlock tilted the stone \n",
      "toward them. “You will find no scratches or blemishes where the dagger struck. \n",
      "I doubt I could do anything to harm this stone, even if I took a hammer to it.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_237\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Garrow crossed \n",
      "his arms with a reserved expression. A wall of silence surrounded him. Eragon \n",
      "was puzzled.<i>I knew that the stone appeared in the Spine through magic, but \n",
      "made by magic? What for and why?</i> He blurted, “But what is it worth?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_238\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“I can’t tell \n",
      "you that,” said Merlock in a pained voice. “I am sure there are people who \n",
      "would pay dearly to have it, but none of them are in Carvahall. You would have \n",
      "to go to the southern cities to find a buyer. This is a curiosity for most \n",
      "people—not an item to spend money on when practical things are needed.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_239\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Garrow stared at \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_240\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The trader \n",
      "answered instantly, “It’s not worth the risk. I might be able to find a wealthy \n",
      "buyer during my spring travels, but I can’t be certain. Even if I did, you \n",
      "wouldn’t be paid until I returned next year. No, you will have to find someone \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_241\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon put the \n",

      "meager supply of coins. When he talked with the merchants, they confirmed what \n",
      "Merlock had said about the instability in Alagaësia. Over and over the message \n",

      "time it solidified into a tendril of thought through which he could feel a \n",
      "growing curiosity. It was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had \n",
      "fallen away, and he was now free to reach out with his mind. He was afraid that \n",
      "without anything to hold him back, he would float out of his body and be unable \n",
      "to return, becoming a spirit of the ether. Scared, he pulled away from the \n",
      "contact. The new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes. He glared \n",

      "again. Puzzled, he rubbed the dragon’s head with his right hand. A light \n",
      "tingling ran up his arm. The dragon nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat. \n",

      "animal, of that he was sure. Yet it seemed so helpless crawling on his bed, he \n",
      "could only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it. The dragon wailed in a \n",

      "watching the moon. He cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the \n",
      "dragon. It smelled the square cautiously, then jabbed its head forward like a \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_331\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He fed it, \n",

      "square left, the dragon’s belly was bulging. He proffered the last piece; the \n",
      "dragon considered it for a moment, then lazily snapped it up. Done eating, it \n",
      "crawled onto his arm and curled against his chest. Then it snorted, a puff of \n",

      "Gently, he carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow. The dragon, eyes \n",
      "closed, wrapped its tail around the bedpost contentedly. Eragon lay next to it, \n",

      "painful dilemma: By raising a dragon, he could become a Rider. Myths and \n",
      "stories about Riders were treasured, and being one would automatically place \n",
      "him among those legends. However, if the Empire discovered the dragon, he and \n",
      "his family would be put to death unless he joined the king. No one could—or \n",
      "would—help them. The simplest solution was just to kill the dragon, but the \n",
      "idea was repugnant, and he rejected it. Dragons were too revered for him to \n",
      "even consider that.<i>Besides, what could betray us?</i> he thought.<i>We live \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_334\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The problem was \n",

      "care to have a dragon around.<i>I could raise it in secret. In a month or two \n",
      "it will be too large for Garrow to get rid of, but will he accept it? Even if \n",
      "he does, can I get enough food for the dragon while it’s hiding? It’s no larger \n",
      "than a small cat, but it ate an entire handful of meat! I suppose it’ll be able \n",
      "to hunt for itself eventually, but how long until then? Will it be able to \n",
      "survive the cold outside?</i> All the same, he wanted the dragon. The more he \n",
      "thought about it, the surer he was. However things might work out with Garrow, \n",
      "Eragon would do everything he could to protect it. Determined, he fell asleep \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_335\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">When dawn came, \n",
      "the dragon was sitting atop his bedpost, like an ancient sentinel welcoming the \n",
      "new day. Eragon marveled at its color. He had never seen such a clear, hard \n",
      "blue. Its scales were like hundreds of small gemstones. He noticed that the \n",
      "white oval on his palm, where he had touched the dragon, had a silvery sheen. \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_336\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The dragon \n",
      "launched off the post and glided to the floor. Eragon gingerly picked it up and \n",
      "left the quiet house, pausing to grab meat, several leather strips, and as many \n",
      "rags as he could carry. The crisp morning was beautiful; a fresh layer of snow \n",
      "covered the farm. He smiled as the small creature looked around with interest \n",
      "from the safety of his arms.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_337\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Hurrying across \n",
      "the fields, he walked silently into the dark forest, searching for a safe place \n",
      "for the dragon to stay. Eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a \n",
      "barren knoll, its branches snow-tipped gray fingers that reached toward the \n",
      "sky. He set the dragon down by the base of the trunk and shook the leather onto \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_338\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">With a few deft \n",

      "the snowy clumps surrounding the tree. The leather was worn, but it would hold. \n",
      "He watched the dragon crawl around, then untied the noose from its neck and \n",
      "fashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the dragon would not strangle \n",
      "itself. Next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the \n",
      "branches, layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat. Snow fell on his \n",
      "face as the tree swayed. He hung more rags over the front of the shelter to \n",

      "he focused on the dragon and tried to impress on it one idea:<i>Stay here.</i> \n",
      "The dragon stopped moving and cocked its head at him. He pushed harder:<i>Stay \n",

      "enthusiasm made the day go by quickly. The mark on his hand proved easy to \n",
      "hide, so he soon stopped worrying about it. Before long he headed back to the \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_344\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">His fears were \n",
      "groundless. The dragon was perched on a branch, gnawing on something between \n",
      "its front legs. It started squeaking excitedly when it saw him. He was pleased \n",
      "to see that it had remained in the tree, above the reach of large predators. As \n",
      "soon as he dropped the sausages at the base of the trunk, the dragon glided \n",
      "down. While it voraciously tore apart the food, Eragon examined the shelter. \n",
      "All the meat he had left was gone, but the hut was intact, and tufts of \n",
      "feathers littered the floor.<i>Good. It can get its own food.</i><p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_345\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">It struck him \n",
      "that he did not know if the dragon was a he or a she. He lifted and turned it \n",
      "over, ignoring its squeals of displeasure, but was unable to find any \n",
      "distinguishing marks.<i>It seems like it won’t give up any secrets without a struggle.</i><p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_346\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He spent a long \n",
      "time with the dragon. He untied it, set it on his shoulder, and went to explore \n",
      "the woods. The snow-laden trees watched over them like solemn pillars of a \n",
      "great cathedral. In that isolation, Eragon showed the dragon what he knew about \n",
      "the forest, not caring if it understood his meaning. It was the simple act of \n",
      "sharing that mattered. He talked to it continuously. The dragon gazed back at \n",
      "him with bright eyes, drinking in his words. For a while he just sat with it \n",
      "resting in his arms and watched it with wonder, still stunned by recent events. \n",
      "Eragon started for home at sunset, conscious of two hard blue eyes drilling \n",
      "into his back, indignant at being left behind.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_347\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">That night he \n",
      "brooded about all the things that could happen to a small and unprotected \n",
      "animal. Thoughts of ice storms and vicious animals tormented him. It took hours \n",
      "for him to find sleep. His dreams were of foxes and black wolves tearing at the \n",
      "dragon with bloody teeth.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_348\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">In the sunrise \n",
      "glow, Eragon ran from the house with food and scraps of cloth—extra insulation \n",
      "for the shelter. He found the dragon awake and safe, watching the sunrise from \n",
      "high in the tree. He fervently thanked all the gods, known and unknown. The \n",
      "dragon came down to the ground as he approached and leapt into his arms, \n",
      "huddling close to his chest. The cold had not harmed it, but it seemed \n",
      "frightened. A puff of dark smoke blew out of its nostrils. He stroked it \n",
      "comfortingly and sat with his back to the rowan, murmuring softly. He kept \n",
      "still as the dragon buried its head in his coat. After a while it crawled out \n",
      "of his embrace and onto his shoulder. He fed it, then wrapped the new rags \n",
      "around the hut. They played together for a time, but Eragon had to return to \n",
      "the house before long.<p/></span></p> \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_350\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A smooth routine \n",
      "was quickly established. Every morning Eragon ran out to the tree and gave the \n",
      "dragon breakfast before hurrying back. During the day he attacked his chores \n",
      "until they were finished and he could visit the dragon again. Both Garrow and \n",
      "Roran noted his behavior and asked why he spent so much time outside. Eragon \n",
      "just shrugged and started checking to make sure he was not followed to the \n",
      "tree.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_351\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">After the first \n",
      "few days he stopped worrying that a mishap would befall the dragon. Its growth \n",
      "was explosive; it would soon be safe from most dangers. The dragon doubled in \n",
      "size in the first week. Four days later it was as high as his knee. It no \n",
      "longer fit inside the hut in the rowan, so Eragon was forced to build a hidden \n",
      "shelter on the ground. The task took him three days.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_352\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">When the dragon \n",
      "was a fortnight old, Eragon was compelled to let it roam free because it needed \n",
      "so much food. The first time he untied it, only the force of his will kept it \n",
      "from following him back to the farm. Every time it tried, he pushed it away \n",
      "with his mind until it learned to avoid the house and its other inhabitants.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_353\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">And he impressed \n",
      "on the dragon the importance of hunting only in the Spine, where there was less \n",
      "chance of being seen. Farmers would notice if game started disappearing from \n",
      "Palancar Valley. It made him feel both safer and uneasy when the dragon was so \n",
      "far away.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_354\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The mental \n",
      "contact he shared with the dragon waxed stronger each day. He found that \n",
      "although it did not comprehend words, he could communicate with it through \n",
      "images or emotions. It was an imprecise method, however, and he was often \n",
      "misunderstood. The range at which they could touch each other’s thoughts \n",
      "expanded rapidly. Soon Eragon could contact the dragon anywhere within three \n",
      "leagues. He often did so, and the dragon, in turn, would lightly brush against \n",
      "his mind. These mute conversations filled his working hours. There was always a \n",
      "small part of him connected to the dragon, ignored at times, but never \n",
      "forgotten. When he talked with people, the contact was distracting, like a fly \n",
      "buzzing in his ear.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_355\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As the dragon \n",
      "matured, its squeaks deepened to a roar and the humming became a low rumble, \n",
      "yet the dragon did not breathe fire, which concerned him. He had seen it blow \n",
      "smoke when it was upset, but there was never a hint of flame.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_356\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">When the month \n",
      "ended, Eragon’s elbow was level with the dragon’s shoulder. In that brief span, \n",
      "it had transformed from a small, weak animal into a powerful beast. Its hard \n",
      "scales were as tough as chain-mail armor, its teeth like daggers.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_357\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon took long \n",
      "walks in the evening with the dragon padding beside him. When they found a \n",
      "clearing, he would settle against a tree and watch the dragon soar through the \n",
      "air. He loved to see it fly and regretted that it was not yet big enough to \n",
      "ride. He often sat beside the dragon and rubbed its neck, feeling sinews and \n",
      "corded muscles flex under his hands.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_358\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Despite Eragon’s \n",
      "efforts, the forest around the farm filled with signs of the dragon’s \n",
      "existence. It was impossible to erase all the huge four-clawed footprints sunk \n",
      "deep in the snow, and he refused even to try to hide the giant dung heaps that \n",
      "were becoming far too common. The dragon had rubbed against trees, stripping \n",
      "off the bark, and had sharpened its claws on dead logs, leaving gashes inches \n",
      "deep. If Garrow or Roran went too far beyond the farm’s boundaries, they would \n",
      "discover the dragon. Eragon could imagine no worse way for the truth to come \n",
      "out, so he decided to preempt it by explaining everything to them.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_359\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He wanted to do \n",
      "two things first, though: give the dragon a suitable name and learn more about \n",
      "dragons in general. To that end he needed to talk with Brom, master of epics \n",
      "and legends—the only places where dragonlore survived.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_360\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">So when Roran \n",
      "went to get a chisel repaired in Carvahall, Eragon volunteered to go with him.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_361\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\"> <p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_362\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The evening \n",
      "before they left, Eragon went to a small clearing in the forest and called the \n",
      "dragon with his mind. After a moment he saw a fast-moving speck in the dusky \n",
      "sky. The dragon dived toward him, pulled up sharply, then leveled off above the \n",
      "trees. He heard a low-pitched whistle as air rushed over its wings. It banked \n",
      "slowly to his left and spiraled gently down to the ground. The dragon \n",
      "back-flapped for balance with a deep, muffled<i>thwump</i> as it landed.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_363\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon opened \n",
      "his mind, still uncomfortable with the strange sensation, and told the dragon \n",
      "that he was leaving. It snorted with unease. He attempted to soothe it with a \n",
      "calming mental picture, but the dragon whipped its tail, unsatisfied. He rested \n",
      "his hand on its shoulder and tried to radiate peace and serenity. Scales bumped \n",
      "under his fingers as he patted it gently.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_364\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A single word \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_366\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">It was solemn \n",
      "and sad, as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed. He stared at the dragon \n",
      "and a cold tingle ran down his arm.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "watched it lick the underside of the kettle. “If you must know, elves are not \n",
      "legends, and they are called the fair folk because they are more graceful than \n",

      "from under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more \n",
      "interruptions, “the elves were a proud race then, and strong in magic. At first \n",
      "they regarded dragons as mere animals. From that belief rose a deadly mistake. \n",
      "A brash elven youth hunted down a dragon, as he would a stag, and killed it. \n",
      "Outraged, the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf. Unfortunately, the \n",
      "bloodletting did not stop there. The dragons massed together and attacked the \n",
      "entire elven nation. Dismayed by the terrible misunderstanding, the elves tried \n",
      "to end the hostilities, but couldn’t find a way to communicate with the \n",
      "dragons.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_391\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Thus, to \n",
      "greatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences, there was a very long \n",
      "and very bloody war, which both sides later regretted. At the beginning the \n",
      "elves fought only to defend themselves, for they were reluctant to escalate the \n",
      "fighting, but the dragons’ ferocity eventually forced them to attack for their \n",
      "own survival. This lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer \n",
      "if an elf called Eragon hadn’t found a dragon egg.” Eragon blinked in surprise. \n",
      "“Ah, I see you didn’t know of your namesake,” said Brom.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "fire and poured boiling water into two cups. Handing one to Eragon, he warned, \n",
      "“These leaves don’t need to steep long, so drink it quickly before it gets too \n",
      "strong.” Eragon tried a sip, but scalded his tongue. Brom set his own cup aside \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_394\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“No one knows \n",

      "attack. Others believe the dragons purposefully left it there. Either way, \n",
      "Eragon saw the value of raising a friendly dragon. He cared for it secretly \n",
      "and, in the custom of the ancient language, named him Bid’Daum. When Bid’Daum \n",
      "had grown to a good size, they traveled together among the dragons and \n",
      "convinced them to live in peace with the elves. Treaties were formed between \n",
      "the two races. To ensure that war would never break out again, they decided \n",

      "to serve him, but only the twisted dragons of the Forsworn would assist his \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_425\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom did not \n",
      "respond at once. His chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe \n",
      "thoughtfully, light reflecting off his ring. “Sorry, my mind was elsewhere. \n",
      "Yes, a dragon will live for quite a while, forever, in fact, as long as it \n",

      "only live to be sixty or seventy. You said during your . . . narration that \n",
      "Riders lived for hundreds of years, but that’s impossible.” It troubled him to \n",

      "matter of perspective. You must be very wise to know so much at such a young \n",
      "age.” Eragon flushed, and the old man chuckled. “Don’t be angry; you can’t be \n",
      "expected to know such things. You forget that the dragons were magical—they \n",
      "affected everything around them in strange ways. The Riders were closest to \n",
      "them and experienced this the most. The most common side effect was an extended \n",
      "life. Our king has lived long enough to make that apparent, but most people \n",
      "attribute it to his own magical abilities. There were also other, less \n",
      "noticeable changes. All the Riders were stronger of body, keener of mind, and \n",
      "truer of sight than normal men. Along with this, a human Rider would slowly \n",

      "think you had made a mistake. If that were so, it would be most . . . \n",
      "unpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do. Would \n",

      "soundlessly from the sheath. The flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in \n",
      "the firelight. The keen edges curved gracefully to a sharp point. A duplicate \n",
      "of the black symbol was inscribed on the metal. The balance of the sword was \n",
      "perfect; it felt like an extension of his arm, unlike the rude farm tools he \n",
      "was used to. An air of power lay over it, as if an unstoppable force resided in \n",
      "its core. It had been created for the violent convulsions of battle, to end men’s \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_889\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“This was once a \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_891\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“It doesn’t \n",

      "dragon if they have the proper training. And,” he raised a finger for emphasis, \n",
      "“it doesn’t mean anything if they can. I know more about the dragons and their \n",
      "abilities than almost anyone else alive. On your own it might take years to \n",

      "the blade and showed her the sword.<i>It has power,</i> she said, touching the \n",
      "point with her nose. The metal’s iridescent color rippled like water as it met \n",
      "her scales. She lifted her head with a satisfied snort, and the sword resumed \n",

      "amaze you. Things . . . happen around them, mysterious things that are \n",
      "impossible anywhere else. Even though the Riders worked with dragons for \n",
      "centuries, they never completely understood their abilities. Some say that even \n",
      "the dragons don’t know the full extent of their own powers. They are linked \n",
      "with this land in a way that lets them overcome great obstacles. What Saphira \n",

      "to have something resembling a beak and black eyes as large as my fist—though \n",
      "how they manage our speech is a mystery to me. Doubtless the rest of their \n",
      "bodies are just as twisted. That is why they cover themselves with cloaks at \n",

      "they cannot use magic. Be thankful for that, because if they could, you would \n",
      "already be in their grasp. I also know they have a strong aversion to sunlight, \n",

      "Perhaps they’re the last of a dying race. You see, they are the king’s personal \n",
      "dragon hunters. Whenever rumors reach Galbatorix of a dragon in the land, he \n",
      "sends the Ra’zac to investigate. A trail of death often follows them.” Brom \n",
      "blew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles. \n",

      "Spine. It felt wonderful to finally confide in someone. Brom asked a few \n",
      "questions, but most of the time he listened intently. The sun was about to set \n",
      "when Eragon finished his tale. Both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a \n",
      "soft pink. Eragon eventually broke the silence. “I just wish I knew where she \n",

      "head. “I don’t know. . . . You’ve made many things clear to me. I am sure that \n",
      "no one besides us has seen Saphira. The Ra’zac must have had a source of \n",

      "Ra’zac’s camp after dark, trying to learn what I could, when they surprised me \n",
      "in the shadows. It was a good trap, but they underestimated me, and I managed \n",
      "to drive them away. Not, however,” he said wryly, “without this token of my \n",
      "stupidity. Stunned, I fell to the ground and didn’t regain consciousness until \n",
      "the next day. By then they had already arrived at your farm. It was too late to \n",

      "from you and, once they had left, confront you about Saphira. But they \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_922\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Mmm,” said \n",
      "Brom, moving forward. “Well, dragons used to have two kinds of saddles. The \n",
      "first was hard and molded like a horse’s saddle. But those take time and tools \n",
      "to make, neither of which we have. The other was thin and lightly padded, \n",
      "nothing more than an extra layer between the Rider and dragon. Those saddles \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_926\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Very well, but \n",
      "pay attention. Someday you may have to do this for yourself.” With Saphira’s \n",
      "permission, Brom measured her neck and chest. Then he cut five bands out of the \n",
      "leather and outlined a dozen or so shapes on the hides. Once the pieces had \n",

      "cords to sew everything together, but for each stitch, two holes had to be \n",
      "bored through the leather. Eragon helped with that. Intricate knots were rigged \n",
      "in place of buckles, and every strap was made extra long so the saddle would \n",
      "still fit Saphira in the coming months.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "padding between them. Attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit \n",
      "snugly around one of Saphira’s neck spikes, while wide bands sewn on either \n",
      "side would wrap around her belly and tie underneath. Taking the place of \n",
      "stirrups were a series of loops running down both bands. Tightened, they would \n",
      "hold Eragon’s legs in place. A long strap was constructed to pass between \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_934\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Dinner was made \n",
      "quickly. It tasted good even though it was simple. While they ate, Brom looked \n",
      "over the fire at Eragon and asked, “Will we leave tomorrow?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_935\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“There isn’t any \n",

      "I never wished for this to happen. Your family did not deserve such a tragedy. \n",
      "If there were anything I could do to reverse it, I would. This is a terrible \n",
      "situation for all of us.” Eragon sat in silence, avoiding Brom’s gaze, then \n",
      "Brom said, “We’re going to need horses.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_937\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Maybe you do, \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_938\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom shook his \n",
      "head. “There isn’t a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon, and Saphira \n",
      "is too young to carry us both. Besides, it’ll be safer if we stay together, and \n",
      "riding is faster than walking.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_939\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“But that’ll \n",
      "make it harder to catch the Ra’zac,” protested Eragon. “On Saphira, I could \n",
      "probably find them within a day or two. On horses, it’ll take much longer—if \n",
      "it’s even possible to overtake their lead on the ground!”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_940\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom said \n",
      "slowly, “That’s a chance you’ll have to take if I’m to accompany you.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_941\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon thought \n",
      "it over. “All right,” he grumbled, “we’ll get horses. But you have to buy them. \n",
      "I don’t have any money, and I don’t want to steal again. It’s wrong.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_942\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“That depends on \n",
      "your point of view,” corrected Brom with a slight smile. “Before you set out on \n",
      "this venture, remember that your enemies, the Ra’zac, are the king’s servants. \n",
      "They will be protected wherever they go. Laws do not stop them. In cities \n",
      "they’ll have access to abundant resources and willing servants. Also keep in \n",
      "mind that nothing is more important to Galbatorix than recruiting or killing \n",
      "you—though word of your existence probably hasn’t reached him yet. The longer \n",
      "you evade the Ra’zac, the more desperate he’ll become. He’ll know that every \n",
      "day you’ll be growing stronger and that each passing moment will give you \n",
      "another chance to join his enemies. You must be very careful, as you may easily \n",
      "turn from the hunter into the hunted.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_943\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon was \n",
      "subdued by the strong words. Pensive, he rolled a twig between his fingers. \n",
      "“Enough talk,” said Brom. “It’s late and my bones ache. We can say more \n",
      "tomorrow.” Eragon nodded and banked the fire.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "However, once they formed an alliance with the elves, a certain number of their \n",
      "eggs, usually no more than one or two, were given to the Riders each year. \n",

      "destined to be its Rider came into their presence—though how they sensed that \n",

      "his lecture. He explained what and when dragons ate. A fully grown sedentary \n",
      "dragon could go for months without food, but in mating season they had to eat \n",
      "every week. Some plants could heal their sicknesses, while others would make \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_959\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He explained the \n",
      "techniques to use when attacking from a dragon and what to do if you were \n",
      "fighting one, whether on foot, horseback, or with another dragon. Their bellies \n",
      "were armored; their armpits were not. Eragon constantly interrupted to ask \n",

      "welcoming the warmth. Brom sat on the other side of the fire, whittling two \n",
      "long sticks. He suddenly threw one at Eragon, who grabbed it out of reflex as \n",

      "the stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a \n",
      "sword. Brom wanted to fight him? What chance did the old man stand?<i>If he \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_973\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He rose as Brom \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_974\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Without \n",

      "the stick toward Brom’s head, twisted it at the last moment, and then tried to \n",
      "hit his side. The solid smack of wood striking wood resounded through the camp. \n",
      "“Improvisation—good!” exclaimed Brom, eyes gleaming. His arm moved in a blur, \n",
      "and there was an explosion of pain on the side of Eragon’s head. He collapsed \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_975\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">A splash of cold \n",
      "water roused him to alertness, and he sat up, sputtering. His head was ringing, \n",
      "and there was dried blood on his face. Brom stood over him with a pan of melted \n",
      "snow water. “You didn’t have to do that,” said Eragon angrily, pushing himself \n",

      "Should I pander to your . . . incompetence so you’ll feel better? I don’t think \n",
      "so.” He picked up the stick that Eragon had dropped and held it out. “Now, \n",

      "paused to show Eragon exactly how to execute a certain move. “Do it again, but \n",
      "this time<i>slowly</i> !” They slid through the forms with exaggerated motions \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_982\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He felt even \n",
      "worse the next day. Bruises covered his arms, and he was almost too sore to \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_989\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As the ruts in \n",
      "the road deepened, Eragon noticed more footprints. Farms signaled their \n",
      "approach to Therinsford. The village was larger than Carvahall, but it had been \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_990\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“What a mess,” \n",
      "said Eragon. He could not see Dempton’s mill.<i>Baldor and Albriech have surely \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_991\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“It’s ugly, if \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_992\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The Anora River \n",
      "flowed between them and the town, spanned by a stout bridge. As they approached \n",
      "it, a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way. His shirt was \n",
      "too short, and his dirty stomach spilled over a rope belt. Behind his cracked \n",
      "lips, his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones. “You c’n stop right there. \n",
      "This’s my bridge. Gotta pay t’ get over.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_993\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“How much?” \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_994\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Five crowns,” \n",
      "he said, pulling his lips into a broad smile. Eragon’s temper flared at the \n",
      "exorbitant price, and he started to complain hotly, but Brom silenced him with \n",
      "a quick look. The coins were wordlessly handed over. The man put them into a \n",
      "sack hanging from his belt. “Thank’ee much,” he said in a mocking tone, and \n",
      "stood out of the way.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_995\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As Brom stepped \n",

      "“Watch y’re step,” snarled the grimy man, sidling away.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_996\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Sorry,” \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1000\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Because you can’t \n",
      "argue with all of the fools in the world. It’s easier to let them have their \n",
      "way, then trick them when they’re not paying attention.” Brom opened his hand, \n",
      "and a pile of coins glinted in the light.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1001\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“You cut his \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1002\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom pocketed \n",
      "the money with a wink. “And it held a surprising amount. He should know better \n",
      "than to keep all these coins in one place.” There was a sudden howl of anguish \n",
      "from the other side of the river. “I’d say our friend has just discovered his \n",
      "loss. If you see any watchmen, tell me.” He grabbed the shoulder of a young boy \n",
      "running between the houses and asked, “Do you know where we can buy horses?” \n",
      "The child stared at them with solemn eyes, then pointed to a large barn near \n",
      "the edge of Therinsford. “Thank you,” said Brom, tossing him a small coin.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1003\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The barn’s large \n",
      "double doors were open, revealing two long rows of stalls. The far wall was \n",
      "covered with saddles, harnesses, and other paraphernalia. A man with muscular \n",
      "arms stood at the end, brushing a white stallion. He raised a hand and beckoned \n",
      "for them to come over.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1004\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As they \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1005\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Yes indeed. His \n",
      "name’s Snowfire. Mine’s Haberth.” Haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands \n",
      "vigorously with Eragon and Brom. There was a polite pause as he waited for \n",
      "their names in return. When they were not forthcoming, he asked, “Can I help \n",
      "you?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1006\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom nodded. “We \n",
      "need two horses and a full set of tack for both. The horses have to be fast and \n",
      "tough; we’ll be doing a lot of traveling.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1007\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Haberth was \n",
      "thoughtful for a moment. “I don’t have many animals like that, and the ones I \n",
      "do aren’t cheap.” The stallion moved restlessly; he calmed it with a few \n",
      "strokes of his fingers.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1008\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“Price is no \n",
      "object. I’ll take the best you have,” said Brom. Haberth nodded and silently \n",
      "tied the stallion to a stall. He went to the wall and started pulling down \n",
      "saddles and other items. Soon he had two identical piles. Next he walked up the \n",
      "line of stalls and brought out two horses. One was a light bay, the other a roan. \n",
      "The bay tugged against his rope.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1009\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“He’s a little \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1010\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom let the \n",
      "horse smell his hand; it allowed him to rub its neck. “We’ll take him,” he \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1015\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon tried to \n",
      "put his hand on the bay like Brom had, but it shied away. He automatically \n",
      "reached out with his mind to reassure the horse, stiffening with surprise as he \n",
      "touched the animal’s consciousness. The contact was not clear or sharp like it \n",
      "was with Saphira, but he could communicate with the bay to a limited degree. \n",
      "Tentatively, he made it understand that he was a friend. The horse calmed and \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1016\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Haberth used his \n",
      "fingers to add up the price of the purchase. “Two hundred crowns and no less,” \n",

      "Its peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight, towering over the lesser \n",

      "gentle pace. Before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields \n",
      "yielded to wilder land. Brambles and tangled weeds lined the road, along with \n",
      "huge rosebushes that clung to their clothes. Tall rocks slanted out of the \n",

      "furrowed with snowy canyons. The black rock of the mountain absorbed light like \n",
      "a sponge and dimmed the surrounding area. Between Utgard and the line of \n",
      "mountains that formed the east side of Palancar Valley was a deep cleft. It was \n",

      "has lasted since their founding. That was where Vrael took refuge, and where, \n",
      "through treachery, he was found and defeated by Galbatorix. When Vrael fell, \n",
      "this area was tainted. Edoc’sil, ‘Unconquerable,’ was the name of this bastion, \n",

      "was by the relentless pull of time. It struck him then just how old the Riders \n",

      "entered the breach that divided the mountain range. Eragon stood in his \n",
      "stirrups; he was impatient to see what lay outside of Palancar, but it was \n",
      "still too far away. For a while they were in a sloped pass, winding over hill \n",
      "and gully, following the Anora River. Then, with the sun low behind their \n",

      "nomad tribes that roam this section of the plains, it’s almost as uninhabited \n",
      "as the Hadarac Desert to the east. So we aren’t going to find many villages. \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1042\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">They left the \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1043\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon \n",

      "Snowfire, but maybe this will do.” He placed his hand on the bay and said, “I \n",
      "name you Cadoc. It was my grandfather’s name, so bear it well.” Brom nodded in \n",

      "spell out exactly what they want to happen. As they gain more experience, it \n",
      "isn’t as necessary. A true master could just say<i>water</i> and create \n",

      "he felt something different—a small bump that was a part of him and yet not of \n",
      "him. Excited, he dug into it, seeking what it hid. He felt resistance, a \n",
      "barrier in his mind, but knew that the power lay on the other side. He tried to \n",

      "followed the same pattern. First, Eragon struggled to learn the ancient words \n",
      "and to manipulate the pebble. Then, in the evening, he trained against Brom \n",
      "with the fake swords. Eragon was in constant discomfort, but he gradually began \n",
      "to change, almost without noticing. Soon the pebble no longer wobbled when he \n",

      "horses now, and much longer. Because of her size and the way her scales \n",
      "sparkled, she was altogether too visible. Brom and Eragon worried about it, but \n",

      "outer wall were breached, archers would be posted on all the roofs. Because the \n",
      "houses in the front, by the outer wall, are lower, the men farther back could \n",
      "shoot over them without fear of hitting their comrades. Also, if the enemy were \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1560\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">At the sight of \n",

      "mouth opened and closed several times like a gasping fish. He asked softly, in \n",
      "an incredulous voice, “Brom . . . ?”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1561\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom put a \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1562\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Jeod looked \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1567\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">There was a \n",
      "rapier at Jeod’s side when he reappeared. An embroidered jacket hung loosely on \n",
      "his shoulders, matched by a plumed hat. Brom cast a critical eye at the finery, \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1568\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He took them \n",
      "through Teirm toward the citadel. Eragon led the horses behind the two men. \n",
      "Jeod gestured at their destination. “Risthart, the lord of Teirm, has decreed \n",
      "that all the business owners must have their headquarters in his castle. Even \n",
      "though most of us conduct our business elsewhere, we still have to rent rooms \n",
      "there. It’s nonsense, but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm. We’ll be free \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1569\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">They went \n",
      "through the fortress’s main gate and into the keep. Jeod strode to a side door \n",
      "and pointed to an iron ring. “You can tie the horses there. No one will bother \n",
      "them.” When Snowfire and Cadoc were safely tethered, he opened the door with an \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1570\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Within was a \n",
      "long, empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls. Eragon was surprised by \n",
      "how cold and damp it was. When he touched the wall, his fingers slid over a \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1571\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Jeod snatched a \n",
      "torch from its bracket and led them down the hall. They stopped before a heavy, \n",
      "wooden door. He unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a \n",
      "bearskin rug laden with stuffed chairs. Bookshelves stacked with leather-bound \n",
      "tomes covered the walls.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1572\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Jeod piled wood \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1573\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom’s face \n",
      "crinkled with a smile. “Who are you calling an old man? The last time I saw you \n",
      "there was no gray in your hair. Now it looks like it’s in the final stages of \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1574\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“And you look \n",
      "the same as you did nearly twenty years ago. Time seems to have preserved you \n",
      "as a crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation. Enough \n",
      "of this! Get on with the story. That’s always what you were good at,” said Jeod \n",
      "impatiently. Eragon’s ears pricked up, and he waited eagerly to hear what Brom \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1575\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom relaxed \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1577\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“An \n",
      "understatement, but true nevertheless,” said Brom dryly. “When we were . . . \n",
      "separated, I couldn’t find you. In the midst of the turmoil I stumbled into a \n",
      "small room. There wasn’t anything extraordinary in it—just crates and boxes—but \n",
      "out of curiosity, I rummaged around anyway. Fortune smiled on me that hour, for \n",
      "I found what we had been searching for.” An expression of shock ran over Jeod’s \n",
      "face. “Once it was in my hands, I couldn’t wait for you. At any second I might \n",
      "have been discovered, and all lost. Disguising myself as best I could, I fled \n",
      "the city and ran to the . . .” Brom hesitated and glanced at Eragon, then said, \n",
      "“ran to our friends. They stored it in a vault, for safekeeping, and made me promise \n",
      "to care for whomever received it. Until the day when my skills would be needed, \n",
      "I had to disappear. No one could know that I was alive—not even you—though it \n",
      "grieved me to pain you unnecessarily. So I went north and hid in Carvahall.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1579\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Jeod frowned and \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1581\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">He sighed. “I \n",
      "suppose the ruse was unavoidable, though I wish they had told me. Isn’t Carvahall \n",
      "farther north, on the other side of the Spine?” Brom inclined his head. For the \n",
      "first time, Jeod inspected Eragon. His gray eyes took in every detail. He \n",
      "raised his eyebrows and said, “I assume, then, that you are fulfilling your \n",

      "presume, for I haven’t received word from our friends, and I suspect their \n",
      "messengers were waylaid—so I decided to find out what I could. Eragon happened \n",

      "You can only observe people, places, and things that you’ve already seen. If \n",
      "you were to scry the Ra’zac, you’d see them all right, but not their \n",
      "surroundings. There are other problems as well. Let’s say that you wanted to \n",
      "view a page in a book, one that you’d already seen. You could only see the page \n",

      "his head. She shrugged and drank deeply. “This,” she said, wiping her mouth, \n",
      "“is the hardest reading I’ve ever done. You were right. Your future is nigh \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1786\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Solembum jumped \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1787\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The symbol on \n",
      "the bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it. “Infinity or \n",
      "long life,” said Angela quietly. “This is the first time I have ever seen it \n",
      "come up in someone’s future. Most of the time it’s the aspen or the elm, both \n",
      "signs that a person will live a normal span of years. Whether this means that \n",
      "you will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life, \n",

      "of them. “Here the wandering path, lightning bolt, and sailing ship all lie \n",
      "together—a pattern I’ve never seen, only heard of. The wandering path shows \n",
      "that there are many choices in your future, some of which you face even now. I \n",

      "the mighty powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny. \n",
      "Countless possible futures await you—all of them filled with blood and \n",
      "conflict—but only one will bring you happiness and peace. Beware of losing your \n",
      "way, for you are one of the few who are truly free to choose their own fate. \n",
      "That freedom is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1790\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Then her face \n",
      "grew sad. “And yet, as if to counteract that, here is the lightning bolt. It is \n",
      "a terrible omen. There is a doom upon you, but of what sort I know not. Part of \n",
      "it lies in a death—one that rapidly approaches and will cause you much grief. \n",
      "But the rest awaits in a great journey. Look closely at this bone. You can see \n",
      "how its end rests on that of the sailing ship. That is impossible to \n",
      "misunderstand. Your fate will be to leave this land forever. Where you will end \n",
      "up I know not, but you will never again stand in Alagaësia. This is \n",

      "they’re not in Teirm, and I doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the \n",

      "someone were to die from Seithr oil in Galbatorix’s court, it would be all too \n",
      "easy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the Empire had been buying \n",
      "large amounts of it. That still leaves many others, any one of which could be \n",
      "the one we want.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "Kuasta, Dras-Leona, Aroughs, and Belatona. Kuasta wouldn’t work for the Ra’zac; \n",
      "it’s on the coast and surrounded by mountains. Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon, \n",
      "though it is a center of trade. That leaves Belatona and Dras-Leona, which are \n",
      "rather close together. Of the two, I think Dras-Leona is the likelier. It’s \n",
      "larger and better situated.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1929\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“And that’s \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1931\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Jeod looked at \n",
      "the parchment. “Here it is. At the beginning of the year, three shipments of \n",
      "Seithr oil were sent to Dras-Leona. Each shipment was only two weeks apart, and \n",
      "the records say they were all transported by the same merchant. The same thing \n",
      "happened last year and the year before that. I doubt any one jeweler, or even a \n",
      "group of them, has the money for so much oil.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1932\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“What about \n",

      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1933\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“It doesn’t have \n",
      "the same access to the rest of the Empire. And,” Jeod tapped the parchment, \n",
      "“they’ve only received the oil twice in recent years.” He thought for a moment, \n",
      "then said, “Besides, I think we forgot something—Helgrind.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1934\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Brom nodded. “Ah \n",
      "yes, the Dark Gates. It’s been many years since I’ve thought of it. You’re \n",
      "right, that would make Dras-Leona perfect for the Ra’zac. I guess it’s decided, \n",
      "then; that’s where we’ll go.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1935\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Eragon sat \n",
      "abruptly, too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind was.<i>I thought I \n",
      "would be happy to resume the hunt. Instead, I feel like an abyss has opened up \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_1936\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The parchment \n",
      "crackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map. He handed it to Brom and said, \n",
      "“You’ll need this, I’m afraid. Your expeditions often take you into obscure \n",
      "regions.” Nodding, Brom accepted the map. Jeod clapped him on the shoulder. “It \n",
      "doesn’t feel right that you will leave without me. My heart expects to go \n",
      "along, but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "his pipe, and they left for their rooms, exhausted. Before he fell asleep, \n",

      "dark blur rushed from a cloud, then heard a dull roar as Saphira’s wings flared \n",
      "open. The sun shone behind the thin membranes, turning them translucent and \n",

      "wind at her tail, Saphira sliced through the air.<i>Hold on,</i> she warned \n",
      "Eragon, and letting out a wild bugle, she soared in a great loop. Eragon yelled \n",

      "were sore from riding bareback, and his hands and face were numb from the cold \n",
      "air. Saphira’s scales were always warm to the touch, but she could not keep him \n",
      "from getting chilled. When they landed for lunch, he buried his hands in his \n",
      "clothes and found a warm, sunny place to sit. As he and Brom ate, Eragon asked \n",

      "the city wall. When the gates finally came into view, Eragon pulled on Cadoc’s \n",

      "series of blows, Murtagh started laughing. Not only was it impossible for \n",
      "either of them to gain an advantage, but they were so evenly matched that they \n",
      "tired at the same rate. Acknowledging with grins each other’s skill, they \n",
      "fought on until their arms were leaden and sweat poured off their sides.<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_2535\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">Finally Eragon \n",
      "called, “Enough, halt!” Murtagh stopped in mid-blow and sat down with a gasp. \n",
      "Eragon staggered to the ground, his chest heaving. None of his fights with Brom \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_2536\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As he gulped air, \n",
      "Murtagh exclaimed, “You’re amazing! I’ve studied swordplay all my life, but \n",
      "never have I fought one like you. You could be the king’s weapon master if you \n",
      "wanted to.”<p/></span></p> \n",
      " \n",
      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_2537\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">“You’re just as \n",
      "good,” observed Eragon, still panting. “The man who taught you, Tornac, could \n",
      "make a fortune with a fencing school. People would come from all parts of \n",
      "Alagaësia to learn from him.”<p/></span></p> \n",

      "their custom to fight in the evening, which kept them lean and fit, like a pair \n",
      "of matched blades. With his return to health, Eragon also resumed practicing \n",
      "magic. Murtagh was curious about it and soon revealed that he knew a surprising \n",
      "amount about how it worked, though he lacked the precise details and could not \n",
      "use it himself. Whenever Eragon practiced speaking in the ancient language, \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_2756\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">As the leather \n",

      "covered with scabs that made her skin look like dry, cracked mud. She had been \n",
      "whipped mercilessly and branded with hot irons in the shape of claws. Where her \n",
      "skin was still intact, it was purple and black from numerous beatings. On her \n",
      "left shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink. It was the same symbol \n",

      "gently laid a hand on the elf’s spine, Saphira settled next to him, her \n",

      "unmarked skin flowed over it, joining together without a scar. He passed over \n",
      "bruises or other wounds that were not life-threatening—healing them all would \n",
      "consume the energy he needed for more serious injuries. As Eragon toiled, he \n",
      "marveled that the elf was still alive. She had been repeatedly tortured to the \n",

      "exhausted and did not dwell upon it—though his ears turned red at times, and he \n",

      "replenish himself from his fast, the escape, and now healing the elf. Saphira \n",
      "remained by his side, lending her strength where she could. The sun was well \n",
      "into the sky when he finally stood, groaning as his cramped muscles stretched. \n",
      "His hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty. He stumbled to the \n",

      "able to revive her, but . . .” He gestured helplessly. His hand was shaking so \n",
      "badly he spilled some of the wine. Another swig helped to steady him. “We’d \n",

      "Saphira jumped skyward, her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws \n",
      "gouged the rocks underneath. Her wings strained furiously, struggling to lift \n",
      "the enormous load. For a moment it seemed she would fall back to the ground. \n",
      "Then, with a lunge, she shot into the air. Tornac screamed in terror, kicking \n",
      "and tossing. It was a terrible sound, like screeching metal.<p/></span></p> \n",

      "hysterics. He had to tie Tornac down to prevent him from running away.</i> She \n",
      "gripped Snowfire and carried him off, ignoring the horse’s trumpeted \n",

      "a massive volcanic crater. Its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high \n",
      "above that Eragon could not judge the distance—it might have been more than a \n",

      "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" id=\"calibre_css_id_3473\"><span class=\"calibre_class_4\">The crowd \n",

      "polished and shaped into flowing contours, as if it had been poured into place. \n",
      "It was dotted with countless round windows framed by elaborate carvings. A \n",

      "reached Tronjheim’s base, Saphira paused to see if the bald man had any \n",
      "instructions. When none were forthcoming, she continued to the gate. The walls \n",
      "were lined with fluted pillars of blood-red jasper. Between the pillars hulked \n",

      "The top three levels were pierced by rows of archways that revealed gray tunnels \n",
      "curving off into the distance. Clumps of people filled the arches, eagerly \n",
      "watching Eragon and Saphira. On ground level, however, the archways were barred \n",

      "yards across and nearly as thick. Its face had been carved to resemble a rose \n",
      "in full bloom, and so skilled was the craftsmanship, the flower almost seemed \n",
      "to be real. A wide belt of lanterns wrapped around the edge of the sapphire, \n",
      "which cast striated bands of blushing light over everything below. The flashing \n",

      "dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim. We call it Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. \n",
      "Running up or down it isn’t swift enough for an emergency, nor convenient \n",

      "place—it’s far too musty for my taste. And everyone in Farthen Dûr is<i>so</i> \n",
      "serious and noble. They’re probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway.” She \n",
      "gave a long sigh, a mocking expression on her face. “And the dwarves are just a \n",

      "matter of this Shade, Durza. I think he’s the greatest threat to the Varden \n",
      "right now, aside from Galbatorix. I<i>loathe</i> Shades—they practice the most \n",

      "spirits and the spirits’ powers. Shades, however, relinquish that control in \n",
      "their search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlled<i>by</i> \n",
      "spirits. Unfortunately, only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans, and \n",
      "once ensconced they never leave. Such possession can happen by accident if a \n",
      "sorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself. The problem is, once a Shade \n",
      "is created, it’s terribly difficult to kill. As I’m sure you know, only two \n",

      "excuse me, frogs, but when that didn’t deter them, I sneaked up here in the \n",

      "there’s plenty of maneuvering room for our armies. Since the Urgals have access \n",

A tall Shade \\nlifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson \\nhair and maroon eyes.\\nHe blinked in \\nsurprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He \\nweighed the odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. \\nStop whoever is coming . . . or die.”\\nAround him \\nshuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with \\nblack symbols. They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made \\nfor crushing. A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears. The monsters \\nhurried into the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling quieted and the \\nforest was silent again.\\nThe Shade peered \\naround a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any human to \\nsee, but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the \\ntrees; every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze. He remained \\nunnaturally quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin scratch curved \\ndown the blade. The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet \\nstout enough to hack through the hardest armor.\\nThe Urgals could \\nnot see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling with \\ntheir weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed \\nuntil the bird flew past. Then the monsters shivered in the cold night; one \\nsnapped a twig with his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger, and the Urgals \\nshrank back, motionless. He suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid \\nmeat—and turned away. They were tools, nothing more.\\nThe Shade forced \\nback his impatience as the minutes became hours. The scent must have wafted far \\nahead of its owners. He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves. He \\ndenied himself those luxuries, too, and stayed behind the tree, watching the \\ntrail. Another gust of wind rushed through the forest. The smell was stronger \\nthis time. Excited, he lifted a thin lip in a snarl.\\n“Get ready,” he \\nwhispered, his whole body vibrating. The tip of his sword moved in small \\ncircles. It had taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment. \\nIt would not do to lose control now.\\nEyes brightened \\nunder the Urgals’ thick brows, and the creatures gripped their weapons tighter. \\nAhead of them, the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone. \\nFaint smudges emerged from the darkness and advanced down the trail.\\nThree white \\nhorses with riders cantered toward the ambush, their heads held high and proud, \\ntheir coats rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver.\\nOn the first \\nhorse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His build \\nwas slim but strong, like a rapier. A powerful bow was slung on his back. A \\nsword pressed against his side opposite a quiver of arrows fletched with swan \\nfeathers.\\nThe last rider \\nhad the same fair face and angled features as the other. He carried a long \\nspear in his right hand and a white dagger at his belt. A helm of extraordinary \\ncraftsmanship, wrought with amber and gold, rested on his head.\\nBetween these \\ntwo rode a raven-haired elven lady, who surveyed her surroundings with poise. \\nFramed by long black locks, her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her \\nclothes were unadorned, yet her beauty was undiminished. At her side was a \\nsword, and on her back a long bow with a quiver. She carried in her lap a pouch \\nthat she frequently looked at, as if to reassure herself that it was still \\nthere.\\nOne of the elves \\nspoke quietly, but the Shade could not hear what was said. The lady answered \\nwith obvious authority, and her guards switched places. The one wearing the \\nhelm took the lead, shifting his spear to a readier grip. They passed the \\nShade’s hiding place and the first few Urgals without suspicion.\\nThe Shade was \\nalready savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward \\nthe elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and \\ntossed their heads. The riders stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then \\nwheeled their mounts around and galloped away.\\nThe lady’s horse \\nsurged forward, leaving her guards far behind. Forsaking their hiding, the \\nUrgals stood and released a stream of black arrows. The Shade jumped out from \\nbehind the tree, raised his right hand, and shouted, “Garjzla!”\\nA red bolt \\nflashed from his palm toward the elven lady, illuminating the trees with a \\nbloody light. It struck her steed, and the horse toppled with a high-pitched \\nsqueal, plowing into the ground chest-first. She leapt off the animal with \\ninhuman speed, landed lightly, then glanced back for her guards.\\nThe Urgals’ \\ndeadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves. They fell from the noble \\nhorses, blood pooling in the dirt. As the Urgals rushed to the slain elves, the \\nShade screamed, “After her! She is the one I want!” The monsters grunted and \\nrushed down the trail.\\nA cry tore from \\nthe elf’s lips as she saw her dead companions. She took a step toward them, \\nthen cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest.\\nWhile the Urgals \\ncrashed through the trees, the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted \\nabove them. From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest. He \\nraised his hand and uttered, “Böetq istalri!” and a quarter-mile section of the \\nforest exploded into flames. Grimly he burned one section after another until \\nthere was a ring of fire, a half-league across, around the ambush site. The \\nflames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest. Satisfied, he watched \\nthe ring carefully, in case it should falter.\\nThe band of fire \\nthickened, contracting the area the Urgals had to search. Suddenly, the Shade \\nheard shouts and a coarse scream. Through the trees he saw three of his charges \\nfall in a pile, mortally wounded. He caught a glimpse of the elf running from \\nthe remaining Urgals.\\nShe fled toward \\nthe craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed. The Shade examined the \\nground twenty feet below, then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her. She \\nskidded around and sped back to the trail. Black Urgal blood dripped from her \\nsword, staining the pouch in her hand.\\nThe horned \\nmonsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in, blocking the only escape \\nroutes. Her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out. Seeing none, \\nshe drew herself up with regal disdain. The Shade approached her with a raised \\nhand, allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness.\\n“Get her.”\\nAs the Urgals \\nsurged forward, the elf pulled open the pouch, reached into it, and then let it \\ndrop to the ground. In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the \\nangry light of the fires. She raised it over her head, lips forming frantic \\nwords. Desperate, the Shade barked, “Garjzla!”\\nA ball of red \\nflame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf, fast as an arrow. But he \\nwas too late. A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest, and the \\nstone vanished. Then the red fire smote her and she collapsed.\\nThe Shade howled \\nin rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway \\nthrough the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from \\nhis palm—which killed the Urgals instantly—then ripped his sword free and \\nstrode to the elf.\\nProphecies of \\nrevenge, spoken in a wretched language only he knew, rolled from his tongue. He \\nclenched his thin hands and glared at the sky. The cold stars stared back, \\nunwinking, otherworldly watchers. Disgust curled his lip before he turned back \\nto the unconscious elf.\\nHer beauty, \\nwhich would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed \\nthat the stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among \\nthe trees. After tying the elf onto the saddle, he mounted the charger and made \\nhis way out of the woods.\\nHe quenched the \\nfires in his path but left the rest to burn.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nDISCOVERY \\nEragon knelt in a \\nbed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The \\nprints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. \\nSoon they would bed down. His target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her \\nleft forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she had made it so far \\nwithout a wolf or bear catching her.\\nThe sky was \\nclear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted \\nover the mountains that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast \\nfrom the harvest moon cradled between two peaks. Streams flowed down the \\nmountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding mist crept \\nalong the valley’s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.\\nEragon was fifteen, \\nless than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown \\neyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was \\nsheathed at his belt, and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. \\nHe carried a wood-frame pack.\\nThe deer had led \\nhim deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down \\nthe land of Alagaësia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, \\nusually boding ill. Despite that, Eragon did not fear the Spine—he was the only \\nhunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses.\\nIt was the third \\nnight of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he \\nwould be forced to return home empty-handed. His family needed the meat for the \\nrapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.\\nEragon stood \\nwith quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward \\na glen where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from \\nview and cast feathery shadows on the ground. He looked at the tracks only \\noccasionally; he knew the way.\\nAt the glen, he \\nstrung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, \\nholding the others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so \\nmotionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass. The doe he wanted was at the \\nedge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.\\nEragon slowly \\ncrept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had \\nled to this moment. He took a last steadying breath and—an explosion shattered \\nthe night.\\nThe herd bolted. \\nEragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his \\ncheek. He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by \\na finger’s breadth and hissed into darkness. He cursed and spun around, \\ninstinctively nocking another arrow.\\nBehind him, \\nwhere the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of \\nthe pines stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was \\nflattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell. In the \\ncenter of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across the \\nscorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.\\nEragon watched \\nfor danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the \\nmist. Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. \\nMoonlight cast him in pale shadow as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it \\nwith an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so he warily picked it up.\\nNature had never \\npolished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, \\nexcept for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool \\nand frictionless under his fingers, like hardened silk. Oval and about a foot \\nlong, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should have.\\nEragon found the \\nstone both beautiful and frightening.Where did it come from? Does it have a \\npurpose? Then a more disturbing thought came to him:Was it sent here by \\naccident, or am I meant to have it? If he had learned anything from the old \\nstories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.\\nBut what should \\nI do with the stone?It \\nwould be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was dangerous. It might \\nbe better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he \\nalmost dropped it, but something stayed his hand.At the very least, it might \\npay for some food, he decided with a shrug, tucking the stone into his \\npack.\\nThe glen was too \\nexposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his \\nbedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of \\nbread and cheese, he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering \\nwhat had occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nP ALANCARVALLEY\\nThe sun rose the \\nnext morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow. The air was \\nfresh, sweet, and very cold. Ice edged the streams, and small pools were \\ncompletely frozen over. After a breakfast of porridge, Eragon returned to the \\nglen and examined the charred area. The morning light revealed no new details, \\nso he started for home.\\nThe rough game \\ntrail was faintly worn and, in places, nonexistent. Because it had been forged \\nby animals, it often backtracked and took long detours. Yet for all its flaws, \\nit was still the fastest way out of the mountains.\\nThe Spine was \\none of the only places that King Galbatorix could not call his own. Stories \\nwere still told about how half his army disappeared after marching into its \\nancient forest. A cloud of misfortune and bad luck seemed to hang over it. \\nThough the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly, few people could stay in \\nthe Spine for long without suffering an accident. Eragon was one of those \\nfew—not through any particular gift, it seemed to him, but because of \\npersistent vigilance and sharp reflexes. He had hiked in the mountains for \\nyears, yet he was still wary of them. Every time he thought they had surrendered \\ntheir secrets, something happened to upset his understanding of them—like the \\nstone’s appearance.\\nHe kept up a \\nbrisk pace, and the leagues steadily disappeared. In late evening he arrived at \\nthe edge of a precipitous ravine. The Anora River rushed by far below, heading \\nto Palancar Valley. Gorged with hundreds of tiny streams, the river was a brute \\nforce, battling against the rocks and boulders that barred its way. A low \\nrumble filled the air.\\nHe camped in a \\nthicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed.\\n\\xa0\\nIt grew colder \\nover the next day and a half. Eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the \\nwary wildlife. A bit past noon, he heard the Igualda Falls blanketing \\neverything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes. The trail led him onto a \\nmoist slate outcropping, which the river sped past, flinging itself into empty \\nair and down mossy cliffs.\\nBefore him lay \\nPalancar Valley, exposed like an unrolled map. The base of the Igualda Falls, \\nmore than a half-mile below, was the northernmost point of the valley. A little \\nways from the falls was Carvahall, a cluster of brown buildings. White smoke \\nrose from the chimneys, defiant of the wilderness around it. At this height, \\nfarms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger. The land \\naround them was tan or sandy, where dead grass swayed in the wind. The Anora \\nRiver wound from the falls toward Palancar’s southern end, reflecting great \\nstrips of sunlight. Far in the distance it flowed past the village Therinsford \\nand the lonely mountain Utgard. Beyond that, he knew only that it turned north \\nand ran to the sea.\\nAfter a pause, \\nEragon left the outcropping and started down the trail, grimacing at the \\ndescent. When he arrived at the bottom, soft dusk was creeping over everything, \\nblurring colors and shapes into gray masses. Carvahall’s lights shimmered \\nnearby in the twilight; the houses cast long shadows. Aside from Therinsford, \\nCarvahall was the only village in Palancar Valley. The settlement was secluded \\nand surrounded by harsh, beautiful land. Few traveled here except merchants and \\ntrappers.\\nThe village was \\ncomposed of stout log buildings with low roofs—some thatched, others shingled. \\nSmoke billowed from the chimneys, giving the air a woody smell. The buildings \\nhad wide porches where people gathered to talk and conduct business. \\nOccasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit. Eragon heard men \\ntalking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands, \\nscolding them for being late.\\nEragon wove his \\nway between the houses to the butcher’s shop, a broad, thick-beamed building. \\nOverhead, the chimney belched black smoke.\\nHe pushed the \\ndoor open. The spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a \\nstone fireplace. A bare counter stretched across the far side of the room. The \\nfloor was strewn with loose straw. Everything was scrupulously clean, as if the \\nowner spent his leisure time digging in obscure crannies for minuscule pieces \\nof filth. Behind the counter stood the butcher Sloan. A small man, he wore a \\ncotton shirt and a long, bloodstained smock. An impressive array of knives \\nswung from his belt. He had a sallow, pockmarked face, and his black eyes were \\nsuspicious. He polished the counter with a ragged cloth.\\nSloan’s mouth \\ntwisted as Eragon entered. “Well, the mighty hunter joins the rest of us \\nmortals. How many did you bag this time?”\\n“None,” was \\nEragon’s curt reply. He had never liked Sloan. The butcher always treated him \\nwith disdain, as if he were something unclean. A widower, Sloan seemed to care \\nfor only one person—his daughter, Katrina, on whom he doted.\\n“I’m amazed,” \\nsaid Sloan with affected astonishment. He turned his back on Eragon to scrape \\nsomething off the wall. “And that’s your reason for coming here?”\\n“Yes,” admitted \\nEragon uncomfortably.\\n“If that’s the \\ncase, let’s see your money.” Sloan tapped his fingers when Eragon shifted his \\nfeet and remained silent. “Come on—either you have it or you don’t. Which is \\nit?”\\n“I don’t really \\nhave any money, but I do—”\\n“What, no \\nmoney?” the butcher cut him off sharply. “And you expect to buy meat! Are the \\nother merchants giving away their wares? Should I just hand you the goods \\nwithout charge? Besides,” he said abruptly, “it’s late. Come back tomorrow with \\nmoney. I’m closed for the day.”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim. “I can’t wait until tomorrow, Sloan. It’ll be worth your while, though; I \\nfound something to pay you with.” He pulled out the stone with a flourish and \\nset it gently on the scarred counter, where it gleamed with light from the \\ndancing flames.\\n“Stole it is \\nmore likely,” muttered Sloan, leaning forward with an interested expression.\\nIgnoring the \\ncomment, Eragon asked, “Will this be enough?”\\nSloan picked up \\nthe stone and gauged its weight speculatively. He ran his hands over its \\nsmoothness and inspected the white veins. With a calculating look, he set it \\ndown. “It’s pretty, but how much is it worth?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nadmitted Eragon, “but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it \\nunless it had some value.”\\n“Obviously,” said \\nSloan with exaggerated patience. “But how much value? Since you don’t know, I \\nsuggest that you find a trader who does, or take my offer of three crowns.”\\n“That’s a \\nmiser’s bargain! It must be worth at least ten times that,” protested Eragon. \\nThree crowns would not even buy enough meat to last a week.\\nSloan shrugged. \\n“If you don’t like my offer, wait until the traders arrive. Either way, I’m \\ntired of this conversation.”\\nThe traders were \\na nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited Carvahall every \\nspring and winter. They bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers \\nhad managed to grow or make, and sold what they needed to live through another \\nyear: seeds, animals, fabric, and supplies like salt and sugar.\\nBut Eragon did \\nnot want to wait until they arrived; it could be a while, and his family needed \\nthe meat now. “Fine, I accept,” he snapped.\\n“Good, I’ll get \\nyou the meat. Not that it matters, but where did you find this?”\\n“Two nights ago \\nin the Spine—”\\n“Get out!” \\ndemanded Sloan, pushing the stone away. He stomped furiously to the end of the \\ncounter and started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife.\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon. He drew the stone closer, as if to protect it from Sloan’s wrath.\\n“I won’t deal \\nwith anything you bring back from those damned mountains! Take your sorcerer’s \\nstone elsewhere.” Sloan’s hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the \\nknife, but he seemed not to notice. He continued to scrub, staining the blade \\nwith fresh blood.\\n“You refuse to \\nsell to me!”\\n“Yes! Unless you \\npay with coins,” Sloan growled, and hefted the knife, sidling away. “Go, before \\nI make you!”\\nThe door behind \\nthem slammed open. Eragon whirled around, ready for more trouble. In stomped \\nHorst, a hulking man. Sloan’s daughter, Katrina—a tall girl of sixteen—trailed \\nbehind him with a determined expression. Eragon was surprised to see her; she \\nusually absented herself from any arguments involving her father. Sloan glanced \\nat them warily, then started to accuse Eragon. “He won’t—”\\n“Quiet,” \\nannounced Horst in a rumbling voice, cracking his knuckles at the same time. He \\nwas Carvahall’s smith, as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested. \\nHis powerful arms were bare to the elbow; a great expanse of hairy muscular \\nchest was visible through the top of his shirt. A black beard, carelessly \\ntrimmed, roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles. “Sloan, what have you done \\nnow?”\\n“Nothing.” He \\ngave Eragon a murderous gaze, then spat, “This . . .boy came in here and \\nstarted badgering me. I asked him to leave, but he won’t budge. I even \\nthreatened him and he still ignored me!” Sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at \\nHorst.\\n“Is this true?” \\ndemanded the smith.\\n“No!” replied \\nEragon. “I offered this stone as payment for some meat, and he accepted it. \\nWhen I told him that I’d found it in the Spine, he refused to even touch it. \\nWhat difference does it make where it came from?”\\nHorst looked at \\nthe stone curiously, then returned his attention to the butcher. “Why won’t you \\ntrade with him, Sloan? I’ve no love for the Spine myself, but if it’s a \\nquestion of the stone’s worth, I’ll back it with my own money.”\\nThe question \\nhung in the air for a moment. Then Sloan licked his lips and said, “This is my \\nown store. I can do whatever I want.”\\nKatrina stepped \\nout from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten \\ncopper. “Father, Eragonis willing to pay. Give him the meat, and then we \\ncan have supper.”\\nSloan’s eyes \\nnarrowed dangerously. “Go back to the house; this is none of your business. . . \\n. I saidgo !” Katrina’s face hardened, then she marched out of the room \\nwith a stiff back.\\nEragon watched \\nwith disapproval but dared not interfere. Horst tugged at his beard before \\nsaying reproachfully, “Fine, you can deal with me. What were you going to get, \\nEragon?” His voice reverberated through the room.\\n“As much as I \\ncould.”\\nHorst pulled out \\na purse and counted out a pile of coins. “Give me your best roasts and steaks. \\nMake sure that it’s enough to fill Eragon’s pack.” The butcher hesitated, his \\ngaze darting between Horst and Eragon. “Not selling to me would be a very bad \\nidea,” stated Horst.\\nGlowering \\nvenomously, Sloan slipped into the back room. A frenzy of chopping, wrapping, \\nand low cursing reached them. After several uncomfortable minutes, he returned \\nwith an armful of wrapped meat. His face was expressionless as he accepted \\nHorst’s money, then proceeded to clean his knife, pretending that they were not \\nthere.\\nHorst scooped up \\nthe meat and walked outside. Eragon hurried behind him, carrying his pack and \\nthe stone. The crisp night air rolled over their faces, refreshing after the \\nstuffy shop.\\n“Thank you, \\nHorst. Uncle Garrow will be pleased.”\\nHorst laughed \\nquietly. “Don’t thank me. I’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Sloan’s a \\nvicious troublemaker; it does him good to be humbled. Katrina heard what was \\nhappening and ran to fetch me. Good thing I came—the two of you were almost at \\nblows. Unfortunately, I doubt he’ll serve you or any of your family the next \\ntime you go in there, even if you do have coins.”\\n“Why did he \\nexplode like that? We’ve never been friendly, but he’s always taken our money. \\nAnd I’ve never seen him treat Katrina that way,” said Eragon, opening the top \\nof the pack.\\nHorst shrugged. \\n“Ask your uncle. He knows more about it than I do.”\\nEragon stuffed \\nthe meat into his pack. “Well, now I have one more reason to hurry home . . . \\nto solve this mystery. Here, this is rightfully yours.” He proffered the stone.\\nHorst chuckled. \\n“No, you keep your strange rock. As for payment, Albriech plans to leave for \\nFeinster next spring. He wants to become a master smith, and I’m going to need \\nan assistant. You can come and work off the debt on your spare days.”\\nEragon bowed \\nslightly, delighted. Horst had two sons, Albriech and Baldor, both of whom \\nworked in his forge. Taking one’s place was a generous offer. “Again, thank \\nyou! I look forward to working with you.” He was glad that there was a way for \\nhim to pay Horst. His uncle would never accept charity. Then Eragon remembered \\nwhat his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt. “Roran wanted me \\nto give Katrina a message, but since I can’t, can you get it to her?”\\n“Of course.”\\n“He wants her to \\nknow that he’ll come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will \\nsee her then.”\\n“That all?”\\nEragon was \\nslightly embarrassed. “No, he also wants her to know that she is the most \\nbeautiful girl he has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else.”\\nHorst’s face \\nbroke into a broad grin, and he winked at Eragon. “Getting serious, isn’t he?”\\n“Yes, sir,” \\nEragon answered with a quick smile. “Could you also give her my thanks? It was \\nnice of her to stand up to her father for me. I hope that she isn’t punished \\nbecause of it. Roran would be furious if I got her into trouble.”\\n“I wouldn’t \\nworry about it. Sloan doesn’t know that she called me, so I doubt he’ll be too \\nhard on her. Before you go, will you sup with us?”\\n“I’m sorry, but \\nI can’t. Garrow is expecting me,” said Eragon, tying off the top of the pack. \\nHe hoisted it onto his back and started down the road, raising his hand in \\nfarewell.\\nThe meat slowed \\nhim down, but he was eager to be home, and renewed vigor filled his steps. The \\nvillage ended abruptly, and he left its warm lights behind. The pearlescent \\nmoon peeked over the mountains, bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of \\ndaylight. Everything looked bleached and flat.\\nNear the end of \\nhis journey, he turned off the road, which continued south. A simple path led \\nstraight through waist-high grass and up a knoll, almost hidden by the shadows \\nof protective elm trees. He crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining \\nfrom his home.\\nThe house had a \\nshingled roof and a brick chimney. Eaves hung over the whitewashed walls, \\nshadowing the ground below. One side of the enclosed porch was filled with \\nsplit wood, ready for the fire. A jumble of farm tools cluttered the other \\nside.\\nThe house had \\nbeen abandoned for half a century when they moved in after Garrow’s wife, \\nMarian, died. It was ten miles from Carvahall, farther than anyone else’s. \\nPeople considered the distance dangerous because the family could not rely on \\nhelp from the village in times of trouble, but Eragon’s uncle would not listen.\\nA hundred feet \\nfrom the house, in a dull-colored barn, lived two horses—Birka and Brugh—with \\nchickens and a cow. Sometimes there was also a pig, but they had been unable to \\nafford one this year. A wagon sat wedged between the stalls. On the edge of \\ntheir fields, a thick line of trees traced along the Anora River.\\nHe saw a light \\nmove behind a window as he wearily reached the porch. “Uncle, it’s Eragon. Let \\nme in.” A small shutter slid back for a second, then the door swung inward.\\nGarrow stood \\nwith his hand on the door. His worn clothes hung on him like rags on a stick \\nframe. A lean, hungry face with intense eyes gazed out from under graying hair. \\nHe looked like a man who had been partly mummified before it was discovered \\nthat he was still alive. “Roran’s sleeping,” was his answer to Eragon’s \\ninquiring glance.\\nA lantern \\nflickered on a wood table so old that the grain stood up in tiny ridges like a \\ngiant fingerprint. Near a woodstove were rows of cooking utensils tacked onto \\nthe wall with homemade nails. A second door opened to the rest of the house. \\nThe floor was made of boards polished smooth by years of tramping feet.\\nEragon pulled \\noff his pack and took out the meat. “What’s this? Did you buy meat? Where did \\nyou get the money?” asked his uncle harshly as he saw the wrapped packages.\\nEragon took a \\nbreath before answering. “No, Horst bought it for us.”\\n“You let him pay \\nfor it? I told you before, I won’t beg for our food. If we can’t feed \\nourselves, we might as well move into town. Before you can turn around twice, \\nthey’ll be sending us used clothes and asking if we’ll be able to get through \\nthe winter.” Garrow’s face paled with anger.\\n“I didn’t accept \\ncharity,” snapped Eragon. “Horst agreed to let me work off the debt this \\nspring. He needs someone to help him because Albriech is going away.”\\n“And where will \\nyou get the time to work for him? Are you going to ignore all the things that \\nneed to be done here?” asked Garrow, forcing his voice down.\\nEragon hung his \\nbow and quiver on hooks beside the front door. “I don’t know how I’ll do it,” \\nhe said irritably. “Besides, I found something that could be worth some money.” \\nHe set the stone on the table.\\nGarrow bowed \\nover it: the hungry look on his face became ravenous, and his fingers moved \\nwith a strange twitch. “You found this in the Spine?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon. He explained what had happened. “And to make matters worse, I lost my \\nbest arrow. I’ll have to make more before long.” They stared at the stone in \\nthe near darkness.\\n“How was the \\nweather?” asked his uncle, lifting the stone. His hands tightened around it \\nlike he was afraid it would suddenly disappear.\\n“Cold,” was \\nEragon’s reply. “It didn’t snow, but it froze each night.”\\nGarrow looked \\nworried by the news. “Tomorrow you’ll have to help Roran finish harvesting the \\nbarley. If we can get the squash picked, too, the frost won’t bother us.” He \\npassed the stone to Eragon. “Here, keep it. When the traders come, we’ll find \\nout what it’s worth. Selling it is probably the best thing to do. The less \\nwe’re involved with magic, the better. . . . Why did Horst pay for the meat?”\\nIt took only a \\nmoment for Eragon to explain his argument with Sloan. “I just don’t understand \\nwhat angered him so.”\\nGarrow shrugged. \\n“Sloan’s wife, Ismira, went over the Igualda Falls a year before you were \\nbrought here. He hasn’t been near the Spine since, nor had anything to do with \\nit. But that’s no reason to refuse payment. I think he wanted to give you \\ntrouble.”\\nEragon swayed \\nblearily and said, “It’s good to be back.” Garrow’s eyes softened, and he \\nnodded. Eragon stumbled to his room, pushed the stone under his bed, then fell \\nonto the mattress.Home . For the first time since before the hunt, he \\nrelaxed completely as sleep overtook him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD RAGONTALES\\nAt dawn the sun’s \\nrays streamed through the window, warming Eragon’s face. Rubbing his eyes, he \\nsat up on the edge of the bed. The pine floor was cold under his feet. He \\nstretched his sore legs and rubbed his back, yawning.\\nBeside the bed \\nwas a row of shelves covered with objects he had collected. There were twisted \\npieces of wood, odd bits of shells, rocks that had broken to reveal shiny \\ninteriors, and strips of dry grass tied into knots. His favorite item was a \\nroot so convoluted he never tired of looking at it. The rest of the room was \\nbare, except for a small dresser and nightstand.\\nHe pulled on his \\nboots and stared at the floor, thinking. This was a special day. It was near \\nthis very hour, sixteen years ago, that his mother, Selena, had come home to \\nCarvahall alone and pregnant. She had been gone for six years, living in the \\ncities. When she returned, she wore expensive clothes, and her hair was bound \\nby a net of pearls. She had sought out her brother, Garrow, and asked to stay \\nwith him until the baby arrived. Within five months her son was born. Everyone \\nwas shocked when Selena tearfully begged Garrow and Marian to raise him. When \\nthey asked why, she only wept and said, “I must.” Her pleas had grown \\nincreasingly desperate until they finally agreed. She named him Eragon, then \\ndeparted early the next morning and never returned.\\nEragon still \\nremembered how he had felt when Marian told him the story before she died. The \\nrealization that Garrow and Marian were not his real parents had disturbed him \\ngreatly. Things that had been permanent and unquestionable were suddenly thrown \\ninto doubt. Eventually he had learned to live with it, but he always had a nagging \\nsuspicion that he had not been good enough for his mother.I’m sure there was \\na good reason for what she did; I only wish I knew what it was.\\nOne other thing \\nbothered him: Who was his father? Selena had told no one, and whoever it might \\nbe had never come looking for Eragon. He wished that he knew who it was, if \\nonly to have a name. It would be nice to know his heritage.\\nHe sighed and \\nwent to the nightstand, where he splashed his face, shivering as the water ran \\ndown his neck. Refreshed, he retrieved the stone from under the bed and set it \\non a shelf. The morning light caressed it, throwing a warm shadow on the wall. \\nHe touched it one more time, then hurried to the kitchen, eager to see his \\nfamily. Garrow and Roran were already there, eating chicken. As Eragon greeted \\nthem, Roran stood with a grin.\\nRoran was two \\nyears older than Eragon, muscular, sturdy, and careful with his movements. They \\ncould not have been closer even if they had been real brothers.\\nRoran smiled. \\n“I’m glad you’re back. How was the trip?”\\n“Hard,” replied \\nEragon. “Did Uncle tell you what happened?” He helped himself to a piece of \\nchicken, which he devoured hungrily.\\n“No,” said \\nRoran, and the story was quickly told. At Roran’s insistence, Eragon left his \\nfood to show him the stone. This elicited a satisfactory amount of awe, but \\nRoran soon asked nervously, “Were you able to talk with Katrina?”\\n“No, there \\nwasn’t an opportunity after the argument with Sloan. But she’ll expect you when \\nthe traders come. I gave the message to Horst; he will get it to her.”\\n“You told \\nHorst?” said Roran incredulously. “That was private. If I wanted everyone to \\nknow about it, I could have built a bonfire and used smoke signals to \\ncommunicate. If Sloan finds out, he won’t let me see her again.”\\n“Horst will be \\ndiscreet,” assured Eragon. “He won’t let anyone fall prey to Sloan, least of \\nall you.” Roran seemed unconvinced, but argued no more. They returned to their \\nmeals in the taciturn presence of Garrow. When the last bites were finished, \\nall three went to work in the fields.\\nThe sun was cold \\nand pale, providing little comfort. Under its watchful eye, the last of the \\nbarley was stored in the barn. Next, they gathered prickly vined squash, then \\nthe rutabagas, beets, peas, turnips, and beans, which they packed into the root \\ncellar. After hours of labor, they stretched their cramped muscles, pleased \\nthat the harvest was finished.\\nThe following \\ndays were spent pickling, salting, shelling, and preparing the food for winter.\\nNine days after \\nEragon’s return, a vicious blizzard blew out of the mountains and settled over \\nthe valley. The snow came down in great sheets, blanketing the countryside in \\nwhite. They only dared leave the house for firewood and to feed the animals, \\nfor they feared getting lost in the howling wind and featureless landscape. \\nThey spent their time huddled over the stove as gusts rattled the heavy window \\nshutters. Days later the storm finally passed, revealing an alien world of soft \\nwhite drifts.\\n“I’m afraid the \\ntraders may not come this year, with conditions this bad,” said Garrow. \\n“They’re late as it is. We’ll give them a chance and wait before going to \\nCarvahall. But if they don’t show soon, we’ll have to buy any spare supplies \\nfrom the townspeople.” His countenance was resigned.\\nThey grew \\nanxious as the days crept by without sign of the traders. Talk was sparse, and \\ndepression hung over the house.\\nOn the eighth \\nmorning, Roran walked to the road and confirmed that the traders had not yet \\npassed. The day was spent readying for the trip into Carvahall, scrounging with \\ngrim expressions for saleable items. That evening, out of desperation, Eragon \\nchecked the road again. He found deep ruts cut into the snow, with numerous \\nhoofprints between them. Elated, he ran back to the house whooping, bringing \\nnew life to their preparations.\\n\\xa0\\nThey packed \\ntheir surplus produce into the wagon before sunrise. Garrow put the year’s \\nmoney in a leather pouch that he carefully fastened to his belt. Eragon set the \\nwrapped stone between bags of grain so it would not roll when the wagon hit \\nbumps.\\nAfter a hasty \\nbreakfast, they harnessed the horses and cleared a path to the road. The \\ntraders’ wagons had already broken the drifts, which sped their progress. By \\nnoon they could see Carvahall.\\nIn daylight, it \\nwas a small earthy village filled with shouts and laughter. The traders had \\nmade camp in an empty field on the outskirts of town. Groups of wagons, tents, \\nand fires were randomly spread across it, spots of color against the snow. The \\ntroubadours’ four tents were garishly decorated. A steady stream of people \\nlinked the camp to the village.\\nCrowds churned \\naround a line of bright tents and booths clogging the main street. Horses \\nwhinnied at the noise. The snow had been pounded flat, giving it a glassy \\nsurface; elsewhere, bonfires had melted it. Roasted hazelnuts added a rich \\naroma to the smells wafting around them.\\nGarrow parked \\nthe wagon and picketed the horses, then drew coins from his pouch. “Get \\nyourselves some treats. Roran, do what you want, only be at Horst’s in time for \\nsupper. Eragon, bring that stone and come with me.” Eragon grinned at Roran and \\npocketed the money, already planning how to spend it.\\nRoran departed \\nimmediately with a determined expression on his face. Garrow led Eragon into \\nthe throng, shouldering his way through the bustle. Women were buying cloth, \\nwhile nearby their husbands examined a new latch, hook, or tool. Children ran \\nup and down the road, shrieking with excitement. Knives were displayed here, \\nspices there, and pots were laid out in shiny rows next to leather harnesses.\\nEragon stared at \\nthe traders curiously. They seemed less prosperous than last year. Their \\nchildren had a frightened, wary look, and their clothes were patched. The gaunt \\nmen carried swords and daggers with a new familiarity, and even the women had \\nponiards belted at their waists.\\nWhat could have \\nhappened to make them like this? And why are they so late?wondered Eragon. \\nHe remembered the traders as being full of good cheer, but there was none of \\nthat now. Garrow pushed down the street, searching for Merlock, a trader who \\nspecialized in odd trinkets and pieces of jewelry.\\nThey found him \\nbehind a booth, displaying brooches to a group of women. As each new piece was \\nrevealed, exclamations of admiration followed. Eragon guessed that more than a \\nfew purses would soon be depleted. Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every \\ntime his wares were complimented. He wore a goatee, held himself with ease, and \\nseemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt.\\nThe excited \\ngroup prevented Garrow and Eragon from getting near the trader, so they settled \\non a step and waited. As soon as Merlock was unoccupied, they hurried over.\\n“And what might \\nyou sirs want to look at?” asked Merlock. “An amulet or trinket for a lady?” \\nWith a twirl he pulled out a delicately carved silver rose of excellent \\nworkmanship. The polished metal caught Eragon’s attention, and he eyed it \\nappreciatively. The trader continued, “Not even three crowns, though it has \\ncome all the way from the famed craftsmen of Belatona.”\\nGarrow spoke in \\na quiet voice. “We aren’t looking to buy, but to sell.” Merlock immediately \\ncovered the rose and looked at them with new interest.\\n“I see. Maybe, \\nif this item is of any value, you would like to trade it for one or two of \\nthese exquisite pieces.” He paused for a moment while Eragon and his uncle \\nstood uncomfortably, then continued, “You didbring the object of \\nconsideration?”\\n“We have it, but \\nwe would rather show it to you elsewhere,” said Garrow in a firm voice.\\nMerlock raised \\nan eyebrow, but spoke smoothly. “In that case, let me invite you to my tent.” \\nHe gathered up his wares and gently laid them in an iron-bound chest, which he \\nlocked. Then he ushered them up the street and into the temporary camp. They \\nwound between the wagons to a tent removed from the rest of the traders’. It \\nwas crimson at the top and sable at the bottom, with thin triangles of colors \\nstabbing into each other. Merlock untied the opening and swung the flap to one \\nside.\\nSmall trinkets \\nand strange pieces of furniture, such as a round bed and three seats carved \\nfrom tree stumps, filled the tent. A gnarled dagger with a ruby in the pommel \\nrested on a white cushion.\\nMerlock closed \\nthe flap and turned to them. “Please, seat yourselves.” When they had, he said, \\n“Now show me why we are meeting in private.” Eragon unwrapped the stone and set \\nit between the two men. Merlock reached for it with a gleam in his eye, then \\nstopped and asked, “May I?” When Garrow indicated his approval, Merlock picked \\nit up.\\nHe put the stone \\nin his lap and reached to one side for a thin box. Opened, it revealed a large \\nset of copper scales, which he set on the ground. After weighing the stone, he \\nscrutinized its surface under a jeweler’s glass, tapped it gently with a wooden \\nmallet, and drew the point of a tiny clear stone over it. He measured its \\nlength and diameter, then recorded the figures on a slate. He considered the \\nresults for a while. “Do you know what this is worth?”\\n“No,” admitted \\nGarrow. His cheek twitched, and he shifted uncomfortably on the seat.\\nMerlock \\ngrimaced. “Unfortunately, neither do I. But I can tell you this much: the white \\nveins are the same material as the blue that surrounds them, only a different \\ncolor. What that material might be, though, I haven’t a clue. It’s harder than \\nany rock I have seen, harder even than diamond. Whoever shaped it used tools I \\nhave never seen—or magic. Also, it’s hollow.”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed Garrow.\\nAn irritated \\nedge crept into Merlock’s voice. “Did you ever hear a rock sound like this?” He \\ngrabbed the dagger from the cushion and slapped the stone with the flat of the \\nblade. A pure note filled the air, then faded away smoothly. Eragon was \\nalarmed, afraid that the stone had been damaged. Merlock tilted the stone \\ntoward them. “You will find no scratches or blemishes where the dagger struck. \\nI doubt I could do anything to harm this stone, even if I took a hammer to it.”\\nGarrow crossed \\nhis arms with a reserved expression. A wall of silence surrounded him. Eragon \\nwas puzzled.I knew that the stone appeared in the Spine through magic, but \\nmade by magic? What for and why? He blurted, “But what is it worth?”\\n“I can’t tell \\nyou that,” said Merlock in a pained voice. “I am sure there are people who \\nwould pay dearly to have it, but none of them are in Carvahall. You would have \\nto go to the southern cities to find a buyer. This is a curiosity for most \\npeople—not an item to spend money on when practical things are needed.”\\nGarrow stared at \\nthe tent ceiling like a gambler calculating the odds. “Will you buy it?”\\nThe trader \\nanswered instantly, “It’s not worth the risk. I might be able to find a wealthy \\nbuyer during my spring travels, but I can’t be certain. Even if I did, you \\nwouldn’t be paid until I returned next year. No, you will have to find someone \\nelse to trade with. I am curious, however . . . Why did you insist on talking \\nto me in private?”\\nEragon put the \\nstone away before answering. “Because,” he glanced at the man, wondering if he \\nwould explode like Sloan, “I found this in the Spine, and folks around here \\ndon’t like that.”\\nMerlock gave him \\na startled look. “Do you know why my fellow merchants and I were late this \\nyear?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead.\\n“Our wanderings \\nhave been dogged with misfortune. Chaos seems to rule Alagaësia. We could not \\navoid illness, attacks, and the most cursed black luck. Because the Varden’s \\nattacks have increased, Galbatorix has forced cities to send more soldiers to \\nthe borders, men who are needed to combat the Urgals. The brutes have been \\nmigrating southeast, toward the Hadarac Desert. No one knows why and it \\nwouldn’t concern us, except that they’re passing through populated areas. \\nThey’ve been spotted on roads and near cities. Worst of all are reports of a \\nShade, though the stories are unconfirmed. Not many people survive such an \\nencounter.”\\n“Why haven’t we \\nheard of this?” cried Eragon.\\n“Because,” said \\nMerlock grimly, “it only began a few months ago. Whole villages have been \\nforced to move because Urgals destroyed their fields and starvation threatens.”\\n“Nonsense,” \\ngrowled Garrow. “We haven’t seen any Urgals; the only one around here has his \\nhorns mounted in Morn’s tavern.”\\nMerlock arched \\nan eyebrow. “Maybe so, but this is a small village hidden by mountains. It’s \\nnot surprising that you’ve escaped notice. However, I wouldn’t expect that to \\nlast. I only mentioned this because strange things are happening here as well \\nif you found such a stone in the Spine.” With that sobering statement, he bid \\nthem farewell with a bow and slight smile.\\nGarrow headed \\nback to Carvahall with Eragon trailing behind. “What do you think?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“I’m going to \\nget more information before I make up my mind. Take the stone back to the \\nwagon, then do what you want. I’ll meet you for dinner at Horst’s.”\\nEragon dodged \\nthrough the crowd and happily dashed back to the wagon. Trading would take his \\nuncle hours, time that he planned to enjoy fully. He hid the stone under the \\nbags, then set out into town with a cocky stride.\\nHe walked from \\none booth to another, evaluating the goods with a buyer’s eye, despite his \\nmeager supply of coins. When he talked with the merchants, they confirmed what \\nMerlock had said about the instability in Alagaësia. Over and over the message \\nwas repeated: last year’s security has deserted us; new dangers have appeared, \\nand nothing is safe.\\nLater in the day \\nhe bought three sticks of malt candy and a small piping-hot cherry pie. The hot \\nfood felt good after hours of standing in the snow. He licked the sticky syrup \\nfrom his fingers regretfully, wishing for more, then sat on the edge of a porch \\nand nibbled a piece of candy. Two boys from Carvahall wrestled nearby, but he \\nfelt no inclination to join them.\\nAs the day \\ndescended into late afternoon, the traders took their business into people’s \\nhomes. Eragon was impatient for evening, when the troubadours would come out to \\ntell stories and perform tricks. He loved hearing about magic, gods, and, if \\nthey were especially lucky, the Dragon Riders. Carvahall had its own \\nstoryteller, Brom—a friend of Eragon’s—but his tales grew old over the years, \\nwhereas the troubadours always had new ones that he listened to eagerly.\\nEragon had just \\nbroken off an icicle from the underside of the porch when he spotted Sloan \\nnearby. The butcher had not seen him, so Eragon ducked his head and bolted \\naround a corner toward Morn’s tavern.\\nThe inside was \\nhot and filled with greasy smoke from sputtering tallow candles. The \\nshiny-black Urgal horns, their twisted span as great as his outstretched arms, \\nwere mounted over the door. The bar was long and low, with a stack of staves on \\none end for customers to carve. Morn tended the bar, his sleeves rolled up to \\nhis elbows. The bottom half of his face was short and mashed, as if he had \\nrested his chin on a grinding wheel. People crowded solid oak tables and \\nlistened to two traders who had finished their business early and had come in \\nfor beer.\\nMorn looked up \\nfrom a mug he was cleaning. “Eragon! Good to see you. Where’s your uncle?”\\n“Buying,” said \\nEragon with a shrug. “He’s going to be a while.”\\n“And Roran, is \\nhe here?” asked Morn as he swiped the cloth through another mug.\\n“Yes, no sick \\nanimals to keep him back this year.”\\n“Good, good.”\\nEragon gestured \\nat the two traders. “Who are they?”\\n“Grain buyers. \\nThey bought everyone’s seed at ridiculously low prices, and now they’re telling \\nwild stories, expecting us to believe them.”\\nEragon \\nunderstood why Morn was so upset.People need that money. We can’t get by \\nwithout it. “What kind of stories?”\\nMorn snorted. \\n“They say the Varden have formed a pact with the Urgals and are massing an army \\nto attack us.Supposedly , it’s only through the grace of our king that \\nwe’ve been protected for so long—as if Galbatorix would care if we burned to \\nthe ground. . . . Go listen to them. I have enough on my hands without \\nexplaining their lies.”\\nThe first trader \\nfilled a chair with his enormous girth; his every movement caused it to protest \\nloudly. There was no hint of hair on his face, his pudgy hands were baby \\nsmooth, and he had pouting lips that curled petulantly as he sipped from a flagon. \\nThe second man had a florid face. The skin around his jaw was dry and \\ncorpulent, filled with lumps of hard fat, like cold butter gone rancid. \\nContrasted with his neck and jowls, the rest of his body was unnaturally thin.\\nThe first trader \\nvainly tried to pull back his expanding borders to fit within the chair. He \\nsaid, “No, no, you don’t understand. It is only through the king’s unceasing \\nefforts on your behalf that you are able to argue with us in safety. If he, in \\nall his wisdom, were to withdraw that support, woe unto you!”\\nSomeone \\nhollered, “Right, why don’t you also tell us the Riders have returned and \\nyou’ve each killed a hundred elves. Do you think we’re children to believe in \\nyour tales? We can take care of ourselves.” The group chuckled.\\nThe trader \\nstarted to reply when his thin companion intervened with a wave of his hand. \\nGaudy jewels flashed on his fingers. “You misunderstand. We know the Empire \\ncannot care for each of us personally, as you may want, but it can keep Urgals \\nand other abominations from overrunning this,” he searched vaguely for the \\nright term, “place.”\\nThe trader \\ncontinued, “You’re angry with the Empire for treating people unfairly, a \\nlegitimate concern, but a government cannot please everyone. There will \\ninevitably be arguments and conflicts. However, the majority of us have nothing \\nto complain about. Every country has some small group of malcontents who aren’t \\nsatisfied with the balance of power.”\\n“Yeah,” called a \\nwoman, “if you’re willing to call the Varden small!”\\nThe fat man \\nsighed. “We already explained that the Varden have no interest in helping you. \\nThat’s only a falsehood perpetuated by the traitors in an attempt to disrupt \\nthe Empire and convince us that the real threat is inside—not outside—our \\nborders. All they want to do is overthrow the king and take possession of our \\nland. They have spies everywhere as they prepare to invade. You never know who \\nmight be working for them.”\\nEragon did not \\nagree, but the traders’ words were smooth, and people were nodding. He stepped \\nforward and said, “How do you know this? I can say that clouds are green, but \\nthat doesn’t mean it’s true. Prove you aren’t lying.” The two men glared at him \\nwhile the villagers waited silently for the answer.\\nThe thin trader \\nspoke first. He avoided Eragon’s eyes. “Aren’t your children taught respect? Or \\ndo you let boys challenge men whenever they want to?”\\nThe listeners \\nfidgeted and stared at Eragon. Then a man said, “Answer the question.”\\n“It’s only \\ncommon sense,” said the fat one, sweat beading on his upper lip. His reply \\nriled the villagers, and the dispute resumed.\\nEragon returned \\nto the bar with a sour taste in his mouth. He had never before met anyone who \\nfavored the Empire and tore down its enemies. There was a deep-seated hatred of \\nthe Empire in Carvahall, almost hereditary in nature. The Empire never helped \\nthem during harsh years when they nearly starved, and its tax collectors were \\nheartless. He felt justified in disagreeing with the traders regarding the \\nking’s mercy, but he did speculate about the Varden.\\nThe Varden were \\na rebel group that constantly raided and attacked the Empire. It was a mystery \\nwho their leader was or who had formed them in the years following Galbatorix’s \\nrise to power over a century ago. The group had garnered much sympathy as they \\neluded Galbatorix’s efforts to destroy them. Little was known about the Varden \\nexcept that if you were a fugitive and had to hide, or if you hated the Empire, \\nthey would accept you. The only problem was finding them.\\nMorn leaned over \\nthe bar and said, “Incredible, isn’t it? They’re worse than vultures circling a \\ndying animal. There’s going to be trouble if they stay much longer.”\\n“For us or for \\nthem?”\\n“Them,” said \\nMorn as angry voices filled the tavern. Eragon left when the argument \\nthreatened to become violent. The door thudded shut behind him, cutting off the \\nvoices. It was early evening, and the sun was sinking rapidly; the houses cast \\nlong shadows on the ground. As Eragon headed down the street, he noticed Roran \\nand Katrina standing in an alley.\\nRoran said \\nsomething Eragon could not hear. Katrina looked down at her hands and answered \\nin an undertone, then leaned up on her tiptoes and kissed him before darting \\naway. Eragon trotted to Roran and teased, “Having a good time?” Roran grunted \\nnoncommittally as he paced away.\\n“Have you heard \\nthe traders’ news?” asked Eragon, following. Most of the villagers were \\nindoors, talking to traders or waiting until it was dark enough for the \\ntroubadours to perform.\\n“Yes.” Roran \\nseemed distracted. “What do you think of Sloan?”\\n“I thought it \\nwas obvious.”\\n“There’ll be \\nblood between us when he finds out about Katrina and me,” stated Roran. A \\nsnowflake landed on Eragon’s nose, and he looked up. The sky had turned gray. \\nHe could think of nothing appropriate to say; Roran was right. He clasped his \\ncousin on the shoulder as they continued down the byway.\\nDinner at \\nHorst’s was hearty. The room was full of conversation and laughter. Sweet \\ncordials and heavy ales were consumed in copious amounts, adding to the \\nboisterous atmosphere. When the plates were empty, Horst’s guests left the \\nhouse and strolled to the field where the traders were camped. A ring of poles \\ntopped with candles had been stuck into the ground around a large clearing. \\nBonfires blazed in the background, painting the ground with dancing shadows. \\nThe villagers slowly gathered around the circle and waited expectantly in the \\ncold.\\nThe troubadours \\ncame tumbling out of their tents, dressed in tasseled clothing, followed by \\nolder and more stately minstrels. The minstrels provided music and narration as \\ntheir younger counterparts acted out the stories. The first plays were pure \\nentertainment: bawdy and full of jokes, pratfalls, and ridiculous characters. \\nLater, however, when the candles sputtered in their sockets and everyone was \\ndrawn together into a tight circle, the old storyteller Brom stepped forward. A \\nknotted white beard rippled over his chest, and a long black cape was wrapped \\naround his bent shoulders, obscuring his body. He spread his arms with hands \\nthat reached out like talons and recited thus:\\n\\xa0\\n“The sands of \\ntime cannot be stopped. Years pass whether we will them or not . . . but we can \\nremember. What has been lost may yet live on in memories. That which you will \\nhear is imperfect and fragmented, yet treasure it, for without you it does not \\nexist. I give you now a memory that has been forgotten, hidden in the dreamy \\nhaze that lies behind us.”\\nHis keen eyes \\ninspected their interested faces. His gaze lingered on Eragon last of all.\\n“Before your \\ngrandfathers’ fathers were born, and yea, even before their fathers, the Dragon \\nRiders were formed. To protect and guard was their mission, and for thousands \\nof years they succeeded. Their prowess in battle was unmatched, for each had \\nthe strength of ten men. They were immortal unless blade or poison took them. \\nFor good only were their powers used, and under their tutelage tall cities and \\ntowers were built out of the living stone. While they kept peace, the land \\nflourished. It was a golden time. The elves were our allies, the dwarves our \\nfriends. Wealth flowed into our cities, and men prospered. But weep . . . for \\nit could not last.”\\nBrom looked down \\nsilently. Infinite sadness resonated in his voice.\\n“Though no enemy \\ncould destroy them, they could not guard against themselves. And it came to \\npass at the height of their power that a boy, Galbatorix by name, was born in \\nthe province of Inzilbêth, which is no more. At ten he was tested, as was the \\ncustom, and it was found that great power resided in him. The Riders accepted \\nhim as their own.\\n“Through their \\ntraining he passed, exceeding all others in skill. Gifted with a sharp mind and \\nstrong body, he quickly took his place among the Riders’ ranks. Some saw his \\nabrupt rise as dangerous and warned the others, but the Riders had grown \\narrogant in their power and ignored caution. Alas, sorrow was conceived that \\nday.\\n“So it was that \\nsoon after his training was finished, Galbatorix took a reckless trip with two \\nfriends. Far north they flew, night and day, and passed into the Urgals’ \\nremaining territory, foolishly thinking their new powers would protect them. \\nThere on a thick sheet of ice, unmelted even in summer, they were ambushed in \\ntheir sleep. Though his friends and their dragons were butchered and he suffered \\ngreat wounds, Galbatorix slew his attackers. Tragically, during the fight a \\nstray arrow pierced his dragon’s heart. Without the arts to save her, she died \\nin his arms. Then were the seeds of madness planted.”\\nThe storyteller \\nclasped his hands and looked around slowly, shadows flickering across his worn \\nface. The next words came like the mournful toll of a requiem.\\n“Alone, bereft \\nof much of his strength and half mad with loss, Galbatorix wandered without \\nhope in that desolate land, seeking death. It did not come to him, though he \\nthrew himself without fear against any living thing. Urgals and other monsters \\nsoon fled from his haunted form. During this time he came to realize that the \\nRiders might grant him another dragon. Driven by this thought, he began the \\narduous journey, on foot, back through the Spine. Territory he had soared over \\neffortlessly on a dragon’s back now took him months to traverse. He could hunt \\nwith magic, but oftentimes he walked in places where animals did not travel. \\nThus when his feet finally left the mountains, he was close to death. A farmer \\nfound him collapsed in the mud and summoned the Riders.\\n“Unconscious, he \\nwas taken to their holdings, and his body healed. He slept for four days. Upon \\nawakening he gave no sign of his fevered mind. When he was brought before a \\ncouncil convened to judge him, Galbatorix demanded another dragon. The \\ndesperation of the request revealed his dementia, and the council saw him for \\nwhat he truly was. Denied his hope, Galbatorix, through the twisted mirror of \\nhis madness, came to believe it was the Riders’ fault his dragon had died. \\nNight after night he brooded on that and formulated a plan to exact revenge.”\\nBrom’s words \\ndropped to a mesmerizing whisper.\\n“He found a \\nsympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent \\nreasoning and the use of dark secrets learned from a Shade, he inflamed the \\nRider against their elders. Together they treacherously lured and killed an \\nelder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his ally and slaughtered \\nhim without warning. The Riders found him, then, with blood dripping from his \\nhands. A scream tore from his lips, and he fled into the night. As he was \\ncunning in his madness, they could not find him.\\n“For years he \\nhid in wastelands like a hunted animal, always watching for pursuers. His \\natrocity was not forgotten, but over time searches ceased. Then through some \\nill fortune he met a young Rider, Morzan—strong of body, but weak of mind. \\nGalbatorix convinced Morzan to leave a gate unbolted in the citadel Ilirea, \\nwhich is now called Urû’baen. Through this gate Galbatorix entered and stole a \\ndragon hatchling.\\n“He and his new \\ndisciple hid themselves in an evil place where the Riders dared not venture. \\nThere Morzan entered into a dark apprenticeship, learning secrets and forbidden \\nmagic that should never have been revealed. When his instruction was finished \\nand Galbatorix’s black dragon, Shruikan, was fully grown, Galbatorix revealed \\nhimself to the world, with Morzan at his side. Together they fought any Rider \\nthey met. With each kill their strength grew. Twelve of the Riders joined \\nGalbatorix out of desire for power and revenge against perceived wrongs. Those \\ntwelve, with Morzan, became the Thirteen Forsworn. The Riders were unprepared \\nand fell beneath the onslaught. The elves, too, fought bitterly against \\nGalbatorix, but they were overthrown and forced to flee to their secret places, \\nfrom whence they come no more.\\n“Only Vrael, \\nleader of the Riders, could resist Galbatorix and the Forsworn. Ancient and wise, \\nhe struggled to save what he could and keep the remaining dragons from falling \\nto his enemies. In the last battle, before the gates of Dorú Areaba, Vrael \\ndefeated Galbatorix, but hesitated with the final blow. Galbatorix seized the \\nmoment and smote him in the side. Grievously wounded, Vrael fled to Utgard \\nMountain, where he hoped to gather strength. But it was not to be, for \\nGalbatorix found him. As they fought, Galbatorix kicked Vrael in the fork of \\nhis legs. With that underhanded blow, he gained dominance over Vrael and \\nremoved his head with a blazing sword.\\n“Then as power \\nrushed through his veins, Galbatorix anointed himself king over all Alagaësia.\\n“And from that \\nday, he has ruled us.”\\n\\xa0\\nWith the \\ncompletion of the story, Brom shuffled away with the troubadours. Eragon \\nthought he saw a tear shining on his cheek. People murmured quietly to each \\nother as they departed. Garrow said to Eragon and Roran, “Consider yourselves \\nfortunate. I have heard this tale only twice in my life. If the Empire knew that \\nBrom had recited it, he would not live to see a new month.”\\nF ATE’SGIFT\\nThe evening after \\ntheir return from Carvahall, Eragon decided to test the stone as Merlock had. \\nAlone in his room, he set it on his bed and laid three tools next to it. He \\nstarted with a wooden mallet and lightly tapped the stone. It produced a subtle \\nringing. Satisfied, he picked up the next tool, a heavy leather hammer. A \\nmournful peal reverberated when it struck. Lastly, he pounded a small chisel \\nagainst it. The metal did not chip or scratch the stone, but it produced the \\nclearest sound yet. As the final note died away, he thought he heard a faint \\nsqueak.\\nMerlock said the \\nstone was hollow; there could be something of value inside. I don’t know how to \\nopen it, though. There must have been a good reason for someone to shape it, \\nbut whoever sent the stone into the Spine hasn’t taken the trouble to retrieve \\nit or doesn’t know where it is. But I don’t believe that a magician with enough \\npower to transport the stone wouldn’t be able to find it again. So was I meant \\nto have it?He \\ncould not answer the question. Resigned to an unsolvable mystery, he picked up \\nthe tools and returned the stone to its shelf.\\n\\xa0\\nThat night he \\nwas abruptly roused from sleep. He listened carefully. All was quiet. Uneasy, \\nhe slid his hand under the mattress and grasped his knife. He waited a few \\nminutes, then slowly sank back to sleep.\\nA squeak pierced \\nthe silence, tearing him back to wakefulness. He rolled out of bed and yanked \\nthe knife from its sheath. Fumbling with a tinderbox, he lit a candle. The door \\nto his room was closed. Though the squeak was too loud for a mouse or rat, he \\nstill checked under the bed. Nothing. He sat on the edge of the mattress and \\nrubbed the sleep from his eyes. Another squeak filled the air, and he started \\nviolently.\\nWhere was the \\nnoise was coming from? Nothing could be in the floor or walls; they were solid \\nwood. The same went for his bed, and he would have noticed if anything had \\ncrawled into his straw mattress during the night. His eyes settled on the \\nstone. He took it off the shelf and absently cradled it as he studied the room. \\nA squeak rang in his ears and reverberated through his fingers; it came from \\nthe stone.\\nThe stone had \\ngiven him nothing but frustration and anger, and now it would not even let him \\nsleep! It ignored his furious glare and sat solidly, occasionally peeping. Then \\nit gave one very loud squeak and fell silent. Eragon warily put it away and got \\nback under the sheets. Whatever secret the stone held, it would have to wait until \\nmorning.\\nThe moon was \\nshining through his window when he woke again. The stone was rocking rapidly on \\nthe shelf, knocking against the wall. It was bathed in cool moonlight that \\nbleached its surface. Eragon jumped out of bed, knife in hand. The motion stopped, \\nbut he remained tense. Then the stone started squeaking and rocking faster than \\never.\\nWith an oath, he \\nbegan dressing. He did not care how valuable the stone might be; he was going \\nto take it far away and bury it. The rocking stopped; the stone became quiet. \\nIt quivered, then rolled forward and dropped onto the floor with a loud thump. \\nHe inched toward the door in alarm as the stone wobbled toward him.\\nSuddenly a crack \\nappeared on the stone. Then another and another. Transfixed, Eragon leaned \\nforward, still holding the knife. At the top of the stone, where all the cracks \\nmet, a small piece wobbled, as if it were balanced on something, then rose and \\ntoppled to the floor. After another series of squeaks, a small dark head poked \\nout of the hole, followed by a weirdly angled body. Eragon gripped the knife \\ntighter and held very still. Soon the creature was all the way out of the \\nstone. It stayed in place for a moment, then skittered into the moonlight.\\nEragon recoiled \\nin shock. Standing in front of him, licking off the membrane that encased it, \\nwas a dragon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA WAKENING \\nThe dragon was no \\nlonger than his forearm, yet it was dignified and noble. Its scales were deep \\nsapphire blue, the same color as the stone. But not a stone, he realized, an \\negg. The dragon fanned its wings; they were what had made it appear so \\ncontorted. The wings were several times longer than its body and ribbed with \\nthin fingers of bone that extended from the wing’s front edge, forming a line \\nof widely spaced talons. The dragon’s head was roughly triangular. Two \\ndiminutive white fangs curved down out of its upper jaw. They looked very \\nsharp. Its claws were also white, like polished ivory, and slightly serrated on \\nthe inside curve. A line of small spikes ran down the creature’s spine from the \\nbase of its head to the tip of its tail. A hollow where its neck and shoulders \\njoined created a larger-than-normal gap between the spikes.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly, and the dragon’s head snapped around. Hard, ice-blue eyes fixed on \\nhim. He kept very still. It might be a formidable enemy if it decided to \\nattack.\\nThe dragon lost \\ninterest in Eragon and awkwardly explored the room, squealing as it bumped into \\na wall or furniture. With a flutter of wings, it leapt onto the bed and crawled \\nto his pillow, squeaking. Its mouth was open pitifully, like a young bird’s, \\ndisplaying rows of pointed teeth. Eragon sat cautiously on the end of the bed. \\nThe dragon smelled his hand, nibbled his sleeve. He pulled his arm back.\\nA smile tugged \\nat Eragon’s lips as he looked at the small creature. Tentatively, he reached \\nout with his right hand and touched its flank. A blast of icy energy surged \\ninto his hand and raced up his arm, burning in his veins like liquid fire. He \\nfell back with a wild cry. An iron clang filled his ears, and he heard a \\nsoundless scream of rage. Every part of his body seared with pain. He struggled \\nto move, but was unable to. After what seemed like hours, warmth seeped back \\ninto his limbs, leaving them tingling. Shivering uncontrollably, he pushed \\nhimself upright. His hand was numb, his fingers paralyzed. Alarmed, he watched \\nas the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffused white oval. The skin \\nitched and burned like a spider bite. His heart pounded frantically.\\nEragon blinked, \\ntrying to understand what had occurred. Something brushed against his \\nconsciousness, like a finger trailing over his skin. He felt it again, but this \\ntime it solidified into a tendril of thought through which he could feel a \\ngrowing curiosity. It was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had \\nfallen away, and he was now free to reach out with his mind. He was afraid that \\nwithout anything to hold him back, he would float out of his body and be unable \\nto return, becoming a spirit of the ether. Scared, he pulled away from the \\ncontact. The new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes. He glared \\nsuspiciously at the motionless dragon.\\nA scaly leg \\nscraped against his side, and he jerked back. But the energy did not shock him \\nagain. Puzzled, he rubbed the dragon’s head with his right hand. A light \\ntingling ran up his arm. The dragon nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat. \\nHe slid a finger over its thin wing membranes. They felt like old parchment, \\nvelvety and warm, but still slightly damp. Hundreds of slender veins pulsed through \\nthem.\\nAgain the \\ntendril touched his mind, but this time, instead of curiosity, he sensed an \\noverpowering, ravenous hunger. He got up with a sigh. This was a dangerous \\nanimal, of that he was sure. Yet it seemed so helpless crawling on his bed, he \\ncould only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it. The dragon wailed in a \\nreedy tone as it looked for food. Eragon quickly scratched its head to keep it \\nquiet.I’ll think about this later, he decided, and left the room, \\ncarefully closing the door.\\nReturning with \\ntwo strips of dried meat, he found the dragon sitting on the windowsill, \\nwatching the moon. He cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the \\ndragon. It smelled the square cautiously, then jabbed its head forward like a \\nsnake and snatched the meat from his fingers, swallowing it whole with a \\npeculiar jerk. The dragon prodded Eragon’s hand for more food.\\nHe fed it, \\ncareful to keep his fingers out of the way. By the time there was only one \\nsquare left, the dragon’s belly was bulging. He proffered the last piece; the \\ndragon considered it for a moment, then lazily snapped it up. Done eating, it \\ncrawled onto his arm and curled against his chest. Then it snorted, a puff of \\ndark smoke rising from its nostrils. Eragon looked at it with wonder.\\nJust when he \\nthought the dragon was asleep, a low humming came from its vibrating throat. \\nGently, he carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow. The dragon, eyes \\nclosed, wrapped its tail around the bedpost contentedly. Eragon lay next to it, \\nflexing his hand in the near darkness.\\nHe faced a \\npainful dilemma: By raising a dragon, he could become a Rider. Myths and \\nstories about Riders were treasured, and being one would automatically place \\nhim among those legends. However, if the Empire discovered the dragon, he and \\nhis family would be put to death unless he joined the king. No one could—or \\nwould—help them. The simplest solution was just to kill the dragon, but the \\nidea was repugnant, and he rejected it. Dragons were too revered for him to \\neven consider that.Besides, what could betray us? he thought.We live \\nin a remote area and have done nothing to draw attention.\\nThe problem was \\nconvincing Garrow and Roran to let him keep the dragon. Neither of them would \\ncare to have a dragon around.I could raise it in secret. In a month or two \\nit will be too large for Garrow to get rid of, but will he accept it? Even if \\nhe does, can I get enough food for the dragon while it’s hiding? It’s no larger \\nthan a small cat, but it ate an entire handful of meat! I suppose it’ll be able \\nto hunt for itself eventually, but how long until then? Will it be able to \\nsurvive the cold outside? All the same, he wanted the dragon. The more he \\nthought about it, the surer he was. However things might work out with Garrow, \\nEragon would do everything he could to protect it. Determined, he fell asleep \\nwith the dragon cradled against him.\\nWhen dawn came, \\nthe dragon was sitting atop his bedpost, like an ancient sentinel welcoming the \\nnew day. Eragon marveled at its color. He had never seen such a clear, hard \\nblue. Its scales were like hundreds of small gemstones. He noticed that the \\nwhite oval on his palm, where he had touched the dragon, had a silvery sheen. \\nHe hoped he could hide it by keeping his hands dirty.\\nThe dragon \\nlaunched off the post and glided to the floor. Eragon gingerly picked it up and \\nleft the quiet house, pausing to grab meat, several leather strips, and as many \\nrags as he could carry. The crisp morning was beautiful; a fresh layer of snow \\ncovered the farm. He smiled as the small creature looked around with interest \\nfrom the safety of his arms.\\nHurrying across \\nthe fields, he walked silently into the dark forest, searching for a safe place \\nfor the dragon to stay. Eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a \\nbarren knoll, its branches snow-tipped gray fingers that reached toward the \\nsky. He set the dragon down by the base of the trunk and shook the leather onto \\nthe ground.\\nWith a few deft \\nmovements, he made a noose and slipped it over the dragon’s head as it explored \\nthe snowy clumps surrounding the tree. The leather was worn, but it would hold. \\nHe watched the dragon crawl around, then untied the noose from its neck and \\nfashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the dragon would not strangle \\nitself. Next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the \\nbranches, layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat. Snow fell on his \\nface as the tree swayed. He hung more rags over the front of the shelter to \\nkeep heat inside. Pleased, he surveyed his work.\\n“Time to show \\nyou your new home,” he said, and lifted the dragon up into the branches. It \\nwriggled, trying to get free, then clambered into the hut, where it ate a piece \\nof meat, curled up, and blinked coyly at him. “You’ll be fine as long as you \\nstay in here,” he instructed. The dragon blinked again.\\nSure that it had \\nnot understood him, Eragon groped with his mind until he felt the dragon’s \\nconsciousness. Again he had the terrible feeling ofopenness —of a space \\nso large it pressed down on him like a heavy blanket. Summoning his strength, \\nhe focused on the dragon and tried to impress on it one idea:Stay here. \\nThe dragon stopped moving and cocked its head at him. He pushed harder:Stay \\nhere. A dim acknowledgment came tentatively through the link, but Eragon \\nwondered if it really understood.After all, it’s only an animal. He \\nretreated from the contact with relief and felt the safety of his own mind \\nenvelop him.\\nEragon left the \\ntree, casting glances backward. The dragon stuck its head out of the shelter \\nand watched with large eyes as he left.\\nAfter a hurried \\nwalk home, he sneaked back into his room to dispose of the egg fragments. He \\nwas sure Garrow and Roran would not notice the egg’s absence—it had faded from \\ntheir thoughts after they learned it could not be sold. When his family got up, \\nRoran mentioned that he had heard some noises during the night but, to Eragon’s \\nrelief, did not pursue the issue.\\nEragon’s \\nenthusiasm made the day go by quickly. The mark on his hand proved easy to \\nhide, so he soon stopped worrying about it. Before long he headed back to the \\nrowan, carrying sausages he had pilfered from the cellar. With apprehension, he \\napproached the tree.Is the dragon able to survive outside in winter?\\nHis fears were \\ngroundless. The dragon was perched on a branch, gnawing on something between \\nits front legs. It started squeaking excitedly when it saw him. He was pleased \\nto see that it had remained in the tree, above the reach of large predators. As \\nsoon as he dropped the sausages at the base of the trunk, the dragon glided \\ndown. While it voraciously tore apart the food, Eragon examined the shelter. \\nAll the meat he had left was gone, but the hut was intact, and tufts of \\nfeathers littered the floor.Good. It can get its own food.\\nIt struck him \\nthat he did not know if the dragon was a he or a she. He lifted and turned it \\nover, ignoring its squeals of displeasure, but was unable to find any \\ndistinguishing marks.It seems like it won’t give up any secrets without a struggle.\\nHe spent a long \\ntime with the dragon. He untied it, set it on his shoulder, and went to explore \\nthe woods. The snow-laden trees watched over them like solemn pillars of a \\ngreat cathedral. In that isolation, Eragon showed the dragon what he knew about \\nthe forest, not caring if it understood his meaning. It was the simple act of \\nsharing that mattered. He talked to it continuously. The dragon gazed back at \\nhim with bright eyes, drinking in his words. For a while he just sat with it \\nresting in his arms and watched it with wonder, still stunned by recent events. \\nEragon started for home at sunset, conscious of two hard blue eyes drilling \\ninto his back, indignant at being left behind.\\nThat night he \\nbrooded about all the things that could happen to a small and unprotected \\nanimal. Thoughts of ice storms and vicious animals tormented him. It took hours \\nfor him to find sleep. His dreams were of foxes and black wolves tearing at the \\ndragon with bloody teeth.\\nIn the sunrise \\nglow, Eragon ran from the house with food and scraps of cloth—extra insulation \\nfor the shelter. He found the dragon awake and safe, watching the sunrise from \\nhigh in the tree. He fervently thanked all the gods, known and unknown. The \\ndragon came down to the ground as he approached and leapt into his arms, \\nhuddling close to his chest. The cold had not harmed it, but it seemed \\nfrightened. A puff of dark smoke blew out of its nostrils. He stroked it \\ncomfortingly and sat with his back to the rowan, murmuring softly. He kept \\nstill as the dragon buried its head in his coat. After a while it crawled out \\nof his embrace and onto his shoulder. He fed it, then wrapped the new rags \\naround the hut. They played together for a time, but Eragon had to return to \\nthe house before long.\\n\\xa0\\nA smooth routine \\nwas quickly established. Every morning Eragon ran out to the tree and gave the \\ndragon breakfast before hurrying back. During the day he attacked his chores \\nuntil they were finished and he could visit the dragon again. Both Garrow and \\nRoran noted his behavior and asked why he spent so much time outside. Eragon \\njust shrugged and started checking to make sure he was not followed to the \\ntree.\\nAfter the first \\nfew days he stopped worrying that a mishap would befall the dragon. Its growth \\nwas explosive; it would soon be safe from most dangers. The dragon doubled in \\nsize in the first week. Four days later it was as high as his knee. It no \\nlonger fit inside the hut in the rowan, so Eragon was forced to build a hidden \\nshelter on the ground. The task took him three days.\\nWhen the dragon \\nwas a fortnight old, Eragon was compelled to let it roam free because it needed \\nso much food. The first time he untied it, only the force of his will kept it \\nfrom following him back to the farm. Every time it tried, he pushed it away \\nwith his mind until it learned to avoid the house and its other inhabitants.\\nAnd he impressed \\non the dragon the importance of hunting only in the Spine, where there was less \\nchance of being seen. Farmers would notice if game started disappearing from \\nPalancar Valley. It made him feel both safer and uneasy when the dragon was so \\nfar away.\\nThe mental \\ncontact he shared with the dragon waxed stronger each day. He found that \\nalthough it did not comprehend words, he could communicate with it through \\nimages or emotions. It was an imprecise method, however, and he was often \\nmisunderstood. The range at which they could touch each other’s thoughts \\nexpanded rapidly. Soon Eragon could contact the dragon anywhere within three \\nleagues. He often did so, and the dragon, in turn, would lightly brush against \\nhis mind. These mute conversations filled his working hours. There was always a \\nsmall part of him connected to the dragon, ignored at times, but never \\nforgotten. When he talked with people, the contact was distracting, like a fly \\nbuzzing in his ear.\\nAs the dragon \\nmatured, its squeaks deepened to a roar and the humming became a low rumble, \\nyet the dragon did not breathe fire, which concerned him. He had seen it blow \\nsmoke when it was upset, but there was never a hint of flame.\\nWhen the month \\nended, Eragon’s elbow was level with the dragon’s shoulder. In that brief span, \\nit had transformed from a small, weak animal into a powerful beast. Its hard \\nscales were as tough as chain-mail armor, its teeth like daggers.\\nEragon took long \\nwalks in the evening with the dragon padding beside him. When they found a \\nclearing, he would settle against a tree and watch the dragon soar through the \\nair. He loved to see it fly and regretted that it was not yet big enough to \\nride. He often sat beside the dragon and rubbed its neck, feeling sinews and \\ncorded muscles flex under his hands.\\nDespite Eragon’s \\nefforts, the forest around the farm filled with signs of the dragon’s \\nexistence. It was impossible to erase all the huge four-clawed footprints sunk \\ndeep in the snow, and he refused even to try to hide the giant dung heaps that \\nwere becoming far too common. The dragon had rubbed against trees, stripping \\noff the bark, and had sharpened its claws on dead logs, leaving gashes inches \\ndeep. If Garrow or Roran went too far beyond the farm’s boundaries, they would \\ndiscover the dragon. Eragon could imagine no worse way for the truth to come \\nout, so he decided to preempt it by explaining everything to them.\\nHe wanted to do \\ntwo things first, though: give the dragon a suitable name and learn more about \\ndragons in general. To that end he needed to talk with Brom, master of epics \\nand legends—the only places where dragonlore survived.\\nSo when Roran \\nwent to get a chisel repaired in Carvahall, Eragon volunteered to go with him.\\n\\xa0\\nThe evening \\nbefore they left, Eragon went to a small clearing in the forest and called the \\ndragon with his mind. After a moment he saw a fast-moving speck in the dusky \\nsky. The dragon dived toward him, pulled up sharply, then leveled off above the \\ntrees. He heard a low-pitched whistle as air rushed over its wings. It banked \\nslowly to his left and spiraled gently down to the ground. The dragon \\nback-flapped for balance with a deep, muffledthwump as it landed.\\nEragon opened \\nhis mind, still uncomfortable with the strange sensation, and told the dragon \\nthat he was leaving. It snorted with unease. He attempted to soothe it with a \\ncalming mental picture, but the dragon whipped its tail, unsatisfied. He rested \\nhis hand on its shoulder and tried to radiate peace and serenity. Scales bumped \\nunder his fingers as he patted it gently.\\nA single word \\nrang in his head, deep and clear.\\nEragon. \\nIt was solemn \\nand sad, as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed. He stared at the dragon \\nand a cold tingle ran down his arm.\\nEragon. \\nA hard knot \\nformed in his stomach as unfathomable sapphire eyes gazed back at him. For the \\nfirst time he did not think of the dragon as an animal. It was something else, \\nsomething . . . different. He raced home, trying to escape the dragon.My \\ndragon.\\nEragon. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT EA FORTWO\\nRoran and Eragon \\nparted at the outskirts of Carvahall. Eragon walked slowly to Brom’s house, \\nengrossed in his thoughts. He stopped at the doorstep and raised his hand to \\nknock.\\nA voice rasped, \\n“What do you want, boy?”\\nHe whirled \\naround. Behind him Brom leaned on a twisted staff embellished with strange \\ncarvings. He wore a brown hooded robe like a friar. A pouch hung from the \\nscuffed leather belt clasped around his waist. Above his white beard, a proud \\neagle nose hooked over his mouth and dominated his face. He peered at Eragon \\nwith deep-set eyes shadowed by a gnarled brow and waited for his reply.\\n“To get \\ninformation,” Eragon said. “Roran is getting a chisel fixed and I had free \\ntime, so I came to see if you could answer a few questions.”\\nThe old man \\ngrunted and reached for the door. Eragon noticed a gold ring on his right hand. \\nLight glinted off a sapphire, highlighting a strange symbol carved on its face. \\n“You might as well come in; we’ll be talking awhile. Your questions never seem \\nto end.” Inside, the house was darker than charcoal, an acrid smell heavy in \\nthe air. “Now, for a light.” Eragon heard the old man move around, then a low \\ncurse as something crashed to the floor. “Ah, here we go.” A white spark \\nflashed; a flame wavered into existence.\\nBrom stood with \\na candle before a stone fireplace. Stacks of books surrounded a high-backed, \\ndeeply carved wooden chair that faced the mantel; the four legs were shaped \\nlike eagle claws, and the seat and back were padded with leather embossed with \\na swirling rose pattern. A cluster of lesser chairs held piles of scrolls. Ink \\npots and pens were scattered across a writing desk. “Make room for yourself, \\nbut by the lost kings, becareful . This stuff is valuable.”\\nEragon stepped \\nover pages of parchment covered with angular runes. He gently lifted cracking \\nscrolls off a chair and placed them on the floor. A cloud of dust flew into the \\nair as he sat. He stifled a sneeze.\\nBrom bent down \\nand lit the fire with his candle. “Good! Nothing like sitting by a fire for \\nconversation.” He threw back his hood to reveal hair that was not white, but \\nsilver, then hung a kettle over the flames and settled into the high-backed \\nchair.\\n“Now, what do \\nyou want?” He addressed Eragon roughly, but not unkindly.\\n“Well,” said \\nEragon, wondering how best to approach the subject, “I keep hearing about the \\nDragon Riders and their supposed accomplishments. Most everyone seems to want \\nthem to return, but I’ve never heard tell of how they were started, where the \\ndragons came from, or what made the Riders special—aside from the dragons.”\\n“A vast subject \\nto tell about,” grumbled Brom. He peered at Eragon alertly. “If I told you \\ntheir whole story, we would still be sitting here when winter comes again. It \\nwill have to be reduced to a manageable length. But before we start properly, I \\nneed my pipe.”\\nEragon waited \\npatiently as Brom tamped down the tobacco. He liked Brom. The old man was \\nirascible at times, but he never seemed to mind taking time for Eragon. Eragon \\nhad once asked him where he came from, and Brom had laughed, saying, “A village \\nmuch like Carvahall, only not quite as interesting.” Curiosity aroused, Eragon \\nasked his uncle. But Garrow could only tell him that Brom had bought a house in \\nCarvahall nearly fifteen years ago and had lived there quietly ever since.\\nBrom used a \\ntinderbox to light the pipe. He puffed a few times, then said, “There . . . we \\nwon’t have to stop, except for the tea. Now, about the Riders, or the \\nShur’tugal, as they are called by the elves. Where to start? They spanned \\ncountless years and, at the height of their power, held sway over twice the \\nEmpire’s lands. Numerous stories have been told about them, most nonsense. If \\nyou believed everything said, you would expect them to have the powers of a \\nlesser god. Scholars have devoted entire lives to separating these fictions \\nfrom fact, but it’s doubtful any of them will succeed. However, it isn’t an \\nimpossible task if we confine ourselves to the three areas you specified: how \\nthe Riders began, why they were so highly regarded, and where dragons came \\nfrom. I shall start with the last item.” Eragon settled back and listened to \\nthe man’s mesmerizing voice.\\n“Dragons have no \\nbeginning, unless it lies with the creation of Alagaësia itself. And if they \\nhave an end, it will be when this world perishes, for they suffer as the land \\ndoes. They, the dwarves, and a few others are the true inhabitants of this \\nland. They lived here before all others, strong and proud in their elemental \\nglory. Their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on \\ntheir silver ships.”\\n“Where did the \\nelves come from?” interrupted Eragon. “And why are they called the fair folk? \\nDo they really exist?”\\nBrom scowled. \\n“Do you want your original questions answered or not? They won’t be if you want \\nto explore every obscure piece of knowledge.”\\n“Sorry,” said \\nEragon. He dipped his head and tried to look contrite.\\n“No, you’re \\nnot,” said Brom with some amusement. He shifted his gaze to the fire and \\nwatched it lick the underside of the kettle. “If you must know, elves are not \\nlegends, and they are called the fair folk because they are more graceful than \\nany of the other races. They come from what they call Alalea, though none but \\nthey know what, or even where, it is.\\n“Now,” he glared \\nfrom under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more \\ninterruptions, “the elves were a proud race then, and strong in magic. At first \\nthey regarded dragons as mere animals. From that belief rose a deadly mistake. \\nA brash elven youth hunted down a dragon, as he would a stag, and killed it. \\nOutraged, the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf. Unfortunately, the \\nbloodletting did not stop there. The dragons massed together and attacked the \\nentire elven nation. Dismayed by the terrible misunderstanding, the elves tried \\nto end the hostilities, but couldn’t find a way to communicate with the \\ndragons.\\n“Thus, to \\ngreatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences, there was a very long \\nand very bloody war, which both sides later regretted. At the beginning the \\nelves fought only to defend themselves, for they were reluctant to escalate the \\nfighting, but the dragons’ ferocity eventually forced them to attack for their \\nown survival. This lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer \\nif an elf called Eragon hadn’t found a dragon egg.” Eragon blinked in surprise. \\n“Ah, I see you didn’t know of your namesake,” said Brom.\\n“No.” The \\nteakettle whistled stridently.Why was I named after an elf?\\n“Then you should \\nfind this all the more interesting,” said Brom. He hooked the kettle out of the \\nfire and poured boiling water into two cups. Handing one to Eragon, he warned, \\n“These leaves don’t need to steep long, so drink it quickly before it gets too \\nstrong.” Eragon tried a sip, but scalded his tongue. Brom set his own cup aside \\nand continued smoking the pipe.\\n“No one knows \\nwhy that egg was abandoned. Some say the parents were killed in an elven \\nattack. Others believe the dragons purposefully left it there. Either way, \\nEragon saw the value of raising a friendly dragon. He cared for it secretly \\nand, in the custom of the ancient language, named him Bid’Daum. When Bid’Daum \\nhad grown to a good size, they traveled together among the dragons and \\nconvinced them to live in peace with the elves. Treaties were formed between \\nthe two races. To ensure that war would never break out again, they decided \\nthat it was necessary to establish the Riders.\\n“At first the \\nRiders were intended merely as a means of communication between the elves and \\ndragons. However, as time passed, their worth was recognized and they were \\ngiven ever more authority. Eventually they took the island Vroengard for their \\nhome and built a city on it—Dorú Areaba. Before Galbatorix overthrew them, the \\nRiders held more power than all the kings in Alagaësia. Now I believe I have \\nanswered two of your questions.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon absently. It seemed like an incredible coincidence that he had been \\nnamed after the first Rider. For some reason his name did not feel the same \\nanymore. “What doesEragon mean?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Brom. “It’s very old. I doubt anyone remembers except the elves, and \\nfortune would have to smile greatly before you talked with one. It is a good \\nname to have, though; you should be proud of it. Not everyone has one so \\nhonorable.”\\nEragon brushed \\nthe matter from his mind and focused on what he had learned from Brom; there \\nwas something missing. “I don’t understand. Where were we when the Riders were \\ncreated?”\\n“We?” asked \\nBrom, raising an eyebrow.\\n“You know, all \\nof us.” Eragon waved his hands vaguely. “Humans in general.”\\nBrom laughed. \\n“We are no more native to this land than the elves. It took our ancestors \\nanother three centuries to arrive here and join the Riders.”\\n“That can’t be,” \\nprotested Eragon. “We’ve always lived in Palancar Valley.”\\n“That might be \\ntrue for a few generations, but beyond that, no. It isn’t even true for you, \\nEragon,” said Brom gently. “Though you consider yourself part of Garrow’s \\nfamily, and rightly so, your sire was not from here. Ask around and you’ll find \\nmany people who haven’t been here that long. This valley is old and hasn’t \\nalways belonged to us.”\\nEragon scowled \\nand gulped at the tea. It was still hot enough to burn his throat. This was his \\nhome, regardless of who his father was! “What happened to the dwarves after the \\nRiders were destroyed?”\\n“No one really \\nknows. They fought with the Riders through the first few battles, but when it \\nbecame clear Galbatorix was going to win, they sealed all the known entrances \\nto their tunnels and disappeared underground. As far as I know, not one has \\nbeen seen since.”\\n“And the \\ndragons?” he asked. “What of them? Surely they weren’t all killed.”\\nBrom answered \\nsorrowfully, “That is the greatest mystery in Alagaësia nowadays: How many \\ndragons survived Galbatorix’s murderous slaughter? He spared those who agreed \\nto serve him, but only the twisted dragons of the Forsworn would assist his \\nmadness. If any dragons aside from Shruikan are still alive, they have hidden \\nthemselves so they will never be found by the Empire.”\\nSo wheredidmy dragon \\ncome from?wondered Eragon. “Were the Urgals here when the elves came to \\nAlagaësia?” he asked.\\n“No, they \\nfollowed the elves across the sea, like ticks seeking blood. They were one of \\nthe reasons the Riders became valued for their battle prowess and ability to \\nkeep the peace. . . . Much can be learned from this history. It’s a pity the \\nking makes it a delicate subject,” reflected Brom.\\n“Yes, I heard \\nyour story the last time I was in town.”\\n“Story!” roared \\nBrom. Lightning flashed in his eyes. “If it is a story, then the rumors of my \\ndeath are true and you are speaking with a ghost! Respect the past; you never \\nknow how it may affect you.”\\nEragon waited \\nuntil Brom’s face mellowed before he dared ask, “How big were the dragons?”\\nA dark plume of \\nsmoke swirled above Brom like a miniature thunderstorm. “Larger than a house. \\nEven the small ones had wingspans over a hundred feet; they never stopped \\ngrowing. Some of the ancient ones, before the Empire killed them, could have \\npassed for large hills.”\\nDismay swept \\nthrough Eragon.How can I hide my dragon in the years to come? He raged \\nsilently, but kept his voice calm. “When did they mature?”\\n“Well,” said \\nBrom, scratching his chin, “they couldn’t breathe fire until they were around \\nfive to six months old, which was about when they could mate. The older a \\ndragon was, the longer it could breathe fire. Some of them could keep at it for \\nminutes.” Brom blew a smoke ring and watched it float up to the ceiling.\\n“I heard that \\ntheir scales shone like gems.”\\nBrom leaned forward \\nand growled, “You heard right. They came in every color and shade. It was said \\nthat a group of them looked like a living rainbow, constantly shifting and \\nshimmering. But who told you that?”\\nEragon froze for \\na second, then lied, “A trader.”\\n“What was his \\nname?” asked Brom. His tangled eyebrows met in a thick white line; the wrinkles \\ndeepened on his forehead. Unnoticed, the pipe smoldered out.\\nEragon pretended \\nto think. “I don’t know. He was talking in Morn’s, but I never found out who he \\nwas.”\\n“I wish you \\nhad,” muttered Brom.\\n“He also said a \\nRider could hear his dragon’s thoughts,” said Eragon quickly, hoping that the \\nfictitious trader would protect him from suspicion.\\nBrom’s eyes \\nnarrowed. Slowly he took out a tinderbox and struck the flint. Smoke rose, and \\nhe took a long pull from the pipe, exhaling slowly. In a flat voice he said, \\n“He was wrong. It isn’t in any of the stories, and I know them all. Did he say \\nanything else?”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“No.” Brom was too interested in the trader for him to continue the falsehood. \\nCasually he inquired, “Did dragons live very long?”\\nBrom did not \\nrespond at once. His chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe \\nthoughtfully, light reflecting off his ring. “Sorry, my mind was elsewhere. \\nYes, a dragon will live for quite a while, forever, in fact, as long as it \\nisn’t killed and its Rider doesn’t die.”\\n“How does anyone \\nknow that?” objected Eragon. “If dragons die when their Riders do, they could \\nonly live to be sixty or seventy. You said during your . . . narration that \\nRiders lived for hundreds of years, but that’s impossible.” It troubled him to \\nthink of outliving his family and friends.\\nA quiet smile \\ncurled Brom’s lips as he said slyly, “What is possible is subjective. Some \\nwould say that you cannot travel through the Spine and live, yet you do. It’s a \\nmatter of perspective. You must be very wise to know so much at such a young \\nage.” Eragon flushed, and the old man chuckled. “Don’t be angry; you can’t be \\nexpected to know such things. You forget that the dragons were magical—they \\naffected everything around them in strange ways. The Riders were closest to \\nthem and experienced this the most. The most common side effect was an extended \\nlife. Our king has lived long enough to make that apparent, but most people \\nattribute it to his own magical abilities. There were also other, less \\nnoticeable changes. All the Riders were stronger of body, keener of mind, and \\ntruer of sight than normal men. Along with this, a human Rider would slowly \\nacquire pointed ears, though they were never as prominent as an elf’s.”\\nEragon had to \\nstop his hand from reaching up to feel the tips of his ears.How else will \\nthis dragon change my life? Not only has it gotten inside my head, but it’s \\naltering my body as well! “Were dragons very smart?”\\n“Didn’t you pay \\nattention to what I told you earlier!” demanded Brom. “How could the elves form \\nagreements and peace treaties with dumb brutes? They were as intelligent as you \\nor I.”\\n“But they were \\nanimals,” persisted Eragon.\\nBrom snorted. \\n“They were no more animals than we are. For some reason people praise \\neverything the Riders did, yet ignore the dragons, assuming that they were \\nnothing more than an exotic means to get from one town to another. They \\nweren’t. The Riders’ great deeds were only possible because of the dragons. How \\nmany men would draw their swords if they knew a giant fire-breathing lizard—one \\nwith more natural cunning and wisdom than even a king could hope for—would soon \\nbe there to stop the violence? Hmm?” He blew another smoke ring and watched it \\nwaft away.\\n“Did you ever \\nsee one?”\\n“Nay,” said \\nBrom, “it was long before my time.”\\nAnd now for a \\nname.“I’ve \\nbeen trying to recall the name of a certain dragon, but it keeps eluding me. I \\nthink I heard it when the traders were in Carvahall, but I’m not sure. Could \\nyou help me?”\\nBrom shrugged \\nand quickly listed a stream of names. “There was Jura, Hírador, and Fundor—who \\nfought the giant sea snake. Galzra, Briam, Ohen the Strong, Gretiem, Beroan, \\nRoslarb . . .” He added many others. At the very end, he uttered so softly \\nEragon almost did not hear, “. . . and Saphira.” Brom quietly emptied his pipe. \\n“Was it any of those?”\\n“I’m afraid \\nnot,” said Eragon. Brom had given him much to think about, and it was getting \\nlate. “Well, Roran’s probably finished with Horst. I should get back, though \\nI’d rather not.”\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “What, is that it? I expected to be answering your questions until he \\ncame looking for you. No queries about dragon battle tactics or requests for \\ndescriptions of breathtaking aerial combat? Are we done?”\\n“For now,” \\nlaughed Eragon. “I learned what I wanted to and more.” He stood and Brom \\nfollowed.\\n“Very well, \\nthen.” He ushered Eragon to the door. “Goodbye. Take care. And don’t forget, if \\nyou remember who that trader was, tell me.”\\n“I will. Thank \\nyou.” Eragon stepped into the glaring winter sunlight, squinting. He slowly \\npaced away, pondering what he had heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAN AME OFPOWER\\nOn the way home \\nRoran said, “There was a stranger from Therinsford at Horst’s today.”\\n“What’s his \\nname?” asked Eragon. He sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a \\nbrisk pace. His cheeks and eyes burned from the cold.\\n“Dempton. He \\ncame here to have Horst forge him some sockets,” said Roran. His stocky legs \\nplowed through a drift, clearing the way for Eragon.\\n“Doesn’t \\nTherinsford have its own smith?”\\n“Yes,” replied \\nRoran, “but he isn’t skilled enough.” He glanced at Eragon. With a shrug he \\nadded, “Dempton needs the sockets for his mill. He’s expanding it and offered \\nme a job. If I accept, I’ll leave with him when he picks up the sockets.”\\nMillers worked \\nall year. During winter they ground whatever people brought them, but in \\nharvest season they bought grain and sold it as flour. It was hard, dangerous \\nwork; workers often lost fingers or hands to the giant millstones. “Are you \\ngoing to tell Garrow?” asked Eragon.\\n“Yes.” A grimly \\namused smile played across Roran’s face.\\n“What for? You \\nknow what he thinks about us going away. It’ll only cause trouble if you say \\nanything. Forget about it so we can eat tonight’s dinner in peace.”\\n“I can’t. I’m \\ngoing to take the job.”\\nEragon halted. \\n“Why?” They faced each other, their breath visible in the air. “I know money is \\nhard to come by, but we always manage to survive. You don’t have to leave.”\\n“No, I don’t. \\nBut the money is for myself.” Roran tried to resume walking, but Eragon refused \\nto budge.\\n“What do you \\nneed it for?” he demanded.\\nRoran’s \\nshoulders straightened slightly. “I want to marry.”\\nBewilderment and \\nastonishment overwhelmed Eragon. He remembered seeing Katrina and Roran kissing \\nduring the traders’ visit, but marriage? “Katrina?” he asked weakly, just to \\nconfirm. Roran nodded. “Have you asked her?”\\n“Not yet, but \\ncome spring, when I can raise a house, I will.”\\n“There’s too \\nmuch work on the farm for you to leave now,” protested Eragon. “Wait until \\nwe’re ready for planting.”\\n“No,” said \\nRoran, laughing slightly. “Spring’s the time I’ll be needed the most. The \\nground will have to be furrowed and sown. The crops must be weeded—not to \\nmention all the other chores. No, this is the best time for me to go, when all \\nwe really do is wait for the seasons to change. You and Garrow can make do \\nwithout me. If all goes well, I’ll soon be back working on the farm, with a \\nwife.”\\nEragon \\nreluctantly conceded that Roran made sense. He shook his head, but whether with \\namazement or anger, he knew not. “I guess I can only wish you the best of luck. \\nBut Garrow may take this with ill humor.”\\n“We will see.”\\nThey resumed \\nwalking, the silence a barrier between them. Eragon’s heart was disturbed. It \\nwould take time before he could look upon this development with favor. When \\nthey arrived home, Roran did not tell Garrow of his plans, but Eragon was sure \\nthat he soon would.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon went to \\nsee the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him. He approached \\napprehensively, aware now that it was an equal.\\nEragon. \\n“Is that all you \\ncan say?” he snapped.\\nYes. \\nHis eyes widened \\nat the unexpected reply, and he sat down roughly.Now it has a sense of \\nhumor. What next? Impulsively, he broke a dead branch with his foot. \\nRoran’s announcement had put him in a foul mood. A questioning thought came \\nfrom the dragon, so he told it what had happened. As he talked his voice grew \\nsteadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air. He ranted until \\nhis emotions were spent, then ineffectually punched the ground.\\n“I don’t want \\nhim to go, that’s all,” he said helplessly. The dragon watched impassively, \\nlistening and learning. Eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes. \\nHe looked at the dragon thoughtfully. “You need a name. I heard some \\ninteresting ones today; perhaps you’ll like one.” He mentally ran through the \\nlist Brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic, \\nnoble, and pleasing to the ear. “What do you think of Vanilor or his successor, \\nEridor? Both were great dragons.”\\nNo,said the dragon. \\nIt sounded amused with his efforts.Eragon.\\n“That’smy \\nname; you can’t have it,” he said, rubbing his chin. “Well, if you don’t like \\nthose, there are others.” He continued through the list, but the dragon \\nrejected every one he proposed. It seemed to be laughing at something Eragon \\ndid not understand, but he ignored it and kept suggesting names. “There was \\nIngothold, he slew the . . .” A revelation stopped him.That’s the problem! \\nI’ve been choosing male names. You are a she!\\nYes.The dragon \\nfolded her wings smugly.\\nNow that he knew \\nwhat to look for, he came up with half a dozen names. He toyed with Miremel, \\nbut that did not fit—after all, it was the name of a brown dragon. Opheila and \\nLenora were also discarded. He was about to give up when he remembered the last \\nname Brom had muttered. Eragon liked it, but would the dragon?\\nHe asked.\\n“Are you \\nSaphira?” She looked at him with intelligent eyes. Deep in his mind he felt her \\nsatisfaction.\\nYes.Something \\nclicked in his head and her voice echoed, as if from a great distance. He \\ngrinned in response. Saphira started humming.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAM ILLER-TO-BE\\nThe sun had set \\nby the time dinner was served. A blustery wind howled outside, shaking the \\nhouse. Eragon eyed Roran closely and waited for the inevitable. Finally: “I was \\noffered a job at Therinsford’s mill . . . which I plan to take.”\\nGarrow finished \\nhis mouthful of food with deliberate slowness and laid down his fork. He leaned \\nback in his chair, then interlaced his fingers behind his head and uttered one \\ndry word, “Why?”\\nRoran explained \\nwhile Eragon absently picked at his food.\\n“I see,” was \\nGarrow’s only comment. He fell silent and stared at the ceiling. No one moved \\nas they awaited his response. “Well, when do you leave?”\\n“What?” asked \\nRoran.\\nGarrow leaned \\nforward with a twinkle in his eye. “Did you think I would stop you? I’d hoped \\nyou would marry soon. It will be good to see this family growing again. Katrina \\nwill be lucky to have you.” Astonishment raced over Roran’s face, then he \\nsettled into a relieved grin. “So when do you leave?” Garrow asked.\\nRoran regained \\nhis voice. “When Dempton returns to get the sockets for the mill.”\\nGarrow nodded. \\n“And that will be in . . . ?”\\n“Two weeks.”\\n“Good. That will \\ngive us time to prepare. It’ll be different to have the house to ourselves. But \\nif nothing goes amiss, it shouldn’t be for too long.” He looked over the table \\nand asked, “Eragon, did you know of this?”\\nHe shrugged \\nruefully. “Not until today. . . . It’s madness.”\\nGarrow ran a \\nhand over his face. “It’s life’s natural course.” He pushed himself up from the \\nchair. “All will be fine; time will settle everything. For now, though, let’s \\nclean the dishes.” Eragon and Roran helped him in silence.\\n\\xa0\\nThe next few \\ndays were trying. Eragon’s temper was frayed. Except for curtly answering \\ndirect questions, he spoke with no one. There were small reminders everywhere \\nthat Roran was leaving: Garrow making him a pack, things missing from the \\nwalls, and a strange emptiness that filled the house. It was almost a week \\nbefore he realized that distance had grown between Roran and him. When they \\nspoke, the words did not come easily and their conversations were \\nuncomfortable.\\nSaphira was a \\nbalm for Eragon’s frustration. He could talk freely with her; his emotions were \\ncompletely open to her mind, and she understood him better than anyone else. \\nDuring the weeks before Roran’s departure, she went through another growth \\nspurt. She gained twelve inches at the shoulder, which was now higher than \\nEragon’s. He found that the small hollow where her neck joined her shoulders \\nwas a perfect place to sit. He often rested there in the evenings and scratched \\nher neck while he explained the meanings of different words. Soon she \\nunderstood everything he said and frequently commented on it.\\nFor Eragon, this \\npart of his life was delightful. Saphira was as real and complex as any person. \\nHer personality was eclectic and at times completely alien, yet they understood \\neach other on a profound level. Her actions and thoughts constantly revealed \\nnew aspects of her character. Once she caught an eagle and, instead of eating \\nit, released it, saying,No hunter of the sky should end his days as prey. \\nBetter to die on the wing than pinned to the ground.\\nEragon’s plan to \\nlet his family see Saphira was dispelled by Roran’s announcement and Saphira’s \\nown cautionary words. She was reluctant to be seen, and he, partly out of selfishness, \\nagreed. The moment her existence was divulged, he knew that shouts, \\naccusations, and fear would be directed at him . . . so he procrastinated. He \\ntold himself to wait for a sign that it was the right time.\\nThe night before \\nRoran was to leave, Eragon went to talk with him. He stalked down the hallway \\nto Roran’s open door. An oil lamp rested on a nightstand, painting the walls \\nwith warm flickering light. The bedposts cast elongated shadows on empty \\nshelves that rose to the ceiling. Roran—his eyes shaded and the back of his \\nneck tense—was rolling blankets around his clothes and belongings. He paused, \\nthen picked up something from the pillow and bounced it in his hand. It was a \\npolished rock Eragon had given him years ago. Roran started to tuck it into the \\nbundle, then stopped and set it on a shelf. A hard lump formed in Eragon’s \\nthroat, and he left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nS TRANGERS INCARVAHALL\\nBreakfast was \\ncold, but the tea was hot. Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning \\nfire and soaked into the wood floor, staining it with dark puddles. Eragon \\nlooked at Garrow and Roran by the kitchen stove and reflected that this would \\nbe the last time he saw them together for many months.\\nRoran sat in a \\nchair, lacing his boots. His full pack rested on the floor next to him. Garrow \\nstood between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets. His shirt hung \\nloosely; his skin looked drawn. Despite the young men’s cajoling, he refused to \\ngo with them. When pressed for a reason, he only said that it was for the best.\\n“Do you have \\neverything?” Garrow asked Roran.\\n“Yes.”\\nHe nodded and \\ntook a small pouch from his pocket. Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran. \\n“I’ve been saving this for you. It isn’t much, but if you wish to buy some \\nbauble or trinket, it will suffice.”\\n“Thank you, but \\nI won’t be spending my money on trifles,” said Roran.\\n“Do what you \\nwill; it is yours,” said Garrow. “I’ve nothing else to give you, except a \\nfather’s blessing. Take it if you wish, but it is worth little.”\\nRoran’s voice \\nwas thick with emotion. “I would be honored to receive it.”\\n“Then do, and go \\nin peace,” said Garrow, and kissed him on the forehead. He turned and said in a \\nlouder voice, “Do not think that I have forgotten you, Eragon. I have words for \\nboth of you. It’s time I said them, as you are entering the world. Heed them \\nand they will serve you well.” He bent his gaze sternly on them. “First, let no \\none rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain \\nunfettered. One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave. Give \\nmen your ear, but not your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don’t \\nfollow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not.\\n“Consider none \\nyour superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they \\nwill seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and \\nothers will listen.” He continued at a slower pace, “Of the affairs of love . . \\n. my only advice is to be honest. That’s your most powerful tool to unlock a \\nheart or gain forgiveness. That is all I have to say.” He seemed slightly \\nself-conscious of his speech.\\nHe hoisted \\nRoran’s pack. “Now you must go. Dawn is approaching, and Dempton will be \\nwaiting.”\\nRoran shouldered \\nthe pack and hugged Garrow. “I will return as soon as I can,” he said.\\n“Good!” replied \\nGarrow. “But now go and don’t worry about us.”\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. Eragon and Roran went outside, then turned and waved. Garrow \\nraised a bony hand, his eyes grave, and watched as they trudged to the road. \\nAfter a long moment he shut the door. As the sound carried through the morning \\nair, Roran halted.\\nEragon looked \\nback and surveyed the land. His eyes lingered on the lone buildings. They \\nlooked pitifully small and fragile. A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the \\nhouse was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited.\\n“There is our \\nwhole world,” Roran observed somberly.\\nEragon shivered \\nimpatiently and grumbled, “A good one too.” Roran nodded, then straightened his \\nshoulders and headed into his new future. The house disappeared from view as \\nthey descended the hill.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was still \\nearly when they reached Carvahall, but they found the smithy doors already \\nopen. The air inside was pleasantly warm. Baldor slowly worked two large \\nbellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals. \\nBefore the forge stood a black anvil and an iron-bound barrel filled with \\nbrine. From a line of neck-high poles protruding from the walls hung rows of \\nitems: giant tongs, pliers, hammers in every shape and weight, chisels, angles, \\ncenter punches, files, rasps, lathes, bars of iron and steel waiting to be \\nshaped, vises, shears, picks, and shovels. Horst and Dempton stood next to a \\nlong table.\\nDempton \\napproached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache. “Roran! I’m glad \\nyou came. There’s going to be more work than I can handle with my new \\ngrindstones. Are you ready to go?”\\nRoran hefted his \\npack. “Yes. Do we leave soon?”\\n“I’ve a few \\nthings to take care of first, but we’ll be off within the hour.” Eragon shifted \\nhis feet as Dempton turned to him, tugging at the corner of his mustache. “You \\nmust be Eragon. I would offer you a job too, but Roran got the only one. Maybe \\nin a year or two, eh?”\\nEragon smiled \\nuneasily and shook his hand. The man was friendly. Under other circumstances \\nEragon would have liked him, but right then, he sourly wished that the miller \\nhad never come to Carvahall. Dempton huffed. “Good, very good.” He returned his \\nattention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked.\\n“They’re ready \\nto go,” interrupted Horst, gesturing at the table where several bundles rested. \\n“You can take them whenever you want to.” They shook hands, then Horst left the \\nsmithy, beckoning to Eragon on the way out.\\nInterested, \\nEragon followed. He found the smith standing in the street with his arms \\ncrossed. Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked, “What do you \\nthink of him?”\\nHorst rumbled, \\n“A good man. He’ll do fine with Roran.” He absently brushed metal filings off \\nhis apron, then put a massive hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Lad, do you remember \\nthe fight you had with Sloan?”\\n“If you’re \\nasking about payment for the meat, I haven’t forgotten.”\\n“No, I trust \\nyou, lad. What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone.”\\nEragon’s heart \\nfluttered.Why does he want to know? Maybe someone saw Saphira! \\nStruggling not to panic, he said, “I do, but why do you ask?”\\n“As soon as you \\nreturn home, get rid of it.” Horst overrode Eragon’s exclamation. “Two men \\narrived here yesterday. Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords. \\nIt made my skin crawl just to look at them. Last evening they started asking \\npeople if a stone like yours had been found. They’re at it again today.” Eragon \\nblanched. “No one with any sense said anything. They know trouble when they see \\nit, but I could name a few people who will talk.”\\nDread filled \\nEragon’s heart. Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked \\nit down. Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira. He did not know which \\nwould be worse.Think! Think! The egg is gone. It’s impossible for them to \\nfind it now. But if they know what it was, it’ll be obvious what happened. . . \\n. Saphira might be in danger! It took all of his self-control to retain a \\ncasual air. “Thanks for telling me. Do you know where they are?” He was proud \\nthat his voice barely trembled.\\n“I didn’t warn \\nyou because I thought you needed to meet those men! Leave Carvahall. Go home.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid Eragon to placate the smith, “if you think I should.”\\n“I do.” Horst’s \\nface softened. “I may be overreacting, but these strangers give me a bad \\nfeeling. It would be better if you stay home until they leave. I’ll try to keep \\nthem away from your farm, though it may not do any good.”\\nEragon looked at \\nhim gratefully. He wished he could tell him about Saphira. “I’ll leave now,” he \\nsaid, and hurried back to Roran. Eragon clasped his cousin’s arm and bade him \\nfarewell.\\n“Aren’t you \\ngoing to stay awhile?” Roran asked with surprise.\\nEragon almost \\nlaughed. For some reason, the question struck him as funny. “There’s nothing \\nfor me to do, and I’m not going to stand around until you go.”\\n“Well,” said \\nRoran doubtfully, “I guess this is the last time we’ll see each other for a few \\nmonths.”\\n“I’m sure it \\nwon’t seem that long,” said Eragon hastily. “Take care and come back soon.” He \\nhugged Roran, then left. Horst was still in the street. Aware that the smith \\nwas watching, Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall. Once the smithy was \\nout of sight, he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village.\\nEragon kept to \\nthe shadows as he searched each street, listening for the slightest noise. His \\nthoughts flashed to his room, where his bow hung; he wished that it was in his \\nhand. He prowled across Carvahall, avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant \\nvoice from around a house. Although his ears were keen, he had to strain to \\nhear what was being said.\\n“When did this \\nhappen?” The words were smooth, like oiled glass, and seemed to worm their way \\nthrough the air. Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp \\nprickle.\\n“About three \\nmonths ago,” someone else answered. Eragon identified him as Sloan.\\nShade’s blood, \\nhe’s telling them. . . .He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met.\\nA third person \\nspoke. The voice was deep and moist. It conjured up images of creeping decay, \\nmold, and other things best left untouched. “Are you sure? We would hate to \\nthink you had made a mistake. If that were so, it would be most . . . \\nunpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do. Would \\nanyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that? Probably not, but whoever \\nsent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity.\\n“Yeah, I’m sure. \\nHe had it then. I’m not lying. Plenty of people know about it. Go ask them.” \\nSloan sounded shaken. He said something else that Eragon did not catch.\\n“They have been \\n. . . rather uncooperative.” The words were derisive. There was a pause. “Your \\ninformation has been helpful. We will not forget you.” Eragon believed him.\\nSloan muttered \\nsomething, then Eragon heard someone hurrying away. He peered around the corner \\nto see what was happening. Two tall men stood in the street. Both were dressed \\nin long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs. On \\ntheir shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread. Hoods \\nshaded their faces, and their hands were covered by gloves. Their backs were \\noddly humped, as though their clothes were stuffed with padding.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly to get a better view. One of the strangers stiffened and grunted \\npeculiarly to his companion. They both swiveled around and sank into crouches. \\nEragon’s breath caught. Mortal fear clenched him. His eyes locked onto their \\nhidden faces, and a stifling power fell over his mind, keeping him in place. He \\nstruggled against it and screamed to himself,Move! His legs swayed, but \\nto no avail. The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth, noiseless gait. He \\nknew they could see his face now. They were almost to the corner, hands \\ngrasping at swords. . . .\\n“Eragon!” He \\njerked as his name was called. The strangers froze in place and hissed. Brom \\nhurried toward him from the side, head bare and staff in hand. The strangers \\nwere blocked from the old man’s view. Eragon tried to warn him, but his tongue \\nand arms would not stir. “Eragon!” cried Brom again. The strangers gave Eragon \\none last look, then slipped away between the houses.\\nEragon collapsed \\nto the ground, shivering. Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms \\nsticky. The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm. \\n“You look sick; is all well?”\\nEragon gulped \\nand nodded mutely. His eyes flickered around, searching for anything unusual. \\n“I just got dizzy all of a sudden . . . it’s passed. It was very odd—I don’t \\nknow why it happened.”\\n“You’ll \\nrecover,” said Brom, “but perhaps it would be better if you went home.”\\nYes, I have to \\nget home! Have to get there before they do.“I think you’re right. Maybe I’m \\ngetting ill.”\\n“Then home is \\nthe best place for you. It’s a long walk, but I’m sure you will feel better by \\nthe time you arrive. Let me escort you to the road.” Eragon did not protest as \\nBrom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace. Brom’s staff crunched in \\nthe snow as they passed the houses.\\n“Why were you \\nlooking for me?”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“Simple curiosity. I learned you were in town and wondered if you had \\nremembered the name of that trader.”\\nTrader? What’s \\nhe talking about?Eragon \\nstared blankly; his confusion caught the attention of Brom’s probing eyes. \\n“No,” he said, and then amended himself, “I’m afraid I still don’t remember.”\\nBrom sighed \\ngruffly, as if something had been confirmed, and rubbed his eagle nose. “Well, \\nthen . . . if you do, come tell me. I am most interested in this trader who \\npretends to know so much about dragons.” Eragon nodded with a distracted air. \\nThey walked in silence to the road, then Brom said, “Hasten home. I don’t think \\nit would be a good idea to tarry on the way.” He offered a gnarled hand.\\nEragon shook it, \\nbut as he let go something in Brom’s hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off. \\nIt fell to the ground. The old man picked it up. “Clumsy of me,” he apologized, \\nand handed it back. As Eragon took the mitt, Brom’s strong fingers wrapped \\naround his wrist and twisted sharply. His palm briefly faced upward, revealing \\nthe silvery mark. Brom’s eyes glinted, but he let Eragon yank his hand back and \\njam it into the mitt.\\n“Goodbye,” \\nEragon forced out, perturbed, and hurried down the road. Behind him he heard \\nBrom whistling a merry tune.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nSTRANGERS INCARVAHALL\\nBreakfast was \\ncold, but the tea was hot.

Take it if you wish, but it is worth little.”\\nRoran’s voice \\nwas thick with emotion. “I would be honored to receive it.”\\n“Then do, and go \\nin peace,” said Garrow, and kissed him on the forehead. He turned and said in a \\nlouder voice, “Do not think that I have forgotten you, Eragon. I have words for \\nboth of you. It’s time I said them, as you are entering the world. Heed them \\nand they will serve you well.” He bent his gaze sternly on them. “First, let no \\none rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain \\nunfettered. One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave. Give \\nmen your ear, but not your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don’t \\nfollow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not.\\n“Consider none \\nyour superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they \\nwill seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and \\nothers will listen.” He continued at a slower pace, “Of the affairs of love . . \\n. my only advice is to be honest. That’s your most powerful tool to unlock a \\nheart or gain forgiveness. That is all I have to say.” He seemed slightly \\nself-conscious of his speech.\\nHe hoisted \\nRoran’s pack. “Now you must go. Dawn is approaching, and Dempton will be \\nwaiting.”\\nRoran shouldered \\nthe pack and hugged Garrow. “I will return as soon as I can,” he said.\\n“Good!” replied \\nGarrow. “But now go and don’t worry about us.”\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. Eragon and Roran went outside, then turned and waved. Garrow \\nraised a bony hand, his eyes grave, and watched as they trudged to the road. \\nAfter a long moment he shut the door. As the sound carried through the morning \\nair, Roran halted.\\nEragon looked \\nback and surveyed the land. His eyes lingered on the lone buildings. They \\nlooked pitifully small and fragile. A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the \\nhouse was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited.\\n“There is our \\nwhole world,” Roran observed somberly.\\nEragon shivered \\nimpatiently and grumbled, “A good one too.” Roran nodded, then straightened his \\nshoulders and headed into his new future. The house disappeared from view as \\nthey descended the hill.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was still \\nearly when they reached Carvahall, but they found the smithy doors already \\nopen. The air inside was pleasantly warm. Baldor slowly worked two large \\nbellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals. \\nBefore the forge stood a black anvil and an iron-bound barrel filled with \\nbrine. From a line of neck-high poles protruding from the walls hung rows of \\nitems: giant tongs, pliers, hammers in every shape and weight, chisels, angles, \\ncenter punches, files, rasps, lathes, bars of iron and steel waiting to be \\nshaped, vises, shears, picks, and shovels. Horst and Dempton stood next to a \\nlong table.\\nDempton \\napproached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache. “Roran! I’m glad \\nyou came. There’s going to be more work than I can handle with my new \\ngrindstones. Are you ready to go?”\\nRoran hefted his \\npack. “Yes. Do we leave soon?”\\n“I’ve a few \\nthings to take care of first, but we’ll be off within the hour.” Eragon shifted \\nhis feet as Dempton turned to him, tugging at the corner of his mustache. “You \\nmust be Eragon. I would offer you a job too, but Roran got the only one. Maybe \\nin a year or two, eh?”\\nEragon smiled \\nuneasily and shook his hand. The man was friendly. Under other circumstances \\nEragon would have liked him, but right then, he sourly wished that the miller \\nhad never come to Carvahall. Dempton huffed. “Good, very good.” He returned his \\nattention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked.\\n“They’re ready \\nto go,” interrupted Horst, gesturing at the table where several bundles rested. \\n“You can take them whenever you want to.” They shook hands, then Horst left the \\nsmithy, beckoning to Eragon on the way out.\\nInterested, \\nEragon followed. He found the smith standing in the street with his arms \\ncrossed. Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked, “What do you \\nthink of him?”\\nHorst rumbled, \\n“A good man. He’ll do fine with Roran.” He absently brushed metal filings off \\nhis apron, then put a massive hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Lad, do you remember \\nthe fight you had with Sloan?”\\n“If you’re \\nasking about payment for the meat, I haven’t forgotten.”\\n“No, I trust \\nyou, lad. What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone.”\\nEragon’s heart \\nfluttered.Why does he want to know? Maybe someone saw Saphira! \\nStruggling not to panic, he said, “I do, but why do you ask?”\\n“As soon as you \\nreturn home, get rid of it.” Horst overrode Eragon’s exclamation. “Two men \\narrived here yesterday. Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords. \\nIt made my skin crawl just to look at them. Last evening they started asking \\npeople if a stone like yours had been found. They’re at it again today.” Eragon \\nblanched. “No one with any sense said anything. They know trouble when they see \\nit, but I could name a few people who will talk.”\\nDread filled \\nEragon’s heart. Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked \\nit down. Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira. He did not know which \\nwould be worse.Think! Think! The egg is gone. It’s impossible for them to \\nfind it now. But if they know what it was, it’ll be obvious what happened. . . \\n. Saphira might be in danger! It took all of his self-control to retain a \\ncasual air. “Thanks for telling me. Do you know where they are?” He was proud \\nthat his voice barely trembled.\\n“I didn’t warn \\nyou because I thought you needed to meet those men! Leave Carvahall. Go home.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid Eragon to placate the smith, “if you think I should.”\\n“I do.” Horst’s \\nface softened. “I may be overreacting, but these strangers give me a bad \\nfeeling. It would be better if you stay home until they leave. I’ll try to keep \\nthem away from your farm, though it may not do any good.”\\nEragon looked at \\nhim gratefully. He wished he could tell him about Saphira. “I’ll leave now,” he \\nsaid, and hurried back to Roran. Eragon clasped his cousin’s arm and bade him \\nfarewell.\\n“Aren’t you \\ngoing to stay awhile?” Roran asked with surprise.\\nEragon almost \\nlaughed. For some reason, the question struck him as funny. “There’s nothing \\nfor me to do, and I’m not going to stand around until you go.”\\n“Well,” said \\nRoran doubtfully, “I guess this is the last time we’ll see each other for a few \\nmonths.”\\n“I’m sure it \\nwon’t seem that long,” said Eragon hastily. “Take care and come back soon.” He \\nhugged Roran, then left. Horst was still in the street. Aware that the smith \\nwas watching, Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall. Once the smithy was \\nout of sight, he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village.\\nEragon kept to \\nthe shadows as he searched each street, listening for the slightest noise. His \\nthoughts flashed to his room, where his bow hung; he wished that it was in his \\nhand. He prowled across Carvahall, avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant \\nvoice from around a house. Although his ears were keen, he had to strain to \\nhear what was being said.\\n“When did this \\nhappen?” The words were smooth, like oiled glass, and seemed to worm their way \\nthrough the air. Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp \\nprickle.\\n“About three \\nmonths ago,” someone else answered. Eragon identified him as Sloan.\\nShade’s blood, \\nhe’s telling them. . . .He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met.\\nA third person \\nspoke. The voice was deep and moist. It conjured up images of creeping decay, \\nmold, and other things best left untouched. “Are you sure? We would hate to \\nthink you had made a mistake. If that were so, it would be most . . . \\nunpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do. Would \\nanyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that? Probably not, but whoever \\nsent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity.\\n“Yeah, I’m sure. \\nHe had it then. I’m not lying. Plenty of people know about it. Go ask them.” \\nSloan sounded shaken. He said something else that Eragon did not catch.\\n“They have been \\n. . . rather uncooperative.” The words were derisive. There was a pause. “Your \\ninformation has been helpful. We will not forget you.” Eragon believed him.\\nSloan muttered \\nsomething, then Eragon heard someone hurrying away. He peered around the corner \\nto see what was happening. Two tall men stood in the street. Both were dressed \\nin long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs. On \\ntheir shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread. Hoods \\nshaded their faces, and their hands were covered by gloves. Their backs were \\noddly humped, as though their clothes were stuffed with padding.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly to get a better view. One of the strangers stiffened and grunted \\npeculiarly to his companion. They both swiveled around and sank into crouches. \\nEragon’s breath caught. Mortal fear clenched him. His eyes locked onto their \\nhidden faces, and a stifling power fell over his mind, keeping him in place. He \\nstruggled against it and screamed to himself,Move! His legs swayed, but \\nto no avail. The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth, noiseless gait. He \\nknew they could see his face now. They were almost to the corner, hands \\ngrasping at swords. . . .\\n“Eragon!” He \\njerked as his name was called. The strangers froze in place and hissed. Brom \\nhurried toward him from the side, head bare and staff in hand. The strangers \\nwere blocked from the old man’s view. Eragon tried to warn him, but his tongue \\nand arms would not stir. “Eragon!” cried Brom again. The strangers gave Eragon \\none last look, then slipped away between the houses.\\nEragon collapsed \\nto the ground, shivering. Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms \\nsticky. The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm. \\n“You look sick; is all well?”\\nEragon gulped \\nand nodded mutely. His eyes flickered around, searching for anything unusual. \\n“I just got dizzy all of a sudden . . . it’s passed. It was very odd—I don’t \\nknow why it happened.”\\n“You’ll \\nrecover,” said Brom, “but perhaps it would be better if you went home.”\\nYes, I have to \\nget home! Have to get there before they do.“I think you’re right. Maybe I’m \\ngetting ill.”\\n“Then home is \\nthe best place for you. It’s a long walk, but I’m sure you will feel better by \\nthe time you arrive. Let me escort you to the road.” Eragon did not protest as \\nBrom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace. Brom’s staff crunched in \\nthe snow as they passed the houses.\\n“Why were you \\nlooking for me?”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“Simple curiosity. I learned you were in town and wondered if you had \\nremembered the name of that trader.”\\nTrader? What’s \\nhe talking about?Eragon \\nstared blankly; his confusion caught the attention of Brom’s probing eyes. \\n“No,” he said, and then amended himself, “I’m afraid I still don’t remember.”\\nBrom sighed \\ngruffly, as if something had been confirmed, and rubbed his eagle nose. “Well, \\nthen . . . if you do, come tell me. I am most interested in this trader who \\npretends to know so much about dragons.” Eragon nodded with a distracted air. \\nThey walked in silence to the road, then Brom said, “Hasten home. I don’t think \\nit would be a good idea to tarry on the way.” He offered a gnarled hand.\\nEragon shook it, \\nbut as he let go something in Brom’s hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off. \\nIt fell to the ground. The old man picked it up. “Clumsy of me,” he apologized, \\nand handed it back. As Eragon took the mitt, Brom’s strong fingers wrapped \\naround his wrist and twisted sharply. His palm briefly faced upward, revealing \\nthe silvery mark. Brom’s eyes glinted, but he let Eragon yank his hand back and \\njam it into the mitt.\\n“Goodbye,” \\nEragon forced out, perturbed, and hurried down the road. Behind him he heard \\nBrom whistling a merry tune.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nF LIGHT OFDESTINY\\nEragon’s mind \\nchurned as he sped on his way. He ran as fast as he could, refusing to stop \\neven when his breath came in great gasps. As he pounded down the cold road, he \\ncast out with his mind for Saphira, but she was too far away for him to \\ncontact. He thought about what to say to Garrow. There was no choice now; he \\nwould have to reveal Saphira.\\nHe arrived home, \\npanting for air and heart pounding. Garrow stood by the barn with the horses. \\nEragon hesitated. Should I talk to him now? He won’t believe me unless \\nSaphira is here—I’d better find her first.He slipped around the farm and \\ninto the forest.Saphira! he shouted with his thoughts.\\nI come,was the dim reply. \\nThrough the words he sensed her alarm. He waited impatiently, though it was not \\nlong before the sound of her wings filled the air. She landed amid a gout of \\nsmoke.What happened? she queried.\\nHe touched her \\nshoulder and closed his eyes. Calming his mind, he quickly told her what had \\noccurred. When he mentioned the strangers, Saphira recoiled. She reared and \\nroared deafeningly, then whipped her tail over his head. He scrambled back in \\nsurprise, ducking as her tail hit a snowdrift. Bloodlust and fear emanated from \\nher in great sickening waves.Fire! Enemies! Death! Murderers!\\nWhat’s wrong?He put all of \\nhis strength into the words, but an iron wall surrounded her mind, shielding \\nher thoughts. She let out another roar and gouged the earth with her claws, \\ntearing the frozen ground.Stop it! Garrow will hear!\\nOaths betrayed, \\nsouls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers! \\nFrantic, he \\nblocked out Saphira’s emotions and watched her tail. When it flicked past him, \\nhe dashed to her side and grabbed a spike on her back. Clutching it, he pulled \\nhimself into the small hollow at the base of her neck and held on tightly as \\nshe reared again. “Enough, Saphira!” he bellowed. Her stream of thoughts ceased \\nabruptly. He ran a hand over her scales. “Everything’s going to be all right.” \\nShe crouched and her wings rushed upward. They hung there for an instant, then \\ndrove down as she flung herself into the sky.\\nEragon yelled as \\nthe ground dropped away and they rose above the trees. Turbulence buffeted him, \\nsnatching the breath out of his mouth. Saphira ignored his terror and banked \\ntoward the Spine. Underneath, he glimpsed the farm and the Anora River. His \\nstomach convulsed. He tightened his arms around Saphira’s neck and concentrated \\non the scales in front of his nose, trying not to vomit as she continued to \\nclimb. When she leveled off, he gained the courage to glance around.\\nThe air was so \\ncold that frost accumulated on his eyelashes. They had reached the mountains faster \\nthan he thought possible. From the air, the peaks looked like giant razor-sharp \\nteeth waiting to slash them to ribbons. Saphira wobbled unexpectedly, and \\nEragon heaved over her side. He wiped his lips, tasting bile, and buried his \\nhead against her neck.\\nWe have to go \\nback,he \\npleaded.The strangers are coming to the farm.Garrow has to be warned. Turn \\naround! There was no answer. He reached for her mind, but was blocked by a \\nbarrier of roiling fear and anger. Determined to make her turn around, he grimly \\nwormed into her mental armor. He pushed at its weak places, undermined the \\nstronger sections, and fought to make her listen, but to no avail.\\nSoon mountains \\nsurrounded them, forming tremendous white walls broken by granite cliffs. Blue \\nglaciers sat between the summits like frozen rivers. Long valleys and ravines \\nopened beneath them. He heard the dismayed screech of birds far below as \\nSaphira soared into view. He saw a herd of woolly goats bounding from ledge to \\nledge on a rocky bluff.\\nEragon was \\nbattered by swirling gusts from Saphira’s wings, and whenever she moved her \\nneck, he was tossed from side to side. She seemed tireless. He was afraid she \\nwas going to fly through the night. Finally, as darkness fell, she tilted into \\na shallow dive.\\nHe looked ahead and \\nsaw that they were headed for a small clearing in a valley. Saphira spiraled \\ndown, leisurely drifting over the treetops. She pulled back as the ground \\nneared, filled her wings with air, and landed on her rear legs. Her powerful \\nmuscles rippled as they absorbed the shock of impact. She dropped to all fours \\nand skipped a step to keep her balance. Eragon slid off without waiting for her \\nto fold her wings.\\nAs he struck the \\nground, his knees buckled, and his cheek slammed against the snow. He gasped as \\nexcruciating pain seared through his legs, sending tears to his eyes. His \\nmuscles, cramped from clenching for so long, shook violently. He rolled onto \\nhis back, shivering, and stretched his limbs as best he could. Then he forced \\nhimself to look down. Two large blots darkened his wool pants on the insides of \\nhis thighs. He touched the fabric. It was wet. Alarmed, he peeled off the pants \\nand grimaced. The insides of his legs were raw and bloody. The skin was gone, \\nrubbed off by Saphira’s hard scales. He gingerly felt the abrasions and winced. \\nCold bit into him as he pulled the pants back on, and he cried out as they \\nscraped against the sensitive wounds. He tried to stand, but his legs would not \\nsupport him.\\nThe deepening \\nnight obscured his surroundings; the shaded mountains were unfamiliar. I’m \\nin the Spine, I don’t know where, during the middle of winter, with a crazed \\ndragon, unable to walk or find shelter. Night is falling. I have to get back to \\nthe farm tomorrow. And the only way to do that is to fly, which I can’t endure \\nanymore.He took a deep breath.Oh, I wish Saphira could breathe fire. \\nHe turned his head and saw her next to him, crouched low to the ground. He put \\na hand on her side and found it trembling. The barrier in her mind was gone. \\nWithout it, her fear scorched through him. He clamped down on it and slowly \\nsoothed her with gentle images.Why do the strangers frighten you?\\nMurderers, she hissed.\\nGarrow is in \\ndanger and you kidnap me on this ridiculous journey! Are you unable to protect \\nme?She \\ngrowled deeply and snapped her jaws.Ah, but if you think you can, why run?\\nDeath is a \\npoison.\\n\\nHe leaned on one \\nelbow and stifled his frustration.Saphira, look where we are! The sun is \\ndown, and your flight has stripped my legs as easily as I would scale a fish. \\nIs that what you wanted?\\nNo. \\nThen why did you \\ndo it?he \\ndemanded. Through his link with Saphira, he felt her regret for his pain, but \\nnot for her actions. She looked away and refused to answer. The icy temperature \\ndeadened Eragon’s legs; although it lessened the pain, he knew that his \\ncondition was not good. He changed tack.I’m going to freeze unless you make \\nme a shelter or hollow so I can stay warm. Even a pile of pine needles and \\nbranches would do.\\nShe seemed \\nrelieved that he had stopped interrogating her.There is no need. I will curl \\naround you and cover you with my wings—the fire inside me will stay the cold.\\nEragon let his \\nhead thump back on the ground.Fine, but scrape the snow off the ground. \\nIt’ll be more comfortable. In answer, Saphira razed a drift with her tail, \\nclearing it with one powerful stroke. She swept over the site again to remove \\nthe last few inches of hardened snow. He eyed the exposed dirt with distaste.I \\ncan’t walk over there. You’ll have to help me to it. Her head, larger than \\nhis torso, swung over him and came to rest by his side. He stared at her large, \\nsapphire-colored eyes and wrapped his hands around one of her ivory spikes. She \\nlifted her head and slowly dragged him to the bare spot.Gently, gently. \\nStars danced in his eyes as he slid over a rock, but he managed to hold on. \\nAfter he let go, Saphira rolled on her side, exposing her warm belly. He \\nhuddled against the smooth scales of her underside. Her right wing extended \\nover him and enclosed him in complete darkness, forming a living tent. Almost \\nimmediately the air began to lose its frigidity.\\nHe pulled his \\narms inside his coat and tied the empty sleeves around his neck. For the first \\ntime he noticed that hunger gnawed at his stomach. But it did not distract him \\nfrom his main worry: Could he get back to the farm before the strangers did? \\nAnd if not, what would happen?Even if I can force myself to ride Saphira \\nagain, it’ll be at least midafternoon before we get back. The strangers could \\nbe there long before that. He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slide \\ndown his face.What have I done?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEDOOM OFINNOCENCE\\nWhen Eragon \\nopened his eyes in the morning, he thought the sky had fallen. An unbroken \\nplane of blue stretched over his head and slanted to the ground. Still half \\nasleep, he reached out tentatively and felt a thin membrane under his fingers. \\nIt took him a long minute to realize what he was staring at. He bent his neck \\nslightly and glared at the scaly haunch his head rested on. Slowly he pushed \\nhis legs out from his fetal curl, scabs cracking. The pain had subsided some \\nfrom yesterday, but he shrank from the thought of walking. Burning hunger \\nreminded him of his missed meals. He summoned the energy to move and pounded \\nweakly on Saphira’s side. “Hey! Wake up!” he yelled.\\nShe stirred and \\nlifted her wing to admit a torrent of sunshine. He squinted as the snow \\nmomentarily blinded him. Beside him Saphira stretched like a cat and yawned, \\nflashing rows of white teeth. When Eragon’s eyes adjusted, he examined where \\nthey were. Imposing and unfamiliar mountains surrounded them, casting deep \\nshadows on the clearing. Off to one side, he saw a trail cut through the snow \\nand into the forest, where he could hear the muffled gurgling of a creek.\\nGroaning, he \\nstood and swayed, then stiffly hobbled to a tree. He grabbed one of its \\nbranches and threw his weight against it. It held, then broke with a loud \\ncrack. He ripped off the twigs, fit one end of the branch under his arm, and \\nplanted the other firmly in the ground. With the help of his improvised crutch, \\nhe limped to the iced-over creek. He broke through the hard shell and cupped \\nthe clear, bitter water. Sated, he returned to the clearing. As he emerged from \\nthe trees, he finally recognized the mountains and the lay of the land.\\nThis was where, \\namid deafening sound, Saphira’s egg had first appeared. He sagged against a \\nrough trunk. There could be no mistake, for now he saw the gray trees that had \\nbeen stripped of their needles in the explosion.How did Saphira know where \\nthis was? She was still in the egg. My memories must have given her enough \\ninformation to find it. He shook his head in silent astonishment.\\nSaphira was \\nwaiting patiently for him.Will you take me home? he asked her. She \\ncocked her head.I know you don’t want to, but you must. Both of us carry an \\nobligation to Garrow. He has cared for me and, through me, you. Would you \\nignore that debt? What will be said of us in years to come if we don’t \\nreturn—that we hid like cowards while my uncle was in danger? I can hear it \\nnow, the story of the Rider and his craven dragon! If there will be a fight, \\nlet’s face it and not shy away. You are a dragon! Even a Shade would run from \\nyou! Yet you crouch in the mountains like a frightened rabbit.\\nEragon meant to \\nanger her, and he succeeded. A growl rippled in her throat as her head jabbed \\nwithin a few inches of his face. She bared her fangs and glared at him, smoke \\ntrailing from her nostrils. He hoped that he had not gone too far. Her thoughts \\nreached him, red with anger.Blood will meet blood. I will fight. Our wyrds—our \\nfates—bind us, but try me not. I will take you because of debt owed, but into \\nfoolishness we fly.\\n“Foolishness or \\nnot,” he said into the air, “there is no choice—we must go.” He ripped his \\nshirt in half and stuffed a piece into each side of his pants. Gingerly, he \\nhoisted himself onto Saphira and took a tight hold on her neck.This time, \\nhe told her,fly lower and faster. Time is of the essence.\\nDon’t let go,she cautioned, \\nthen surged into the sky. They rose above the forest and leveled out \\nimmediately, barely staying above the branches. Eragon’s stomach lurched; he \\nwas glad it was empty.\\nFaster, faster,he urged. She \\nsaid nothing, but the beat of her wings increased. He screwed his eyes shut and \\nhunched his shoulders. He had hoped that the extra padding of his shirt would \\nprotect him, but every movement sent pangs through his legs. Soon lines of hot \\nblood trickled down his calves. Concern emanated from Saphira. She went even \\nfaster now, her wings straining. The land sped past, as if it were being pulled \\nout from under them. Eragon imagined that to someone on the ground, they were \\njust a blur.\\nBy early \\nafternoon, Palancar Valley lay before them. Clouds obscured his vision to the \\nsouth; Carvahall was to the north. Saphira glided down while Eragon searched \\nfor the farm. When he spotted it, fear jolted him. A black plume with orange \\nflames dancing at its base rose from the farm.\\nSaphira!He pointed.Get \\nme down there. Now!\\nShe locked her \\nwings and tilted into a steep dive, hurtling groundward at a frightening rate. \\nThen she altered her dive slightly so they sped toward the forest. He yelled \\nover the screaming air, “Land in the fields!” He held on tighter as they \\nplummeted. Saphira waited until they were only a hundred feet off the ground \\nbefore driving her wings downward in several powerful strokes. She landed \\nheavily, breaking his grip. He crashed to the ground, then staggered upright, \\ngasping for breath.\\nThe house had \\nbeen blasted apart. Timbers and boards that had been walls and roof were strewn \\nacross a wide area. The wood was pulverized, as if a giant hammer had smashed \\nit. Sooty shingles lay everywhere. A few twisted metal plates were all that \\nremained of the stove. The snow was perforated with smashed white crockery and \\nchunks of bricks from the chimney. Thick, oily smoke billowed from the barn, \\nwhich burned fiercely. The farm animals were gone, either killed or frightened \\naway.\\n“Uncle!” Eragon \\nran to the wreckage, hunting through the destroyed rooms for Garrow. There was \\nno sign of him. “Uncle!” Eragon cried again. Saphira walked around the house \\nand came to his side.\\nSorrow breeds \\nhere,she \\nsaid.\\n“This wouldn’t \\nhave happened if you hadn’t run away with me!”\\nYou would not be \\nalive if we had stayed. \\n“Look at this!” \\nhe screamed. “We could’ve warned Garrow! It’s your fault he didn’t get away!” \\nHe slammed his fist against a pole, splitting the skin on his knuckles. Blood \\ndripped down his fingers as he stalked out of the house. He stumbled to the \\npath that led to the road and bent down to examine the snow. Several tracks \\nwere before him, but his vision was blurry and he could barely see.Am I \\ngoing blind? he wondered. With a shaking hand, he touched his cheeks and \\nfound them wet.\\nA shadow fell on \\nhim as Saphira loomed overhead, sheltering him with her wings.Take comfort; \\nall may not be lost. He looked up at her, searching for hope.Examine the \\ntrail; my eyes see only two sets of prints. Garrow could not have been taken \\nfrom here.\\nHe focused on \\nthe trampled snow. The faint imprints of two pairs of leather boots headed \\ntoward the house. On top of those were traces of the same two sets of boots \\nleaving. And whoever had made the departing tracks had been carrying the same \\nweight as when they arrived.You’re right, Garrow has to be here! He \\nleapt to his feet and hurried back to the house.\\nI will search \\naround the buildings and in the forest,said Saphira.\\nEragon scrambled \\ninto the remains of the kitchen and frantically started digging through a pile \\nof rubble. Pieces of debris that he could not have moved normally now seemed to \\nshift on their own accord. A cupboard, mostly intact, stymied him for a second, \\nthen he heaved and sent it flying. As he pulled on a board, something rattled \\nbehind him. He spun around, ready for an attack.\\nA hand extended \\nfrom under a section of collapsed roof. It moved weakly, and he grasped it with \\na cry. “Uncle, can you hear me?” There was no response. Eragon tore at pieces \\nof wood, heedless of the splinters that pierced his hands. He quickly exposed \\nan arm and shoulder, but was barred by a heavy beam. He threw his shoulder at \\nit and shoved with every fiber of his being, but it defied his efforts. \\n“Saphira! I need you!”\\nShe came \\nimmediately. Wood cracked under her feet as she crawled over the ruined walls. \\nWithout a word she nosed past him and set her side against the beam. Her claws \\nsank into what was left of the floor; her muscles strained. With a grating \\nsound, the beam lifted, and Eragon rushed under it. Garrow lay on his stomach, \\nhis clothes mostly torn off. Eragon pulled him out of the rubble. As soon as \\nthey were clear, Saphira released the beam, leaving it to crash to the floor.\\nEragon dragged \\nGarrow out of the destroyed house and eased him to the ground. Dismayed, he \\ntouched his uncle gently. His skin was gray, lifeless, and dry, as if a fever \\nhad burned off any sweat. His lip was split, and there was a long scrape on his \\ncheekbone, but that was not the worst. Deep, ragged burns covered most of his \\nbody. They were chalky white and oozed clear liquid. A cloying, sickening smell \\nhung over him—the odor of rotting fruit. His breath came in short jerks, each \\none sounding like a death rattle.\\nMurderers,hissed Saphira.\\nDon’t say that. \\nHe can still be saved! We have to get him to Gertrude. I can’t carry him to \\nCarvahall, though.\\n\\nSaphira \\npresented an image of Garrow hanging under her while she flew.\\nCan you lift \\nboth of us?\\n\\nI must. \\nEragon dug \\nthrough the rubble until he found a board and leather thongs. He had Saphira pierce \\na hole with a claw at each of the board’s corners, then he looped a piece of \\nleather through each hole and tied them to her forelegs. After checking to make \\nsure the knots were secure, he rolled Garrow onto the board and lashed him \\ndown. As he did, a scrap of black cloth fell from his uncle’s hand. It matched \\nthe strangers’ clothing. He angrily stuffed it in a pocket, mounted Saphira, \\nand closed his eyes as his body settled into a steady throb of pain.Now!\\nShe leapt up, \\nhind legs digging into the ground. Her wings clawed at the air as she slowly \\nclimbed. Tendons strained and popped as she battled gravity. For a long, \\npainful second, nothing happened, but then she lunged forward powerfully and \\nthey rose higher. Once they were over the forest, Eragon told her,Follow the \\nroad. It’ll give you enough room if you have to land.\\nI might be seen. \\nIt doesn’t \\nmatter anymore!She \\nargued no further as she veered to the road and headed for Carvahall. Garrow \\nswung wildly underneath them; only the slender leather cords kept him from \\nfalling.\\nThe extra weight \\nslowed Saphira. Before long her head sagged, and there was froth at her mouth. \\nShe struggled to continue, yet they were almost a league from Carvahall when \\nshe locked her wings and sank toward the road.\\nHer hind feet \\ntouched with a shower of snow. Eragon tumbled off her, landing heavily on his \\nside to avoid hurting his legs. He struggled to his feet and worked to untie \\nthe leather from Saphira’s legs. Her thick panting filled the air.Find a \\nsafe place to rest, he said.I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, so \\nyou’re going to have to take care of yourself for a while.\\nI will wait,she said.\\nHe gritted his \\nteeth and began to drag Garrow down the road. The first few steps sent an \\nexplosion of agony through him. “I can’t do this!” he howled at the sky, then \\ntook a few more steps. His mouth locked into a snarl. He stared at the ground \\nbetween his feet as he forced himself to hold a steady pace. It was a fight \\nagainst his unruly body—a fight he refused to lose. The minutes crawled by at \\nan excruciating rate. Each yard he covered seemed many times that. With \\ndesperation he wondered if Carvahall still existed or if the strangers had \\nburnt it down, too. After a time, through a haze of pain, he heard shouting and \\nlooked up.\\nBrom was running \\ntoward him—eyes large, hair awry, and one side of his head caked with dried \\nblood. He waved his arms wildly before dropping his staff and grabbing Eragon’s \\nshoulders, saying something in a loud voice. Eragon blinked uncomprehendingly. \\nWithout warning, the ground rushed up to meet him. He tasted blood, then \\nblacked out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD EATHWATCH \\nDreams roiled in \\nEragon’s mind, breeding and living by their own laws.He watched as a group \\nof people on proud horses approached a lonely river. Many had silver hair and \\ncarried tall lances. A strange, fair ship waited for them, shining under a \\nbright moon. The figures slowly boarded the vessel; two of them, taller than \\nthe rest, walked arm in arm. Their faces were obscured by cowls, but he could \\ntell that one was a woman. They stood on the deck of the ship and faced the \\nshore. A man stood alone on the pebble beach, the only one who had not boarded \\nthe ship. He threw back his head and let out a long, aching cry. As it faded, \\nthe ship glided down the river, without a breeze or oars, out into the flat, \\nempty land. The vision clouded, but just before it disappeared, Eragon glimpsed \\ntwo dragons in the sky.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon was first \\naware of the creaking: back and forth, back and forth. The persistent sound \\nmade him open his eyes and stare at the underside of a thatched roof. A rough \\nblanket was draped over him, concealing his nakedness. Someone had bandaged his \\nlegs and tied a clean rag around his knuckles.\\nHe was in a \\nsingle-room hut. A mortar and pestle sat on a table with bowls and plants. Rows \\nof dried herbs hung from the walls and suffused the air with strong, earthy \\naromas. Flames writhed inside a fireplace, before which sat a rotund woman in a \\nwicker rocking chair—the town healer, Gertrude. Her head lolled, eyes closed. A \\npair of knitting needles and a ball of wool thread rested in her lap.\\nThough Eragon \\nfelt drained of willpower, he made himself sit up. That helped to clear his \\nmind. He sifted through his memories of the last two days. His first thought \\nwas of Garrow, and his second was of Saphira.I hope she’s in a safe place. \\nHe tried to contact her but could not. Wherever she was, it was far from \\nCarvahall.At least Brom got me to Carvahall. I wonder what happened to him? There \\nwas all that blood.\\nGertrude stirred \\nand opened her sparkling eyes. “Oh,” she said. “You’re awake. Good!” Her voice \\nwas rich and warm. “How do you feel?”\\n“Well enough. \\nWhere’s Garrow?”\\nGertrude dragged \\nthe chair close to the bed. “Over at Horst’s. There wasn’t enough room to keep \\nboth of you here. And let me tell you, it’s kept me on my toes, having to run \\nback and forth, checking to see if the two of you were all right.”\\nEragon swallowed \\nhis worries and asked, “How is he?”\\nThere was a long \\ndelay as she examined her hands. “Not good. He has a fever that refuses to \\nbreak, and his injuries aren’t healing.”\\n“I have to see \\nhim.” He tried to get up.\\n“Not until you \\neat,” she said sharply, pushing him down. “I didn’t spend all this time sitting \\nby your side so you can get back up and hurt yourself. Half the skin on your \\nlegs was torn off, and your fever broke only last night. Don’t worry yourself \\nabout Garrow. He’ll be fine. He’s a tough man.” Gertrude hung a kettle over the \\nfire, then began chopping parsnips for soup.\\n“How long have I \\nbeen here?”\\n“Two full days.”\\nTwo days!That meant his \\nlast meal had been four mornings ago! Just thinking about it made Eragon feel \\nweak.Saphira’s been on her own this entire time; I hope she’s all right.\\n“The whole town \\nwants to know what happened. They sent men down to your farm and found it \\ndestroyed.” Eragon nodded; he had expected that. “Your barn was burned down. . \\n. . Is that how Garrow was injured?”\\n“I . . . I don’t \\nknow,” said Eragon. “I wasn’t there when it happened.”\\n“Well, no \\nmatter. I’m sure it’ll all get untangled.” Gertrude resumed knitting while the \\nsoup cooked. “That’s quite a scar on your palm.”\\nHe reflexively \\nclenched his hand. “Yes.”\\n“How did you get \\nit?”\\nSeveral possible \\nanswers came to mind. He chose the simplest one. “I’ve had it ever since I can \\nremember. I never asked Garrow where it came from.”\\n“Mmm.” The \\nsilence remained unbroken until the soup reached a rolling boil. Gertrude \\npoured it in a bowl and handed it to Eragon with a spoon. He accepted it \\ngratefully and took a cautious sip. It was delicious.\\nWhen he \\nfinished, he asked, “Can I visit Garrow now?”\\nGertrude sighed. \\n“You’re a determined one, aren’t you? Well, if you really want to, I won’t stop \\nyou. Put on your clothes and we’ll go.”\\nShe turned her \\nback as he struggled into his pants, wincing as they dragged over the bandages, \\nand then slipped on his shirt. Gertrude helped him stand. His legs were weak, \\nbut they did not pain him like before.\\n“Take a few \\nsteps,” she commanded, then dryly observed, “At least you won’t have to crawl \\nthere.”\\nOutside, a \\nblustery wind blew smoke from the adjacent buildings into their faces. Storm \\nclouds hid the Spine and covered the valley while a curtain of snow advanced \\ntoward the village, obscuring the foothills. Eragon leaned heavily on Gertrude \\nas they made their way through Carvahall.\\nHorst had built \\nhis two-story house on a hill so he could enjoy a view of the mountains. He had \\nlavished all of his skill on it. The shale roof shadowed a railed balcony that \\nextended from a tall window on the second floor. Each water spout was a \\nsnarling gargoyle, and every window and door was framed by carvings of \\nserpents, harts, ravens, and knotted vines.\\nThe door was \\nopened by Elain, Horst’s wife, a small, willowy woman with refined features and \\nsilky blond hair pinned into a bun. Her dress was demure and neat, and her \\nmovements graceful. “Please, come in,” she said softly. They stepped over the \\nthreshold into a large well-lit room. A staircase with a polished balustrade curved \\ndown to the floor. The walls were the color of honey. Elain gave Eragon a sad \\nsmile, but addressed Gertrude. “I was just about to send for you. He isn’t \\ndoing well. You should see him right away.”\\n“Elain, you’ll \\nhave to help Eragon up the stairs,” Gertrude said, then hurried up them two at \\na time.\\n“It’s okay, I \\ncan do it myself.”\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Elain. He nodded, but she looked doubtful. “Well . . . as soon as you’re \\ndone come visit me in the kitchen. I have a fresh-baked pie you might enjoy.” \\nAs soon as she left, he sagged against the wall, welcoming the support. Then he \\nstarted up the stairs, one painful step at a time. When he reached the top, he \\nlooked down a long hallway dotted with doors. The last one was open slightly. \\nTaking a breath, he lurched toward it.\\nKatrina stood by \\na fireplace, boiling rags. She looked up, murmured a condolence, and then \\nreturned to her work. Gertrude stood beside her, grinding herbs for a poultice. \\nA bucket by her feet held snow melting into ice water.\\nGarrow lay on a \\nbed piled high with blankets. Sweat covered his brow, and his eyeballs \\nflickered blindly under their lids. The skin on his face was shrunken like a \\ncadaver’s. He was still, save for subtle tremors from his shallow breathing. \\nEragon touched his uncle’s forehead with a feeling of unreality. It burned \\nagainst his hand. He apprehensively lifted the edge of the blankets and saw \\nthat Garrow’s many wounds were bound with strips of cloth. Where the bandages \\nwere being changed, the burns were exposed to the air. They had not begun to \\nheal. Eragon looked at Gertrude with hopeless eyes. “Can’t you do anything \\nabout these?”\\nShe pressed a \\nrag into the bucket of ice water, then draped the cool cloth over Garrow’s \\nhead. “I’ve tried everything: salves, poultices, tinctures, but nothing works. \\nIf the wounds closed, he would have a better chance. Still, things may turn for \\nthe better. He’s hardy and strong.”\\nEragon moved to \\na corner and sank to the floor.This isn’t the way things are supposed to be! \\nSilence swallowed his thoughts. He stared blankly at the bed. After a while he \\nnoticed Katrina kneeling beside him. She put an arm around him. When he did not \\nrespond, she diffidently left.\\nSometime later \\nthe door opened and Horst came in. He talked to Gertrude in a low voice, then \\napproached Eragon. “Come on. You need to get out of here.” Before Eragon could \\nprotest, Horst dragged him to his feet and shepherded him out the door.\\n“I want to \\nstay,” he complained.\\n“You need a \\nbreak and fresh air. Don’t worry, you can go back soon enough,” consoled Horst.\\nEragon \\ngrudgingly let the smith help him downstairs into the kitchen. Heady smells \\nfrom half a dozen dishes—rich with spices and herbs—filled the air. Albriech \\nand Baldor were there, talking with their mother as she kneaded bread. The \\nbrothers fell silent as they saw Eragon, but he had heard enough to know that \\nthey were discussing Garrow.\\n“Here, sit \\ndown,” said Horst, offering a chair.\\nEragon sank into \\nit gratefully. “Thank you.” His hands were shaking slightly, so he clasped them \\nin his lap. A plate, piled high with food, was set before him.\\n“You don’t have \\nto eat,” said Elain, “but it’s there if you want.” She returned to her cooking \\nas he picked up a fork. He could barely swallow a few bites.\\n“How do you \\nfeel?” asked Horst.\\n“Terrible.”\\nThe smith waited \\na moment. “I know this isn’t the best time, but we need to know . . . what \\nhappened?”\\n“I don’t really \\nremember.”\\n“Eragon,” said \\nHorst, leaning forward, “I was one of the people who went out to your farm. \\nYour house didn’t just fall apart—something tore it to pieces. Surrounding it \\nwere tracks of a gigantic beast I’ve never seen nor heard of before. Others saw \\nthem too. Now, if there’s a Shade or a monster roaming around, we have to know. \\nYou’re the only one who can tell us.”\\nEragon knew he \\nhad to lie. “When I left Carvahall . . . ,” he counted up the time, “four days \\nago, there were . . . strangers in town asking about a stone like the one I \\nfound.” He gestured at Horst. “You talked to me about them, and because of \\nthat, I hurried home.” All eyes were upon him. He licked his lips. “Nothing . . \\n. nothing happened that night. The next morning I finished my chores and went \\nwalking in the forest. Before long I heard an explosion and saw smoke above the \\ntrees. I rushed back as fast as I could, but whoever did it was already gone. I \\ndug through the wreckage and . . . found Garrow.”\\n“So then you put \\nhim on the plank and dragged him back?” asked Albriech.\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, “but before I left, I looked at the path to the road. There were two \\npairs of tracks on it, both of them men’s.” He dug in his pocket and pulled out \\nthe scrap of black fabric. “This was clenched in Garrow’s hand. I think it \\nmatches what those strangers were wearing.” He set it on the table.\\n“It does,” said \\nHorst. He looked both thoughtful and angry. “And what of your legs? How were \\nthey injured?”\\n“I’m not sure,” \\nsaid Eragon, shaking his head. “I think it happened when I dug Garrow out, but \\nI don’t know. It wasn’t until the blood started dripping down my legs that I \\nnoticed it.”\\n“That’s \\nhorrible!” exclaimed Elain.\\n“We should \\npursue those men,” stated Albriech hotly. “They can’t get away with this! With \\na pair of horses we could catch them tomorrow and bring them back here.”\\n“Put that \\nfoolishness out of your head,” said Horst. “They could probably pick you up \\nlike a baby and throw you in a tree. Remember what happened to the house? We \\ndon’t want to get in the way of those people. Besides, they have what they want \\nnow.” He looked at Eragon. “They did take the stone, didn’t they?”\\n“It wasn’t in \\nthe house.”\\n“Then there’s no \\nreason for them to return now that they have it.” He gave Eragon a piercing \\nlook. “You didn’t mention anything about those strange tracks. Do you know \\nwhere they came from?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “I didn’t see them.”\\nBaldor abruptly \\nspoke. “I don’t like this. Too much of this rings of wizardry. Who are those \\nmen? Are they Shades? Why did they want the stone, and how could they have \\ndestroyed the house except with dark powers? You may be right, Father, the \\nstone might be all they wanted, but I think we will see them again.”\\nSilence followed \\nhis words.\\nSomething had \\nbeen overlooked, though Eragon was not sure what. Then it struck him. With a \\nsinking heart, he voiced his suspicion. “Roran doesn’t know, does he?”How \\ncould I have forgotten him?\\nHorst shook his \\nhead. “He and Dempton left a little while after you. Unless they ran into some \\ndifficulty on the road, they’ve been in Therinsford for a couple of days now. \\nWe were going to send a message, but the weather was too cold yesterday and the \\nday before.”\\n“Baldor and I \\nwere about to leave when you woke up,” offered Albriech.\\nHorst ran a hand \\nthrough his beard. “Go on, both of you. I’ll help you saddle the horses.”\\nBaldor turned to \\nEragon. “I’ll break it to him gently,” he promised, then followed Horst and \\nAlbriech out of the kitchen.\\nEragon remained \\nat the table, his eyes focused on a knot in the wood. Every excruciating detail \\nwas clear to him: the twisting grain, an asymmetrical bump, three little ridges \\nwith a fleck of color. The knot was filled with endless detail; the closer he \\nlooked, the more he saw. He searched for answers in it, but if there were any, \\nthey eluded him.\\nA faint call \\nbroke through his pounding thoughts. It sounded like yelling from outside. He \\nignored it.Let someone else deal with it. Several minutes later he heard \\nit again, louder than before. Angrily, he blocked it out.Why can’t they be \\nquiet? Garrow’s resting. He glanced at Elain, but she did not seem to be \\nbothered by the noise.\\nERAGON!The roar was so \\nstrong he almost fell out of the chair. He peered around in alarm, but nothing \\nhad changed. He suddenly realized that the shouts had been inside his head.\\nSaphira?he asked \\nanxiously.\\nThere was a \\npause.Yes, stone ears.\\nRelief seeped \\ninto him.Where are you?\\nShe sent him an \\nimage of a small clump of trees.I tried to contact you many times, but you \\nwere beyond reach.\\nI was sick . . . \\nbut I’m better now. Why couldn’t I sense you earlier? \\nAfter two nights \\nof waiting, hunger bested me. I had to hunt. \\nDid you catch \\nanything?\\n\\nA young buck. He \\nwas wise enough to guard against the predators of land, but not those of sky. \\nWhen I first caught him in my jaws, he kicked vigorously and tried to escape. I \\nwas stronger, though, and when defeat became unavoidable, he gave up and died. \\nDoes Garrow also fight the inevitable? \\nI don’t know.He told her the \\nparticulars, then said,It’ll be a long time, if ever, before we can go home. \\nI won’t be able to see you for at least a couple of days. You might as well \\nmake yourself comfortable.\\nUnhappily, she \\nsaid,I will do as you say. But do not take too long.\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. He looked out a window and was surprised to see that the sun had \\nset. Feeling very tired, he limped to Elain, who was wrapping meat pies with \\noilcloth. “I’m going back to Gertrude’s house to sleep,” he said.\\nShe finished \\nwith the packages and asked, “Why don’t you stay with us? You’ll be closer to \\nyour uncle, and Gertrude can have her bed back.”\\n“Do you have \\nenough room?” he asked, wavering.\\n“Of course.” She \\nwiped her hands. “Come with me; I’ll get everything ready.” She escorted him \\nupstairs to an empty room. He sat on the edge of the bed. “Do you need anything \\nelse?” she asked. He shook his head. “In that case, I’ll be downstairs. Call me \\nif you need help.” He listened as she descended the stairs. Then he opened the \\ndoor and slipped down the hallway to Garrow’s room. Gertrude gave him a small \\nsmile over her darting knitting needles.\\n“How is he?” whispered \\nEragon.\\nHer voice rasped \\nwith fatigue. “He’s weak, but the fever’s gone down a little and some of the \\nburns look better. We’ll have to wait and see, but this could mean he’ll \\nrecover.”\\nThat lightened \\nEragon’s mood, and he returned to his room. The darkness seemed unfriendly as \\nhe huddled under the blankets. Eventually he fell asleep, healing the wounds \\nhis body and soul had suffered.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEMADNESS OFLIFE\\nIt was dark when \\nEragon jolted upright in bed, breathing hard. The room was chilly; goose bumps \\nformed on his arms and shoulders. It was a few hours before dawn—the time when \\nnothing moves and life waits for the first warm touches of sunlight.\\nHis heart \\npounded as a terrible premonition gripped him. It felt like a shroud lay over \\nthe world, and its darkest corner was over his room. He quietly got out of bed \\nand dressed. With apprehension he hurried down the hallway. Alarm shot through \\nhim when he saw the door to Garrow’s room open and people clustered inside.\\nGarrow lay \\npeacefully on the bed. He was dressed in clean clothes, his hair had been \\ncombed back, and his face was calm. He might have been sleeping if not for the \\nsilver amulet clasped around his neck and the sprig of dried hemlock on his \\nchest, the last gifts from the living to the dead.\\nKatrina stood \\nnext to the bed, face pale and eyes downcast. He heard her whisper, “I had \\nhoped to call himFather one day. . . .”\\nCall him Father,he thought \\nbitterly,a right even I don’t have. He felt like a ghost, drained of all \\nvitality. Everything was insubstantial except for Garrow’s face. Tears flooded \\nEragon’s cheeks. He stood there, shoulders shaking, but did not cry out. \\nMother, aunt, uncle—he had lost them all. The weight of his grief was crushing, \\na monstrous force that left him tottering. Someone led him back to his room, \\nuttering consolations.\\nHe fell on the \\nbed, wrapped his arms around his head, and sobbed convulsively. He felt Saphira \\ncontact him, but he pushed her aside and let himself be swept away by sorrow. \\nHe could not accept that Garrow was gone. If he did, what was left to believe \\nin? Only a merciless, uncaring world that snuffed lives like candles before a \\nwind. Frustrated and terrified, he turned his tear-dampened face toward the \\nheavens and shouted, “What god would do this? Show yourself!” He heard people \\nrunning to his room, but no answer came from above. “He didn’t deserve this!”\\nComforting hands \\ntouched him, and he was aware of Elain sitting next to him. She held him as he \\ncried, and eventually, exhausted, he slipped unwillingly into sleep.\\nAR IDER’SBLADE\\nAnguish enveloped \\nEragon as he awoke. Though he kept his eyes closed, they could not stop a fresh \\nflow of tears. He searched for some idea or hope to help him keep his sanity.I \\ncan’t live with this, he moaned.\\nThen don’t.Saphira’s words \\nreverberated in his head.\\nHow? Garrow is \\ngone forever! And in time, I must meet the same fate. Love, family, \\naccomplishments—they are all torn away, leaving nothing. What is the worth of \\nanything we do?\\n\\nThe worth is in \\nthe act. Your worth halts when you surrender the will to change and experience \\nlife. But options are before you; choose one and dedicate yourself to it. The \\ndeeds will give you new hope and purpose. \\nBut what can I \\ndo?\\n\\nThe only true \\nguide is your heart. Nothing less than its supreme desire can help you. \\nShe left him to \\nponder her statements. Eragon examined his emotions. It surprised him that, \\nmore than grief, he found a searing anger.What do you want me to do . . . \\npursue the strangers?\\nYes. \\nHer frank answer \\nconfused him. He took a deep, trembling breath.Why?\\nRemember what \\nyou said in the Spine? How you reminded me of my duty as dragon, and I returned \\nwith you despite the urging of my instinct? So, too, must you control yourself. \\nI thought long and deep the past few days, and I realized what it means to be \\ndragon and Rider: It is our destiny to attempt the impossible, to accomplish \\ngreat deeds regardless of fear. It is our responsibility to the future. \\nI don’t care \\nwhat you say; those aren’t reasons to leave!cried Eragon.\\nThen here are \\nothers. My tracks have been seen, and people are alert to my presence. \\nEventually I will be exposed. Besides, there is nothing here for you. No farm, \\nno family, and—\\n\\nRoran’s not \\ndead!he \\nsaid vehemently.\\nBut if you stay, \\nyou’ll have to explain what really happened. He has a right to know how and why \\nhis father died. What might he do once he knows of me? \\nSaphira’s \\narguments whirled around in Eragon’s head, but he shrank from the idea of \\nforsaking Palancar Valley; it was his home. Yet the thought of enacting \\nvengeance on the strangers was fiercely comforting.Am I strong enough for \\nthis?\\nYou have me. \\nDoubt besieged \\nhim. It would be such a wild, desperate thing to do. Contempt for his \\nindecision rose, and a harsh smile danced on his lips. Saphira was right. \\nNothing mattered anymore except the act itself.The doing is the thing. \\nAnd what would give him more satisfaction than hunting down the strangers? A \\nterrible energy and strength began to grow in him. It grabbed his emotions and \\nforged them into a solid bar of anger with one word stamped on it: revenge. His \\nhead pounded as he said with conviction,I will do it.\\nHe severed the \\ncontact with Saphira and rolled out of bed, his body tense like a coiled \\nspring. It was still early morning; he had only slept a few hours.Nothing is \\nmore dangerous than an enemy with nothing to lose, he thought.Which is \\nwhat I have become.\\nYesterday he had \\nhad difficulty walking upright, but now he moved confidently, held in place by \\nhis iron will. The pain his body sent him was defied and ignored.\\nAs he crept out \\nof the house, he heard the murmur of two people talking. Curious, he stopped \\nand listened. Elain was saying in her gentle voice, “. . . place to stay. We \\nhave room.” Horst answered inaudibly in his bass rumble. “Yes, the poor boy,” \\nreplied Elain.\\nThis time Eragon \\ncould hear Horst’s response. “Maybe . . .” There was a long pause. “I’ve been \\nthinking about what Eragon said, and I’m not sure he told us everything.”\\n“What do you \\nmean?” asked Elain. There was concern in her voice.\\n“When we started \\nfor their farm, the road was scraped smooth by the board he dragged Garrow on. \\nThen we reached a place where the snow was all trampled and churned up. His \\nfootprints and signs of the board stopped there, but we also saw the same giant \\ntracks from the farm. And what about his legs? I can’t believe he didn’t notice \\nlosing that much skin. I didn’t want to push him for answers earlier, but now I \\nthink I will.”\\n“Maybe what he \\nsaw scared him so much that he doesn’t want to talk about it,” suggested Elain. \\n“You saw how distraught he was.”\\n“That still \\ndoesn’t explain how he managed to get Garrow nearly all the way here without \\nleaving any tracks.”\\nSaphira was \\nright,thought \\nEragon.It’s time to leave.Too many questions from too many people.Sooner or \\nlater they’ll find the answers. He continued through the house, tensing \\nwhenever the floor creaked.\\nThe streets were \\nclear; few people were up at this time of day. He stopped for a minute and \\nforced himself to focus.I don’t need a horse. Saphira will be my steed, but \\nshe needs a saddle. She can hunt for both of us, so I don’t have to worry about \\nfood—though I should get some anyway. Whatever else I need I can find buried in \\nour house.\\nHe went to \\nGedric’s tanning vats on the outskirts of Carvahall. The vile smell made him \\ncringe, but he kept moving, heading for a shack set into the side of a hill \\nwhere the cured hides were stored. He cut down three large ox hides from the \\nrows of skins hanging from the ceiling. The thievery made him feel guilty, but \\nhe reasoned,It’s not really stealing. I’ll pay Gedric back someday, along \\nwith Horst. He rolled up the thick leather and took it to a stand of trees \\naway from the village. He wedged the hides between the branches of a tree, then \\nreturned to Carvahall.\\nNow for food.He went to the \\ntavern, intending to get it there, but then smiled tightly and reversed \\ndirection. If he was going to steal, it might as well be from Sloan. He sneaked \\nup to the butcher’s house. The front door was barred whenever Sloan was not \\nthere, but the side door was secured with only a thin chain, which he broke \\neasily. The rooms inside were dark. He fumbled blindly until his hands came \\nupon hard piles of meat wrapped in cloth. He stuffed as many of them as he \\ncould under his shirt, then hurried back to the street and furtively closed the \\ndoor.\\nA woman shouted \\nhis name nearby. He clasped the bottom of his shirt to keep the meat from \\nfalling out and ducked behind a corner. He shivered as Horst walked between two \\nhouses not ten feet away.\\nEragon ran as \\nsoon as Horst was out of sight. His legs burned as he pounded down an alley and \\nback to the trees. He slipped between the tree trunks, then turned to see if he \\nwas being pursued. No one was there. Relieved, he let out his breath and \\nreached into the tree for the leather. It was gone.\\n“Going \\nsomewhere?”\\nEragon whirled \\naround. Brom scowled angrily at him, an ugly wound on the side of his head. A \\nshort sword hung at his belt in a brown sheath. The hides were in his hands.\\nEragon’s eyes \\nnarrowed in irritation. How had the old man managed to sneak up on him? \\nEverything had been so quiet, he would have sworn that no one was around. “Give \\nthem back,” he snapped.\\n“Why? So you can \\nrun off before Garrow is even buried?” The accusation was sharp.\\n“It’s none of \\nyour business!” he barked, temper flashing. “Why did you follow me?”\\n“I didn’t,” \\ngrunted Brom. “I’ve been waiting for you here. Now where are you going?”\\n“Nowhere.” \\nEragon lunged for the skins and grabbed them from Brom’s hands. Brom did \\nnothing to stop him.\\n“I hope you have \\nenough meat to feed your dragon.”\\nEragon froze. \\n“What are you talking about?”\\nBrom crossed his \\narms. “Don’t fool with me. I know where that mark on your hand, the gedwëy \\nignasia, theshining palm, comes from: you have touched a dragon hatchling. \\nI know why you came to me with those questions, and I know that once more the \\nRiders live.”\\nEragon dropped \\nthe leather and meat.It’s finally happened . . . I have to get away! I can’t \\nrun faster than him with my injured legs, but if . . . Saphira! he called.\\nFor a few \\nagonizing seconds she did not answer, but then,Yes.\\nWe’ve been \\ndiscovered! I need you!He sent her a picture of where he was, and she took \\noff immediately. Now he just had to stall Brom. “How did you find out?” he \\nasked in a hollow voice.\\nBrom stared into \\nthe distance and moved his lips soundlessly as if he were talking to someone \\nelse. Then he said, “There were clues and hints everywhere; I had only to pay \\nattention. Anyone with the right knowledge could have done the same. Tell me, \\nhow is your dragon?”\\n“She,” said \\nEragon, “is fine. We weren’t at the farm when the strangers came.”\\n“Ah, your legs. \\nYou were flying?”\\nHow did Brom \\nfigure that out? What if the strangers coerced him into doing this? Maybe they \\nwant him to discover where I’m going so they can ambush us. And where is \\nSaphira?He \\nreached out with his mind and found her circling far overhead.Come!\\nNo, I will watch \\nfor a time.\\n\\nWhy! \\nBecause of the \\nslaughter at Dorú Areaba. \\nWhat? \\nBrom leaned \\nagainst a tree with a slight smile. “I have talked with her, and she has agreed \\nto stay above us until we settle our differences. As you can see, you really \\ndon’t have any choice but to answer my questions. Now tell me, where are you \\ngoing?”\\nBewildered, \\nEragon put a hand to his temple.How could Brom speak to Saphira? The \\nback of his head throbbed and ideas whirled through his mind, but he kept \\nreaching the same conclusion: he had to tell the old man something. He said, “I \\nwas going to find a safe place to stay while I heal.”\\n“And after \\nthat?”\\nThe question \\ncould not be ignored. The throbbing in his head grew worse. It was impossible \\nto think; nothing seemed clear anymore. All he wanted to do was tell someone \\nabout the events of the past few months. It tore at him that his secret had \\ncaused Garrow’s death. He gave up and said tremulously, “I was going to hunt \\ndown the strangers and kill them.”\\n“A mighty task \\nfor one so young,” Brom said in a normal tone, as if Eragon had proposed the \\nmost obvious and suitable thing to do. “Certainly a worthy endeavor and one you \\nare fit to carry out, yet it strikes me that help would not be unwelcome.” He \\nreached behind a bush and pulled out a large pack. His tone became gruff. \\n“Anyway, I’m not going to stay behind while some stripling gets to run around \\nwith a dragon.”\\nIs he really \\noffering help, or is it a trap?Eragon was afraid of what his mysterious \\nenemies could do.But Brom convinced Saphira to trust him, and they’ve talked \\nthrough the mind touch.If she isn’t worried . . . He decided to put his \\nsuspicions aside for the present. “I don’t need help,” said Eragon, then \\ngrudgingly added, “but you can come.”\\n“Then we had \\nbest be going,” said Brom. His face blanked for a moment. “I think you’ll find \\nthat your dragon will listen to you again.”\\nSaphira?asked Eragon.\\nYes. \\nHe resisted the \\nurge to question her.Will you meet us at the farm?\\nYes. So you \\nreached an agreement?\\n\\nI guess so.She broke \\ncontact and soared away. He glanced at Carvahall and saw people running from \\nhouse to house. “I think they’re looking for me.”\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “Probably. Shall we go?”\\nEragon \\nhesitated. “I’d like to leave a message for Roran. It doesn’t seem right to run \\noff without telling him why.”\\n“It’s been taken \\ncare of,” assured Brom. “I left a letter for him with Gertrude, explaining a \\nfew things. I also cautioned him to be on guard for certain dangers. Is that \\nsatisfactory?”\\nEragon nodded. \\nHe wrapped the leather around the meat and started off. They were careful to \\nstay out of sight until they reached the road, then quickened their pace, eager \\nto distance themselves from Carvahall. Eragon plowed ahead determinedly, his \\nlegs burning. The mindless rhythm of walking freed his mind to think.Once we \\nget home, I won’t travel any farther with Brom until I get some answers, he \\ntold himself firmly. I hope that he can tell me more about the Riders and \\nwhom I’m fighting.\\nAs the wreckage \\nof the farm came into view, Brom’s eyebrows beetled with anger. Eragon was \\ndismayed to see how swiftly nature was reclaiming the farm. Snow and dirt were \\nalready piled inside the house, concealing the violence of the strangers’ \\nattack. All that remained of the barn was a rapidly eroding rectangle of soot.\\nBrom’s head \\nsnapped up as the sound of Saphira’s wings drifted over the trees. She dived \\npast them from behind, almost brushing their heads. They staggered as a wall of \\nair buffeted them. Saphira’s scales glittered as she wheeled over the farm and \\nlanded gracefully.\\nBrom stepped \\nforward with an expression both solemn and joyous. His eyes were shining, and a \\ntear shone on his cheek before it disappeared into his beard. He stood there \\nfor a long while, breathing heavily as he watched Saphira, and she him. Eragon \\nheard him muttering and edged closer to listen.\\n“So . . . it \\nstarts again. But how and where will it end? My sight is veiled; I cannot tell \\nif this be tragedy or farce, for the elements of both are here. . . . However \\nit may be, my station is unchanged, and I . . .”\\nWhatever else he \\nmight have said faded away as Saphira proudly approached them. Eragon passed \\nBrom, pretended he had heard nothing, and greeted her. There was something \\ndifferent between them now, as if they knew each other even more intimately, yet \\nwere still strangers. He rubbed her neck, and his palm tingled as their minds \\ntouched. A strong curiosity came from her.\\nI’ve seen no \\nhumans except you and Garrow, and he was badly injured,she said.\\nYou’ve viewed \\npeople through my eyes.\\nIt’s not the \\nsame.She \\ncame closer and turned her long head so that she could inspect Brom with one \\nlarge blue eye.You really are queer creatures, she said critically, and \\ncontinued to stare at him. Brom held still as she sniffed the air, and then he \\nextended a hand to her. Saphira slowly bowed her head and allowed him to touch \\nher on the brow. With a snort, she jerked back and retreated behind Eragon. Her \\ntail flicked over the ground.\\nWhat is it?he asked. She \\ndid not answer.\\nBrom turned to \\nhim and asked in an undertone, “What’s her name?”\\n“Saphira.” A \\npeculiar expression crossed Brom’s face. He ground the butt of his staff into \\nthe earth with such force his knuckles turned white. “Of all the names you gave \\nme, it was the only one she liked. I think it fits,” Eragon added quickly.\\n“Fit it does,” \\nsaid Brom. There was something in his voice Eragon could not identify. Was it \\nloss, wonder, fear, envy? He was not sure; it could have been none of them or \\nall. Brom raised his voice and said, “Greetings, Saphira. I am honored to meet \\nyou.” He twisted his hand in a strange gesture and bowed.\\nI like him,said Saphira \\nquietly.\\nOf course you \\ndo; everyone enjoys flattery.Eragon touched her on the shoulder and \\nwent to the ruined house. Saphira trailed behind with Brom. The old man looked \\nvibrant and alive.\\nEragon climbed \\ninto the house and crawled under a door into what was left of his room. He \\nbarely recognized it under the piles of shattered wood. Guided by memory, he \\nsearched where the inside wall had been and found his empty pack. Part of the \\nframe was broken, but the damage could be easily repaired. He kept rummaging \\nand eventually uncovered the end of his bow, which was still in its buckskin \\ntube.\\nThough the \\nleather was scratched and scuffed, he was pleased to see that the oiled wood \\nwas unharmed.Finally, some luck. He strung the bow and pulled on the \\nsinew experimentally. It bent smoothly, without any snaps or creaks. Satisfied, \\nhe hunted for his quiver, which he found buried nearby. Many of the arrows were \\nbroken.\\nHe unstrung the \\nbow and handed it and the quiver to Brom, who said, “It takes a strong arm to \\npull that.” Eragon took the compliment silently. He picked through the rest of \\nthe house for other useful items and dumped the collection next to Brom. It was \\na meager pile. “What now?” asked Brom. His eyes were sharp and inquisitive. \\nEragon looked away.\\n“We find a place \\nto hide.”\\n“Do you have \\nsomewhere in mind?”\\n“Yes.” He \\nwrapped all the supplies, except for his bow, into a tight bundle and tied it \\nshut. Hefting it onto his back, he said, “This way,” and headed into the \\nforest.Saphira, follow us in the air. Your footprints are too easily found \\nand tracked.\\nVery well.She took off \\nbehind them.\\nTheir \\ndestination was nearby, but Eragon took a circuitous route in an effort to \\nbaffle any pursuers. It was well over an hour before he finally stopped in a \\nwell-concealed bramble.\\nThe irregular \\nclearing in the center was just large enough for a fire, two people, and a \\ndragon. Red squirrels scampered into the trees, chattering in protest at their \\nintrusion. Brom extricated himself from a vine and looked around with interest. \\n“Does anyone else know of this?” he asked.\\n“No. I found it \\nwhen we first moved here. It took me a week to dig into the center, and another \\nweek to clear out all the deadwood.” Saphira landed beside them and folded her \\nwings, careful to avoid the thorns. She curled up, snapping twigs with her hard \\nscales, and rested her head on the ground. Her unreadable eyes followed them \\nclosely.\\nBrom leaned \\nagainst his staff and fixed his gaze on her. His scrutiny made Eragon nervous.\\nEragon watched \\nthem until hunger forced him to action. He built a fire, filled a pot with \\nsnow, and then set it over the flames to melt. When the water was hot, he tore \\noff chunks of meat and dropped them into the pot with a lump of salt.Not \\nmuch of a meal, he thought grimly,but it’ll do. I’ll probably be eating \\nthis for some time to come, so I might as well get used to it.\\nThe stew \\nsimmered quietly, spreading a rich aroma through the clearing. The tip of \\nSaphira’s tongue snaked out and tasted the air. When the meat was tender, Brom \\ncame over and Eragon served the food. They ate silently, avoiding each other’s \\neyes. Afterward, Brom pulled out his pipe and lit it leisurely.\\n“Why do you want \\nto travel with me?” asked Eragon.\\nA cloud of smoke \\nleft Brom’s lips and spiraled up through the trees until it disappeared. “I \\nhave a vested interest in keeping you alive,” he said.\\n“What do you \\nmean?” demanded Eragon.\\n“To put it \\nbluntly, I’m a storyteller and I happen to think that you will make a fine \\nstory. You’re the first Rider to exist outside of the king’s control for over a \\nhundred years. What will happen? Will you perish as a martyr? Will you join the \\nVarden? Or will you kill King Galbatorix? All fascinating questions. And I will \\nbe there to see every bit of it, no matter what I have to do.”\\nA knot formed in \\nEragon’s stomach. He could not see himself doing any of those things, least of \\nall becoming a martyr.I want my vengeance, but for the rest . . . I have no ambition. \\n“That may be, but tell me, how can you talk with Saphira?”\\nBrom took his \\ntime putting more tobacco in his pipe. Once it was relit and firmly in his \\nmouth, he said, “Very well, if it’s answers you want, it’s answers you’ll get, \\nbut they may not be to your liking.” He got up, brought his pack over to the \\nfire, and pulled out a long object wrapped in cloth. It was about five feet \\nlong and, from the way he handled it, rather heavy.\\nHe peeled away \\nthe cloth, strip by strip, like a mummy being unswathed. Eragon gazed, \\ntransfixed, as a sword was revealed. The gold pommel was teardrop shaped with \\nthe sides cut away to reveal a ruby the size of a small egg. The hilt was \\nwrapped in silver wire, burnished until it gleamed like starlight. The sheath \\nwas wine red and smooth as glass, adorned solely by a strange black symbol \\netched into it. Next to the sword was a leather belt with a heavy buckle. The \\nlast strip fell away, and Brom passed the weapon to Eragon.\\nThe handle fit \\nEragon’s hand as if it had been made for him. He slowly drew the sword; it slid \\nsoundlessly from the sheath. The flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in \\nthe firelight. The keen edges curved gracefully to a sharp point. A duplicate \\nof the black symbol was inscribed on the metal. The balance of the sword was \\nperfect; it felt like an extension of his arm, unlike the rude farm tools he \\nwas used to. An air of power lay over it, as if an unstoppable force resided in \\nits core. It had been created for the violent convulsions of battle, to end men’s \\nlives, yet it held a terrible beauty.\\n“This was once a \\nRider’s blade,” said Brom gravely. “When a Rider finished his training, the \\nelves would present him with a sword. Their methods of forging have always \\nremained secret. However, their swords are eternally sharp and will never \\nstain. The custom was to have the blade’s color match that of the Rider’s \\ndragon, but I think we can make an exception in this case. This sword is named \\nZar’roc. I don’t know what it means, probably something personal to the Rider \\nwho owned it.” He watched Eragon swing the sword.\\n“Where did you \\nget it?” asked Eragon. He reluctantly slipped the blade back into the sheath \\nand attempted to hand the sword back, but Brom made no move to take it.\\n“It doesn’t \\nmatter,” said Brom. “I will only say that it took me a series of nasty and \\ndangerous adventures to attain it. Consider it yours. You have more of a claim \\nto it than I do, and before all is done, I think you will need it.”\\nThe offer caught \\nEragon off guard. “It is a princely gift, thank you.” Unsure of what else to \\nsay, he slid his hand down the sheath. “What is this symbol?” he asked.\\n“That was the \\nRider’s personal crest.” Eragon tried to interrupt, but Brom glared at him \\nuntil he was quiet. “Now, if you must know, anyone can learn how to speak to a \\ndragon if they have the proper training. And,” he raised a finger for emphasis, \\n“it doesn’t mean anything if they can. I know more about the dragons and their \\nabilities than almost anyone else alive. On your own it might take years to \\nlearn what I can teach you. I’m offering my knowledge as a shortcut. As for how \\nI know so much, I will keepthat to myself.”\\nSaphira pulled \\nherself up as he finished speaking and prowled over to Eragon. He pulled out \\nthe blade and showed her the sword.It has power, she said, touching the \\npoint with her nose. The metal’s iridescent color rippled like water as it met \\nher scales. She lifted her head with a satisfied snort, and the sword resumed \\nits normal appearance. Eragon sheathed it, troubled.\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “That’s the sort of thing I’m talking about. Dragons will constantly \\namaze you. Things . . . happen around them, mysterious things that are \\nimpossible anywhere else. Even though the Riders worked with dragons for \\ncenturies, they never completely understood their abilities. Some say that even \\nthe dragons don’t know the full extent of their own powers. They are linked \\nwith this land in a way that lets them overcome great obstacles. What Saphira \\njust did illustrates my earlier point: there is much you don’t know.”\\nThere was a long \\npause. “That may be,” said Eragon, “but I can learn. And the strangers are the \\nmost important thing I need to know about right now. Do you have any idea who \\nthey are?”\\nBrom took a deep \\nbreath. “They are called the Ra’zac. No one knows if that’s the name of their \\nrace or what they have chosen to call themselves. Either way, if they have \\nindividual names, they keep them hidden. The Ra’zac were never seen before \\nGalbatorix came to power. He must have found them during his travels and \\nenlisted them in his service. Little or nothing is known about them. However, I \\ncan tell you this: they aren’t human. When I glimpsed one’s head, it appeared \\nto have something resembling a beak and black eyes as large as my fist—though \\nhow they manage our speech is a mystery to me. Doubtless the rest of their \\nbodies are just as twisted. That is why they cover themselves with cloaks at \\nall times, regardless of the weather.\\n“As for their \\npowers, they are stronger than any man and can jump incredible heights, but \\nthey cannot use magic. Be thankful for that, because if they could, you would \\nalready be in their grasp. I also know they have a strong aversion to sunlight, \\nthough it won’t stop them if they’re determined. Don’t make the mistake of \\nunderestimating a Ra’zac, for they are cunning and full of guile.”\\n“How many of \\nthem are there?” asked Eragon, wondering how Brom could possibly know so much.\\n“As far as I \\nknow, only the two you saw. There might be more, but I’ve never heard of them. \\nPerhaps they’re the last of a dying race. You see, they are the king’s personal \\ndragon hunters. Whenever rumors reach Galbatorix of a dragon in the land, he \\nsends the Ra’zac to investigate. A trail of death often follows them.” Brom \\nblew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles. \\nEragon ignored the rings until he noticed that they were changing color and \\ndarting around. Brom winked slyly.\\nEragon was sure \\nthat no one had seen Saphira, so how could Galbatorix have heard about her? \\nWhen he voiced his objections, Brom said, “You’re right, it seems unlikely that \\nanyone from Carvahall could have informed the king. Why don’t you tell me where \\nyou got the egg and how you raised Saphira—that might clarify the issue.”\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then recounted all the events since he had found the egg in the \\nSpine. It felt wonderful to finally confide in someone. Brom asked a few \\nquestions, but most of the time he listened intently. The sun was about to set \\nwhen Eragon finished his tale. Both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a \\nsoft pink. Eragon eventually broke the silence. “I just wish I knew where she \\ncame from. And Saphira doesn’t remember.”\\nBrom cocked his \\nhead. “I don’t know. . . . You’ve made many things clear to me. I am sure that \\nno one besides us has seen Saphira. The Ra’zac must have had a source of \\ninformation outside of this valley, one who is probably dead by now. . . . You \\nhave had a hard time and done much. I’m impressed.”\\nEragon stared \\nblankly into the distance, then asked, “What happened to your head? It looks \\nlike you were hit with a rock.”\\n“No, but that’s \\na good guess.” He took a deep pull on the pipe. “I was sneaking around the \\nRa’zac’s camp after dark, trying to learn what I could, when they surprised me \\nin the shadows. It was a good trap, but they underestimated me, and I managed \\nto drive them away. Not, however,” he said wryly, “without this token of my \\nstupidity. Stunned, I fell to the ground and didn’t regain consciousness until \\nthe next day. By then they had already arrived at your farm. It was too late to \\nstop them, but I set out after them anyway. That’s when we met on the road.”\\nWho is he to \\nthink that he could take on the Ra’zac alone? They ambushed him in the dark, \\nand he was only stunned?Unsettled, Eragon asked hotly, “When you saw the \\nmark, the gedwëy ignasia, on my palm, why didn’t you tell me who the Ra’zac \\nwere? I would have warned Garrow instead of going to Saphira first, and the \\nthree of us could have fled.”\\nBrom sighed. “I \\nwas unsure of what to do at the time. I thought I could keep the Ra’zac away \\nfrom you and, once they had left, confront you about Saphira. But they \\noutsmarted me. It’s a mistake that I deeply regret, and one that has cost you \\ndearly.”\\n“Who are you?” \\ndemanded Eragon, suddenly bitter. “How come a mere village storyteller happens \\nto have a Rider’s sword? How do you know about the Ra’zac?”\\nBrom tapped his \\npipe. “I thought I made it clear I wasn’t going to talk about that.”\\n“My uncle is \\ndead because of this.Dead! ” exclaimed Eragon, slashing a hand through \\nthe air. “I’ve trusted you this far because Saphira respects you, but no more! \\nYou’re not the person I’ve known in Carvahall for all of these years. Explain \\nyourself!”\\nFor a long time \\nBrom stared at the smoke swirling between them, deep lines creasing his \\nforehead. When he stirred, it was only to take another puff. Finally he said, \\n“You’ve probably never thought about it, but most of my life has been spent \\noutside of Palancar Valley. It was only in Carvahall that I took up the mantle \\nof storyteller. I have played many roles to different people—I’ve a complicated \\npast. It was partly through a desire to escape it that I came here. So no, I’m \\nnot the man you think I am.”\\n“Ha!” snorted \\nEragon. “Then who are you?”\\nBrom smiled \\ngently. “I am one who is here to help you. Do not scorn those words—they are \\nthe truest I’ve ever spoken. But I’m not going to answer your questions. At \\nthis point you don’t need to hear my history, nor have you yet earned that \\nright. Yes, I have knowledge Brom the storyteller wouldn’t, but I’m more than \\nhe. You’ll have to learn to live with that fact and the fact that I don’t hand \\nout descriptions of my life to anyone who asks!”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim sullenly. “I’m going to sleep,” he said, leaving the fire.\\nBrom did not \\nseem surprised, but there was sorrow in his eyes. He spread his bedroll next to \\nthe fire as Eragon lay beside Saphira. An icy silence fell over the camp.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nS ADDLEMAKING \\nWhen Eragon’s \\neyes opened, the memory of Garrow’s death crashed down on him. He pulled the \\nblankets over his head and cried quietly under their warm darkness. It felt \\ngood just to lie there . . . to hide from the world outside. Eventually the \\ntears stopped. He cursed Brom. Then he reluctantly wiped his cheeks and got up.\\nBrom was making \\nbreakfast. “Good morning,” he said. Eragon grunted in reply. He jammed his cold \\nfingers in his armpits and crouched by the fire until the food was ready. They \\nate quickly, trying to consume the food before it lost its warmth. When he finished, \\nEragon washed his bowl with snow, then spread the stolen leather on the ground.\\n“What are you \\ngoing to do with that?” asked Brom. “We can’t carry it with us.”\\n“I’m going to \\nmake a saddle for Saphira.”\\n“Mmm,” said \\nBrom, moving forward. “Well, dragons used to have two kinds of saddles. The \\nfirst was hard and molded like a horse’s saddle. But those take time and tools \\nto make, neither of which we have. The other was thin and lightly padded, \\nnothing more than an extra layer between the Rider and dragon. Those saddles \\nwere used whenever speed and flexibility were important, though they weren’t \\nnearly as comfortable as the molded ones.”\\n“Do you know \\nwhat they looked like?” asked Eragon.\\n“Better, I can \\nmake one.”\\n“Then please \\ndo,” said Eragon, standing aside.\\n“Very well, but \\npay attention. Someday you may have to do this for yourself.” With Saphira’s \\npermission, Brom measured her neck and chest. Then he cut five bands out of the \\nleather and outlined a dozen or so shapes on the hides. Once the pieces had \\nbeen sliced out, he cut what remained of the hides into long cords.\\nBrom used the \\ncords to sew everything together, but for each stitch, two holes had to be \\nbored through the leather. Eragon helped with that. Intricate knots were rigged \\nin place of buckles, and every strap was made extra long so the saddle would \\nstill fit Saphira in the coming months.\\nThe main part of \\nthe saddle was assembled from three identical sections sewn together with \\npadding between them. Attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit \\nsnugly around one of Saphira’s neck spikes, while wide bands sewn on either \\nside would wrap around her belly and tie underneath. Taking the place of \\nstirrups were a series of loops running down both bands. Tightened, they would \\nhold Eragon’s legs in place. A long strap was constructed to pass between \\nSaphira’s front legs, split in two, and then come up behind her front legs to \\nrejoin with the saddle.\\nWhile Brom \\nworked, Eragon repaired his pack and organized their supplies. The day was \\nspent by the time their tasks were completed. Weary from his labor, Brom put \\nthe saddle on Saphira and checked to see that the straps fit. He made a few \\nsmall adjustments, then took it off, satisfied.\\n“You did a good \\njob,” Eragon acknowledged grudgingly.\\nBrom inclined \\nhis head. “One tries his best. It should serve you well; the leather’s sturdy \\nenough.”\\nAren’t you going \\nto try it out?asked \\nSaphira.\\nMaybe tomorrow,said Eragon, \\nstoring the saddle with his blankets.It’s too late now. In truth he was \\nnot eager to fly again—not after the disastrous outcome of his last attempt.\\nDinner was made \\nquickly. It tasted good even though it was simple. While they ate, Brom looked \\nover the fire at Eragon and asked, “Will we leave tomorrow?”\\n“There isn’t any \\nreason to stay.”\\n“I suppose not. \\n. . .” He shifted. “Eragon, I must apologize about how events have turned out. \\nI never wished for this to happen. Your family did not deserve such a tragedy. \\nIf there were anything I could do to reverse it, I would. This is a terrible \\nsituation for all of us.” Eragon sat in silence, avoiding Brom’s gaze, then \\nBrom said, “We’re going to need horses.”\\n“Maybe you do, \\nbut I have Saphira.”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “There isn’t a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon, and Saphira \\nis too young to carry us both. Besides, it’ll be safer if we stay together, and \\nriding is faster than walking.”\\n“But that’ll \\nmake it harder to catch the Ra’zac,” protested Eragon. “On Saphira, I could \\nprobably find them within a day or two. On horses, it’ll take much longer—if \\nit’s even possible to overtake their lead on the ground!”\\nBrom said \\nslowly, “That’s a chance you’ll have to take if I’m to accompany you.”\\nEragon thought \\nit over. “All right,” he grumbled, “we’ll get horses. But you have to buy them. \\nI don’t have any money, and I don’t want to steal again. It’s wrong.”\\n“That depends on \\nyour point of view,” corrected Brom with a slight smile. “Before you set out on \\nthis venture, remember that your enemies, the Ra’zac, are the king’s servants. \\nThey will be protected wherever they go. Laws do not stop them. In cities \\nthey’ll have access to abundant resources and willing servants. Also keep in \\nmind that nothing is more important to Galbatorix than recruiting or killing \\nyou—though word of your existence probably hasn’t reached him yet. The longer \\nyou evade the Ra’zac, the more desperate he’ll become. He’ll know that every \\nday you’ll be growing stronger and that each passing moment will give you \\nanother chance to join his enemies. You must be very careful, as you may easily \\nturn from the hunter into the hunted.”\\nEragon was \\nsubdued by the strong words. Pensive, he rolled a twig between his fingers. \\n“Enough talk,” said Brom. “It’s late and my bones ache. We can say more \\ntomorrow.” Eragon nodded and banked the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HERINSFORD \\nDawn was gray and \\novercast with a cutting wind. The forest was quiet. After a light breakfast, \\nBrom and Eragon doused the fire and shouldered their packs, preparing to leave. \\nEragon hung his bow and quiver on the side of his pack where he could easily \\nreach them. Saphira wore the saddle; she would have to carry it until they got \\nhorses. Eragon carefully tied Zar’roc onto her back, too, as he did not want \\nthe extra weight. Besides, in his hands the sword would be no better than a \\nclub.\\nEragon had felt \\nsafe inside the bramble, but outside, wariness crept into his movements. \\nSaphira took off and circled overhead. The trees thinned as they returned to \\nthe farm.\\nI will see this \\nplace again,Eragon \\ninsisted to himself, looking at the ruined buildings.This cannot, will not, \\nbe a permanent exile. Someday when it’s safe, I’ll return. . . . Throwing \\nback his shoulders, he faced south and the strange, barbaric lands that lay \\nthere.\\nAs they walked, \\nSaphira veered west toward the mountains and out of sight. Eragon felt \\nuncomfortable as he watched her go. Even now, with no one around, they could \\nnot spend their days together. She had to stay hidden in case they met a fellow \\ntraveler.\\nThe Ra’zac’s \\nfootprints were faint on the eroding snow, but Eragon was unconcerned. It was \\nunlikely that they had forsaken the road, which was the easiest way out of the \\nvalley, for the wilderness. Once outside the valley, however, the road divided \\nin several places. It would be difficult to ascertain which branch the Ra’zac \\nhad taken.\\nThey traveled in \\nsilence, concentrating on speed. Eragon’s legs continued to bleed where the \\nscabs had cracked. To take his mind off the discomfort, he asked, “So what \\nexactly can dragons do? You said that you knew something of their abilities.”\\nBrom laughed, \\nhis sapphire ring flashing in the air as he gestured. “Unfortunately, it’s a \\npitiful amount compared to what I would like to know. Your question is one \\npeople have been trying to answer for centuries, so understand that what I tell \\nyou is by its very nature incomplete. Dragons have always been mysterious, \\nthough maybe not on purpose.\\n“Before I can \\ntruly answer your question, you need a basic education on the subject of \\ndragons. It’s hopelessly confusing to start in the middle of such a complex \\ntopic without understanding the foundation on which it stands. I’ll begin with \\nthe life cycle of dragons, and if that doesn’t wear you out, we can continue to \\nanother topic.”\\nBrom explained \\nhow dragons mate and what it took for their eggs to hatch. “You see,” he said, \\n“when a dragon lays an egg, the infant inside is ready to hatch. But it waits, \\nsometimes for years, for the right circumstances. When dragons lived in the \\nwild, those circumstances were usually dictated by the availability of food. \\nHowever, once they formed an alliance with the elves, a certain number of their \\neggs, usually no more than one or two, were given to the Riders each year. \\nThese eggs, or rather the infants inside, wouldn’t hatch until the person \\ndestined to be its Rider came into their presence—though how they sensed that \\nisn’t known. People used to line up to touch the eggs, hoping that one of them \\nmight be picked.”\\n“Do you mean \\nthat Saphira might not have hatched for me?” asked Eragon.\\n“Quite possibly, \\nif she hadn’t liked you.”\\nHe felt honored \\nthat of all the people in Alagaësia, she had chosen him. He wondered how long \\nshe had been waiting, then shuddered at the thought of being cramped inside an \\negg, surrounded by darkness.\\nBrom continued \\nhis lecture. He explained what and when dragons ate. A fully grown sedentary \\ndragon could go for months without food, but in mating season they had to eat \\nevery week. Some plants could heal their sicknesses, while others would make \\nthem ill. There were various ways to care for their claws and clean their \\nscales.\\nHe explained the \\ntechniques to use when attacking from a dragon and what to do if you were \\nfighting one, whether on foot, horseback, or with another dragon. Their bellies \\nwere armored; their armpits were not. Eragon constantly interrupted to ask \\nquestions, and Brom seemed pleased by the inquiries. Hours passed unheeded as \\nthey talked.\\nWhen evening \\ncame, they were near Therinsford. As the sky darkened and they searched for a \\nplace to camp, Eragon asked, “Who was the Rider that owned Zar’roc?”\\n“A mighty \\nwarrior,” said Brom, “who was much feared in his time and held great power.”\\n“What was his \\nname?”\\n“I’ll not say.” \\nEragon protested, but Brom was firm. “I don’t want to keep you ignorant, far \\nfrom it, but certain knowledge would only prove dangerous and distracting for \\nyou right now. There isn’t any reason for me to trouble you with such things \\nuntil you have the time and the power to deal with them. I only wish to protect \\nyou from those who would use you for evil.”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim. “You know what? I think you just enjoy speaking in riddles. I’ve half a \\nmind to leave you so I don’t have to be bothered with them. If you’re going to \\nsay something, then say it instead of dancing around with vague phrases!”\\n“Peace. All will \\nbe told in time,” Brom said gently. Eragon grunted, unconvinced.\\nThey found a \\ncomfortable place to spend the night and set up camp. Saphira joined them as \\ndinner was being set on the fire.Did you have time to hunt for food? \\nasked Eragon.\\nShe snorted with \\namusement.If the two of you were any slower, I would have time to fly across \\nthe sea and back without falling behind.\\nYou don’t have \\nto be insulting. Besides, we’ll go faster once we have horses. \\nShe let out a \\npuff of smoke.Maybe, but will it be enough to catch the Ra’zac? They have a \\nlead of several days and many leagues. And I’m afraid they may suspect we’re \\nfollowing them. Why else would they have destroyed the farm in such a \\nspectacular manner, unless they wished to provoke you into chasing them?\\nI don’t know,said Eragon, \\ndisturbed. Saphira curled up beside him, and he leaned against her belly, \\nwelcoming the warmth. Brom sat on the other side of the fire, whittling two \\nlong sticks. He suddenly threw one at Eragon, who grabbed it out of reflex as \\nit whirled over the crackling flames.\\n“Defend \\nyourself!” barked Brom, standing.\\nEragon looked at \\nthe stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a \\nsword. Brom wanted to fight him? What chance did the old man stand?If he \\nwants to play this game, so be it, but if he thinks to beat me, he’s in for a \\nsurprise.\\nHe rose as Brom \\ncircled the fire. They faced each other for a moment, then Brom charged, \\nswinging his stick. Eragon tried to block the attack but was too slow. He \\nyelped as Brom struck him on the ribs, and stumbled backward.\\nWithout \\nthinking, he lunged forward, but Brom easily parried the blow. Eragon whipped \\nthe stick toward Brom’s head, twisted it at the last moment, and then tried to \\nhit his side. The solid smack of wood striking wood resounded through the camp. \\n“Improvisation—good!” exclaimed Brom, eyes gleaming. His arm moved in a blur, \\nand there was an explosion of pain on the side of Eragon’s head. He collapsed \\nlike an empty sack, dazed.\\nA splash of cold \\nwater roused him to alertness, and he sat up, sputtering. His head was ringing, \\nand there was dried blood on his face. Brom stood over him with a pan of melted \\nsnow water. “You didn’t have to do that,” said Eragon angrily, pushing himself \\nup. He felt dizzy and unsteady.\\nBrom arched an \\neyebrow. “Oh? A real enemy wouldn’t soften his blows, and neither will I. \\nShould I pander to your . . . incompetence so you’ll feel better? I don’t think \\nso.” He picked up the stick that Eragon had dropped and held it out. “Now, \\ndefend yourself.”\\nEragon stared \\nblankly at the piece of wood, then shook his head. “Forget it; I’ve had \\nenough.” He turned away and stumbled as he was whacked loudly across the back. \\nHe spun around, growling.\\n“Never turn your \\nback to the enemy!” snapped Brom, then tossed the stick at him and attacked. \\nEragon retreated around the fire, beneath the onslaught. “Pull your arms in. \\nKeep your knees bent,” shouted Brom. He continued to give instructions, then \\npaused to show Eragon exactly how to execute a certain move. “Do it again, but \\nthis timeslowly !” They slid through the forms with exaggerated motions \\nbefore returning to their furious battle. Eragon learned quickly, but no matter \\nwhat he tried, he could not hold Brom off for more than a few blows.\\nWhen they \\nfinished, Eragon flopped on his blankets and groaned. He hurt everywhere—Brom \\nhad not been gentle with his stick. Saphira let out a long, coughing growl and \\ncurled her lip until a formidable row of teeth showed.\\nWhat’s wrong \\nwith you?he \\ndemanded irritably.\\nNothing,she replied.It’s \\nfunny to see a hatchling like you beaten by the old one. She made the sound \\nagain, and Eragon turned red as he realized that she was laughing. Trying to \\npreserve some dignity, he rolled onto his side and fell asleep.\\nHe felt even \\nworse the next day. Bruises covered his arms, and he was almost too sore to \\nmove. Brom looked up from the mush he was serving and grinned. “How do you \\nfeel?” Eragon grunted and bolted down the breakfast.\\nOnce on the \\nroad, they traveled swiftly so as to reach Therinsford before noon. After a league, \\nthe road widened and they saw smoke in the distance. “You’d better tell Saphira \\nto fly ahead and wait for us on the other side of Therinsford,” said Brom. “She \\nhas to be careful here, otherwise people are bound to notice her.”\\n“Why don’t you \\ntell her yourself?” challenged Eragon.\\n“It’s considered \\nbad manners to interfere with another’s dragon.”\\n“You didn’t have \\na problem with it in Carvahall.”\\nBrom’s lips \\ntwitched with a smile. “I did what I had to.”\\nEragon eyed him \\ndarkly, then relayed the instructions. Saphira warned,Be careful; the \\nEmpire’s servants could be hiding anywhere.\\nAs the ruts in \\nthe road deepened, Eragon noticed more footprints. Farms signaled their \\napproach to Therinsford. The village was larger than Carvahall, but it had been \\nconstructed haphazardly, the houses aligned in no particular order.\\n“What a mess,” \\nsaid Eragon. He could not see Dempton’s mill.Baldor and Albriech have surely \\nfetched Roran by now. Either way, Eragon had no wish to face his cousin.\\n“It’s ugly, if \\nnothing else,” agreed Brom.\\nThe Anora River \\nflowed between them and the town, spanned by a stout bridge. As they approached \\nit, a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way. His shirt was \\ntoo short, and his dirty stomach spilled over a rope belt. Behind his cracked \\nlips, his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones. “You c’n stop right there. \\nThis’s my bridge. Gotta pay t’ get over.”\\n“How much?” \\nasked Brom in a resigned voice. He pulled out a pouch, and the bridgekeeper \\nbrightened.\\n“Five crowns,” \\nhe said, pulling his lips into a broad smile. Eragon’s temper flared at the \\nexorbitant price, and he started to complain hotly, but Brom silenced him with \\na quick look. The coins were wordlessly handed over. The man put them into a \\nsack hanging from his belt. “Thank’ee much,” he said in a mocking tone, and \\nstood out of the way.\\nAs Brom stepped \\nforward, he stumbled and caught the bridgekeeper’s arm to support himself. \\n“Watch y’re step,” snarled the grimy man, sidling away.\\n“Sorry,” \\napologized Brom, and continued over the bridge with Eragon.\\n“Why didn’t you \\nhaggle? He skinned you alive!” exclaimed Eragon when they were out of earshot. \\n“He probably doesn’t even own the bridge. We could have pushed right past him.”\\n“Probably,” \\nagreed Brom.\\n“Then why pay \\nhim?”\\n“Because you can’t \\nargue with all of the fools in the world. It’s easier to let them have their \\nway, then trick them when they’re not paying attention.” Brom opened his hand, \\nand a pile of coins glinted in the light.\\n“You cut his \\npurse!” said Eragon incredulously.\\nBrom pocketed \\nthe money with a wink. “And it held a surprising amount. He should know better \\nthan to keep all these coins in one place.” There was a sudden howl of anguish \\nfrom the other side of the river. “I’d say our friend has just discovered his \\nloss. If you see any watchmen, tell me.” He grabbed the shoulder of a young boy \\nrunning between the houses and asked, “Do you know where we can buy horses?” \\nThe child stared at them with solemn eyes, then pointed to a large barn near \\nthe edge of Therinsford. “Thank you,” said Brom, tossing him a small coin.\\nThe barn’s large \\ndouble doors were open, revealing two long rows of stalls. The far wall was \\ncovered with saddles, harnesses, and other paraphernalia. A man with muscular \\narms stood at the end, brushing a white stallion. He raised a hand and beckoned \\nfor them to come over.\\nAs they \\napproached, Brom said, “That’s a beautiful animal.”\\n“Yes indeed. His \\nname’s Snowfire. Mine’s Haberth.” Haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands \\nvigorously with Eragon and Brom. There was a polite pause as he waited for \\ntheir names in return. When they were not forthcoming, he asked, “Can I help \\nyou?”\\nBrom nodded. “We \\nneed two horses and a full set of tack for both. The horses have to be fast and \\ntough; we’ll be doing a lot of traveling.”\\nHaberth was \\nthoughtful for a moment. “I don’t have many animals like that, and the ones I \\ndo aren’t cheap.” The stallion moved restlessly; he calmed it with a few \\nstrokes of his fingers.\\n“Price is no \\nobject. I’ll take the best you have,” said Brom. Haberth nodded and silently \\ntied the stallion to a stall. He went to the wall and started pulling down \\nsaddles and other items. Soon he had two identical piles. Next he walked up the \\nline of stalls and brought out two horses. One was a light bay, the other a roan. \\nThe bay tugged against his rope.\\n“He’s a little \\nspirited, but with a firm hand you won’t have any problems,” said Haberth, \\nhanding the bay’s rope to Brom.\\nBrom let the \\nhorse smell his hand; it allowed him to rub its neck. “We’ll take him,” he \\nsaid, then eyed the roan. “The other one, however, I’m not so sure of.”\\n“There are some \\ngood legs on him.”\\n“Mmm . . . What \\nwill you take for Snowfire?”\\nHaberth looked \\nfondly at the stallion. “I’d rather not sell him. He’s the finest I’ve ever \\nbred—I’m hoping to sire a whole line from him.”\\n“If you were \\nwilling to part with him, how much would all of this cost me?” asked Brom.\\nEragon tried to \\nput his hand on the bay like Brom had, but it shied away. He automatically \\nreached out with his mind to reassure the horse, stiffening with surprise as he \\ntouched the animal’s consciousness. The contact was not clear or sharp like it \\nwas with Saphira, but he could communicate with the bay to a limited degree. \\nTentatively, he made it understand that he was a friend. The horse calmed and \\nlooked at him with liquid brown eyes.\\nHaberth used his \\nfingers to add up the price of the purchase. “Two hundred crowns and no less,” \\nhe said with a smile, clearly confident that no one would pay that much. Brom \\nsilently opened his pouch and counted out the money.\\n“Will this do?” \\nhe asked.\\nThere was a long \\nsilence as Haberth glanced between Snowfire and the coins. A sigh, then, “He is \\nyours, though I go against my heart.”\\n“I will treat \\nhim as if he had been sired by Gildintor, the greatest steed of legend,” said \\nBrom.\\n“Your words \\ngladden me,” answered Haberth, bowing his head slightly. He helped them saddle \\nthe horses. When they were ready to leave, he said, “Farewell, then. For the \\nsake of Snowfire, I hope that misfortune does not befall you.”\\n“Do not fear; I \\nwill guard him well,” promised Brom as they departed. “Here,” he said, handing \\nSnowfire’s reins to Eragon, “go to the far side of Therinsford and wait there.”\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon, but Brom had already slipped away. Annoyed, he exited Therinsford with \\nthe two horses and stationed himself beside the road. To the south he saw the \\nhazy outline of Utgard, sitting like a giant monolith at the end of the valley. \\nIts peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight, towering over the lesser \\nmountains that surrounded it. Its dark, ominous look made Eragon’s scalp \\ntingle.\\nBrom returned \\nshortly and gestured for Eragon to follow. They walked until Therinsford was \\nhidden by trees. Then Brom said, “The Ra’zac definitely passed this way. \\nApparently they stopped here to pick up horses, as we did. I was able to find a \\nman who saw them. He described them with many shudders and said that they \\ngalloped out of Therinsford like demons fleeing a holy man.”\\n“They left quite \\nan impression.”\\n“Quite.”\\nEragon patted \\nthe horses. “When we were in the barn, I touched the bay’s mind by accident. I \\ndidn’t know it was possible to do that.”\\nBrom frowned. \\n“It’s unusual for one as young as you to have the ability. Most Riders had to \\ntrain for years before they were strong enough to contact anything other than \\ntheir dragon.” His face was thoughtful as he inspected Snowfire. Then he said, \\n“Take everything from your pack, put it into the saddlebags, and tie the pack \\non top.” Eragon did so while Brom mounted Snowfire.\\nEragon gazed \\ndoubtfully at the bay. It was so much smaller than Saphira that for an absurd \\nmoment he wondered if it could bear his weight. With a sigh, he awkwardly got \\ninto the saddle. He had only ridden horses bareback and never for any distance. \\n“Is this going to do the same thing to my legs as riding Saphira?” he asked.\\n“How do they \\nfeel now?”\\n“Not too bad, \\nbut I think any hard riding will open them up again.”\\n“We’ll take it \\neasy,” promised Brom. He gave Eragon a few pointers, then they started off at a \\ngentle pace. Before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields \\nyielded to wilder land. Brambles and tangled weeds lined the road, along with \\nhuge rosebushes that clung to their clothes. Tall rocks slanted out of the \\nground—gray witnesses to their presence. There was an unfriendly feel in the \\nair, an animosity that resisted intruders.\\nAbove them, \\ngrowing larger with every step, loomed Utgard, its craggy precipices deeply \\nfurrowed with snowy canyons. The black rock of the mountain absorbed light like \\na sponge and dimmed the surrounding area. Between Utgard and the line of \\nmountains that formed the east side of Palancar Valley was a deep cleft. It was \\nthe only practical way out of the valley. The road led toward it.\\nThe horses’ \\nhooves clacked sharply over gravel, and the road dwindled to a skinny trail as \\nit skirted the base of Utgard. Eragon glanced up at the peak looming over them \\nand was startled to see a steepled tower perched upon it. The turret was \\ncrumbling and in disrepair, but it was still a stern sentinel over the valley. \\n“What is that?” he asked, pointing.\\nBrom did not \\nlook up, but said sadly and with bitterness, “An outpost of the Riders—one that \\nhas lasted since their founding. That was where Vrael took refuge, and where, \\nthrough treachery, he was found and defeated by Galbatorix. When Vrael fell, \\nthis area was tainted. Edoc’sil, ‘Unconquerable,’ was the name of this bastion, \\nfor the mountain is so steep none may reach the top unless they can fly. After \\nVrael’s death the commoners called it Utgard, but it has another name, \\nRistvak’baen—the ‘Place of Sorrow.’ It was known as such to the last Riders \\nbefore they were killed by the king.”\\nEragon stared \\nwith awe. Here was a tangible remnant of the Riders’ glory, tarnished though it \\nwas by the relentless pull of time. It struck him then just how old the Riders \\nwere. A legacy of tradition and heroism that stretched back to antiquity had \\nfallen upon him.\\nThey traveled \\nfor long hours around Utgard. It formed a solid wall to their right as they \\nentered the breach that divided the mountain range. Eragon stood in his \\nstirrups; he was impatient to see what lay outside of Palancar, but it was \\nstill too far away. For a while they were in a sloped pass, winding over hill \\nand gully, following the Anora River. Then, with the sun low behind their \\nbacks, they mounted a rise and saw over the trees.\\nEragon gasped. \\nOn either side were mountains, but below them stretched a huge plain that \\nextended to the distant horizon and fused into the sky. The plain was a uniform \\ntan, like the color of dead grass. Long, wispy clouds swept by overhead, shaped \\nby fierce winds.\\nHe understood \\nnow why Brom had insisted on horses. It would have taken them weeks or months \\nto cover that vast distance on foot. Far above he saw Saphira circling, high \\nenough to be mistaken for a bird.\\n“We’ll wait \\nuntil tomorrow to make the descent,” said Brom. “It’s going to take most of the \\nday, so we should camp now.”\\n“How far across \\nis the plain?” Eragon asked, still amazed.\\n“Two or three \\ndays to over a fortnight, depending on which direction we go. Aside from the \\nnomad tribes that roam this section of the plains, it’s almost as uninhabited \\nas the Hadarac Desert to the east. So we aren’t going to find many villages. \\nHowever, to the south the plains are less arid and more heavily populated.”\\nThey left the \\ntrail and dismounted by the Anora River. As they unsaddled the horses, Brom \\ngestured at the bay. “You should name him.”\\nEragon \\nconsidered it as he picketed the bay. “Well, I don’t have anything as noble as \\nSnowfire, but maybe this will do.” He placed his hand on the bay and said, “I \\nname you Cadoc. It was my grandfather’s name, so bear it well.” Brom nodded in \\napproval, but Eragon felt slightly foolish.\\nWhen Saphira \\nlanded, he asked, How do the plains look?\\nDull. There’s \\nnothing but rabbits and scrub in every direction. \\nAfter dinner, \\nBrom stood and barked, “Catch!” Eragon barely had time to raise his arm and \\ngrab the piece of wood before it hit him on the head. He groaned as he saw \\nanother makeshift sword.\\n“Not again,” he \\ncomplained. Brom just smiled and beckoned with one hand. Eragon reluctantly got \\nto his feet. They whirled around in a flurry of smacking wood, and he backed \\naway with a stinging arm.\\nThe training \\nsession was shorter than the first, but it was still long enough for Eragon to \\namass a new collection of bruises. When they finished sparring, he threw down \\nthe stick in disgust and stalked away from the fire to nurse his injuries.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HUNDERROAR ANDLIGHTNINGCRACKLE\\nThe next morning Eragon \\navoided bringing to mind any of the recent events; they were too painful for \\nhim to consider. Instead, he focused his energies on figuring out how to find \\nand kill the Ra’zac.I’ll do it with my bow, he decided, imagining how \\nthe cloaked figures would look with arrows sticking out of them.\\nHe had \\ndifficulty even standing up. His muscles cramped with the slightest movement, \\nand one of his fingers was hot and swollen. When they were ready to leave, he \\nmounted Cadoc and said acidly, “If this keeps up, you’re going to batter me to \\npieces.”\\n“I wouldn’t push \\nyou so hard if I didn’t think you were strong enough.”\\n“For once, I \\nwouldn’t mind being thought less of,” muttered Eragon.\\nCadoc pranced \\nnervously as Saphira approached. Saphira eyed the horse with something close to \\ndisgust and said,There’s nowhere to hide on the plains, so I’m not going to \\nbother trying to stay out of sight. I’ll just fly above you from now on.\\nShe took off, \\nand they began the steep descent. In many places the trail all but disappeared, \\nleaving them to find their own way down. At times they had to dismount and lead \\nthe horses on foot, holding on to trees to keep from falling down the slope. \\nThe ground was scattered with loose rocks, which made the footing treacherous. \\nThe ordeal left them hot and irritable, despite the cold.\\nThey stopped to \\nrest when they reached the bottom near midday. The Anora River veered to their \\nleft and flowed northward. A biting wind scoured the land, whipping them \\nunmercifully. The soil was parched, and dirt flew into their eyes.\\nIt unnerved \\nEragon how flat everything was; the plains were unbroken by hummocks or mounds. \\nHe had lived his entire life surrounded by mountains and hills. Without them he \\nfelt exposed and vulnerable, like a mouse under an eagle’s keen eye.\\nThe trail split \\nin three once it reached the plains. The first branch turned north, toward \\nCeunon, one of the greatest northern cities; the second one led straight across \\nthe plains; and the last went south. They examined all three for traces of the \\nRa’zac and eventually found their tracks, heading directly into the grasslands.\\n“It seems \\nthey’ve gone to Yazuac,” said Brom with a perplexed air.\\n“Where’s that?”\\n“Due east and \\nfour days away, if all goes well. It’s a small village situated by the Ninor \\nRiver.” He gestured at the Anora, which streamed away from them to the north. \\n“Our only supply of water is here. We’ll have to replenish our waterskins \\nbefore attempting to cross the plains. There isn’t another pool or stream \\nbetween here and Yazuac.”\\nThe excitement \\nof the hunt began to rise within Eragon. In a few days, maybe less than a week, \\nhe would use his arrows to avenge Garrow’s death.And then . . . He \\nrefused to think about what might happen afterward.\\nThey filled the \\nwaterskins, watered the horses, and drank as much as they could from the river. \\nSaphira joined them and took several gulps of water. Fortified, they turned \\neastward and started across the plains.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon decided \\nthat it would be the wind that drove him crazy first. Everything that made him \\nmiserable—his chapped lips, parched tongue, and burning eyes—stemmed from it. \\nThe ceaseless gusting followed them throughout the day. Evening only \\nstrengthened the wind, instead of subduing it.\\nSince there was \\nno shelter, they were forced to camp in the open. Eragon found some scrub \\nbrush, a short tough plant that thrived on harsh conditions, and pulled it up. \\nHe made a careful pile and tried to light it, but the woody stems only smoked \\nand gave off a pungent smell. Frustrated, he tossed the tinderbox to Brom. “I \\ncan’t make it burn, especially with this blasted wind. See if you can get it \\ngoing: otherwise dinner will be cold.”\\nBrom knelt by \\nthe brush and looked at it critically. He rearranged a couple of branches, then \\nstruck the tinderbox, sending a cascade of sparks onto the plants. There was \\nsmoke, but nothing else. Brom scowled and tried again, but his luck was no \\nbetter than Eragon’s. “Brisingr!” he swore angrily, striking the flint again. \\nFlames suddenly appeared, and he stepped back with a pleased expression. “There \\nwe go. It must have been smoldering inside.”\\nThey sparred \\nwith mock swords while the food cooked. Fatigue made it hard on both of them, \\nso they kept the session short. After they had eaten, they lay next to Saphira \\nand slept, grateful for her shelter.\\nThe same cold \\nwind greeted them in the morning, sweeping over the dreadful flatness. Eragon’s \\nlips had cracked during the night; every time he smiled or talked, beads of \\nblood covered them. Licking them only made it worse. It was the same for Brom. \\nThey let the horses drink sparingly from their supply of water before mounting \\nthem. The day was a monotonous trek of endless plodding.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the third \\nday, Eragon woke well rested. That, coupled with the fact that the wind had stopped, \\nput him in a cheery humor. His high spirits were dampened, however, when he saw \\nthe sky ahead of them was dark with thunderheads.\\nBrom looked at \\nthe clouds and grimaced. “Normally I wouldn’t go into a storm like that, but \\nwe’re in for a battering no matter what we do, so we might as well get some \\ndistance covered.”\\nIt was still \\ncalm when they reached the storm front. As they entered its shadow, Eragon \\nlooked up. The thundercloud had an exotic structure, forming a natural \\ncathedral with a massive arched roof. With some imagination he could see \\npillars, windows, soaring tiers, and snarling gargoyles. It was a wild beauty.\\nAs Eragon \\nlowered his gaze, a giant ripple raced toward them through the grass, \\nflattening it. It took him a second to realize that the wave was a tremendous \\nblast of wind. Brom saw it too, and they hunched their shoulders, preparing for \\nthe storm.\\nThe gale was \\nalmost upon them when Eragon had a horrible thought and twisted in his saddle, \\nyelling, both with his voice and mind,“Saphira! Land!” Brom’s face grew \\npale. Overhead, they saw her dive toward the ground.She’s not going to make \\nit!\\nSaphira angled \\nback the way they had come, to gain time. As they watched, the tempest’s wrath \\nstruck them like a hammer blow. Eragon gasped for breath and clenched the \\nsaddle as a frenzied howling filled his ears. Cadoc swayed and dug his hooves \\ninto the ground, mane snapping in the air. The wind tore at their clothes with \\ninvisible fingers while the air darkened with billowing clouds of dust.\\nEragon squinted, \\nsearching for Saphira. He saw her land heavily and then crouch, clenching the \\nground with her talons. The wind reached her just as she started to fold her \\nwings. With an angry yank, it unfurled them and dragged her into the air. For a \\nmoment she hung there, suspended by the storm’s force. Then it slammed her down \\non her back.\\nWith a savage \\nwrench, Eragon yanked Cadoc around and galloped back up the trail, goading the \\nhorse with both heels and mind.Saphira! he shouted.Try to stay on the \\nground. I’m coming! He felt a grim acknowledgment from her. As they neared \\nSaphira, Cadoc balked, so Eragon leapt down and ran toward her.\\nHis bow banged \\nagainst his head. A strong gust pushed him off balance and he flew forward, \\nlanding on his chest. He skidded, then got back up with a snarl, ignoring the \\ndeep scrapes in his skin.\\nSaphira was only \\nthree yards away, but he could get no closer because of her flailing wings. She \\nstruggled to fold them against the overpowering gale. He rushed at her right \\nwing, intending to hold it down, but the wind caught her and she somersaulted \\nover him. The spines on her back missed his head by inches. Saphira clawed at \\nthe ground, trying to stay down.\\nHer wings began \\nto lift again, but before they could flip her, Eragon threw himself at the left \\none. The wing crumpled in at the joints and Saphira tucked it firmly against \\nher body. Eragon vaulted over her back and tumbled onto the other wing. Without \\nwarning it was blown upward, sending him sliding to ground. He broke his fall \\nwith a roll, then jumped up and grabbed the wing again. Saphira started to fold \\nit, and he pushed with all of his strength. The wind battled with them for a \\nsecond, but with one last surge they overcame it.\\nEragon leaned \\nagainst Saphira, panting.Are you all right? He could feel her trembling.\\nShe took a \\nmoment to answer.I . . . I think so. She sounded shaken.Nothing’s \\nbroken—I couldn’t do anything; the wind wouldn’t let me go. I was helpless. \\nWith a shudder, she fell silent.\\nHe looked at \\nher, concerned.Don’t worry, you’re safe now. He spotted Cadoc a ways \\noff, standing with his back to the wind. With his mind, Eragon instructed the \\nhorse to return to Brom. He then got onto Saphira. She crept up the road, \\nfighting the gale while he clung to her back and kept his head down.\\nWhen they \\nreached Brom, he shouted over the storm, “Is she hurt?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead and dismounted. Cadoc trotted over to him, nickering. As he stroked the \\nhorse’s long cheek, Brom pointed at a dark curtain of rain sweeping toward them \\nin rippling gray sheets. “What else?” cried Eragon, pulling his clothes \\ntighter. He winced as the torrent reached them. The stinging rain was cold as \\nice; before long they were drenched and shivering.\\nLightning lanced \\nthrough the sky, flickering in and out of existence. Mile-high blue bolts \\nstreaked across the horizon, followed by peals of thunder that shook the ground \\nbelow. It was beautiful, but dangerously so. Here and there, grass fires were \\nignited by strikes, only to be extinguished by the rain.\\nThe wild elements \\nwere slow to abate, but as the day passed, they wandered elsewhere. Once again \\nthe sky was revealed, and the setting sun glowed with brilliance. As beams of \\nlight tinted the clouds with blazing colors, everything gained a sharp \\ncontrast: brightly lit on one side, deeply shadowed on the other. Objects had a \\nunique sense of mass; grass stalks seemed sturdy as marble pillars. Ordinary \\nthings took on an unearthly beauty; Eragon felt as if he were sitting inside a \\npainting.\\nThe rejuvenated \\nearth smelled fresh, clearing their minds and raising their spirits. Saphira \\nstretched, craning her neck, and roared happily. The horses skittered away from \\nher, but Eragon and Brom smiled at her exuberance.\\nBefore the light \\nfaded, they stopped for the night in a shallow depression. Too exhausted to \\nspar, they went straight to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nR EVELATION ATYAZUAC\\nAlthough they had \\nmanaged to partially refill the waterskins during the storm, they drank the \\nlast of their water that morning. “I hope we’re going in the right direction,” \\nsaid Eragon, crunching up the empty water bag, “because we’ll be in trouble if \\nwe don’t reach Yazuac today.”\\nBrom did not \\nseem disturbed. “I’ve traveled this way before. Yazuac will be in sight before \\ndusk.”\\nEragon laughed \\ndoubtfully. “Perhaps you see something I don’t. How can you know that when \\neverything looks exactly the same for leagues around?”\\n“Because I am \\nguided not by the land, but by the stars and sun. They will not lead us astray. \\nCome! Let us be off. It is foolish to conjure up woe where none exists. Yazuac \\nwill be there.”\\nHis words proved \\ntrue. Saphira spotted the village first, but it was not until later in the day \\nthat the rest of them saw it as a dark bump on the horizon. Yazuac was still \\nvery far away; it was only visible because of the plain’s uniform flatness. As \\nthey rode closer, a dark winding line appeared on either side of the town and \\ndisappeared in the distance.\\n“The Ninor \\nRiver,” said Brom, pointing at it.\\nEragon pulled \\nCadoc to a stop. “Saphira will be seen if she stays with us much longer. Should \\nshe hide while we go into Yazuac?”\\nBrom scratched \\nhis chin and looked at the town. “See that bend in the river? Have her wait \\nthere. It’s far enough from Yazuac so no one should find her, but close enough \\nthat she won’t be left behind. We’ll go through the town, get what we need, and \\nthen meet her.”\\nI don’t like it,said Saphira \\nwhen Eragon had explained the plan.This is irritating, having to hide all \\nthe time like a criminal.\\nYou know what \\nwould happen if we were revealed.She grumbled but gave in and flew away \\nlow to the ground.\\nThey kept a \\nswift pace in anticipation of the food and drink they would soon enjoy. As they \\napproached the small houses, they could see smoke from a dozen chimneys, but \\nthere was no one in the streets. An abnormal silence enveloped the village. By \\nunspoken consent they stopped before the first house. Eragon abruptly said, \\n“There aren’t any dogs barking.”\\n“No.”\\n“Doesn’t mean \\nanything, though.”\\n“. . . No.”\\nEragon paused. \\n“Someone should have seen us by now.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then why hasn’t \\nanyone come out?”\\nBrom squinted at \\nthe sun. “Could be afraid.”\\n“Could be,” said \\nEragon. He was quiet for a moment. “And if it’s a trap? The Ra’zac might be \\nwaiting for us.”\\n“We need \\nprovisions and water.”\\n“There’s the \\nNinor.”\\n“Still need \\nprovisions.”\\n“True.” Eragon \\nlooked around. “So we go in?”\\nBrom flicked his \\nreins. “Yes, but not like fools. This is the main entrance to Yazuac. If \\nthere’s an ambush, it’ll be along here. No one will expect us to arrive from a \\ndifferent direction.”\\n“Around to the \\nside, then?” asked Eragon. Brom nodded and pulled out his sword, resting the \\nbare blade across his saddle. Eragon strung his bow and nocked an arrow.\\nThey trotted \\nquietly around the town and entered it cautiously. The streets were empty, \\nexcept for a small fox that darted away as they came near. The houses were dark \\nand foreboding, with shattered windows. Many of the doors swung on broken \\nhinges. The horses rolled their eyes nervously. Eragon’s palm tingled, but he \\nresisted the urge to scratch it. As they rode into the center of town, he \\ngripped his bow tighter, blanching. “Gods above,” he whispered.\\nA mountain of \\nbodies rose above them, the corpses stiff and grimacing. Their clothes were \\nsoaked in blood, and the churned ground was stained with it. Slaughtered men \\nlay over the women they had tried to protect, mothers still clasped their \\nchildren, and lovers who had tried to shield each other rested in death’s cold \\nembrace. Black arrows stuck out of them all. Neither young nor old had been \\nspared. But worst of all was the barbed spear that rose out of the peak of the \\npile, impaling the white body of a baby.\\nTears blurred \\nEragon’s vision and he tried to look away, but the dead faces held his \\nattention. He stared at their open eyes and wondered how life could have left \\nthem so easily.What does our existence mean when it can end like this? A \\nwave of hopelessness overwhelmed him.\\nA crow dipped \\nout of the sky, like a black shadow, and perched on the spear. It cocked its \\nhead and greedily scrutinized the infant’s corpse. “Oh no you don’t,” snarled \\nEragon as he pulled back the bowstring and released it with a twang. With a \\npuff of feathers, the crow fell over backward, the arrow protruding from its \\nchest. Eragon fit another arrow to the string, but nausea rose from his stomach \\nand he threw up over Cadoc’s side.\\nBrom patted him \\non the back. When Eragon was done, Brom asked gently, “Do you want to wait for \\nme outside Yazuac?”\\n“No . . . I’ll \\nstay,” said Eragon shakily, wiping his mouth. He avoided looking at the \\ngruesome sight before them. “Who could have done . . .” He could not force out \\nthe words.\\nBrom bowed his \\nhead. “Those who love the pain and suffering of others. They wear many faces \\nand go by many disguises, but there is only one name for them: evil. There is \\nno understanding it. All we can do is pity and honor the victims.”\\nHe dismounted \\nSnowfire and walked around, inspecting the trampled ground carefully. “The \\nRa’zac passed this way,” he said slowly, “but this wasn’t their doing. This is \\nUrgal work; the spear is of their make. A company of them came through here, \\nperhaps as many as a hundred. It’s odd; I know of only a few instances when \\nthey have gathered in such . . .” He knelt and examined a footprint intently. \\nWith a curse he ran back to Snowfire and leapt onto him.\\n“Ride!” he \\nhissed tightly, spurring Snowfire forward. “There are still Urgals here!” \\nEragon jammed his heels into Cadoc. The horse jumped forward and raced after \\nSnowfire. They dashed past the houses and were almost to the edge of Yazuac \\nwhen Eragon’s palm tingled again. He saw a flicker of movement to his right, \\nthen a giant fist smashed him out of the saddle. He flew back over Cadoc and \\ncrashed into a wall, holding on to his bow only by instinct. Gasping and \\nstunned, he staggered upright, hugging his side.\\nAn Urgal stood \\nover him, face set in a gross leer. The monster was tall, thick, and broader \\nthan a doorway, with gray skin and yellow piggish eyes. Muscles bulged on his \\narms and chest, which was covered by a too small breastplate. An iron cap \\nrested over the pair of ram’s horns curling from his temples, and a roundshield \\nwas bound to one arm. His powerful hand held a short, wicked sword.\\nBehind him, \\nEragon saw Brom rein in Snowfire and start back, only to be stopped by the \\nappearance of a second Urgal, this one with an ax. “Run, you fool!” Brom cried \\nto Eragon, cleaving at his enemy. The Urgal in front of Eragon roared and swung \\nhis sword mightily. Eragon jerked back with a startled yelp as the weapon \\nwhistled past his cheek. He spun around and fled toward the center of Yazuac, \\nheart pounding wildly.\\nThe Urgal \\npursued him, heavy boots thudding. Eragon sent a desperate cry for help to \\nSaphira, then forced himself to go even faster. The Urgal rapidly gained ground \\ndespite Eragon’s efforts; large fangs separated in a soundless bellow. With the \\nUrgal almost upon him, Eragon strung an arrow, spun to a stop, took aim, and \\nreleased. The Urgal snapped up his arm and caught the quivering bolt on his \\nshield. The monster collided with Eragon before he could shoot again, and they \\nfell to the ground in a confused tangle.\\nEragon sprang to \\nhis feet and rushed back to Brom, who was trading fierce blows with his \\nopponent from Snowfire’s back.Where are the rest of the Urgals? wondered \\nEragon frantically.Are these two the only ones in Yazuac? There was a \\nloud smack, and Snowfire reared, whinnying. Brom doubled over in his saddle, \\nblood streaming down his arm. The Urgal beside him howled in triumph and raised \\nhis ax for the death blow.\\nA deafening \\nscream tore out of Eragon as he charged the Urgal, headfirst. The Urgal paused \\nin astonishment, then faced him contemptuously, swinging his ax. Eragon ducked \\nunder the two-handed blow and clawed the Urgal’s side, leaving bloody furrows. \\nThe Urgal’s face twisted with rage. He slashed again, but missed as Eragon \\ndived to the side and scrambled down an alley.\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on leading the Urgals away from Brom. He slipped into a narrow passageway \\nbetween two houses, saw it was a dead end, and slid to a stop. He tried to back \\nout, but the Urgals had already blocked the entrance. They advanced, cursing \\nhim in their gravelly voices. Eragon swung his head from side to side, \\nsearching for a way out, but there was none.\\nAs he faced the \\nUrgals, images flashed in his mind: dead villagers piled around the spear and \\nan innocent baby who would never grow to adulthood. At the thought of their \\nfate, a burning, fiery power gathered from every part of his body. It was more \\nthan a desire for justice. It was his entire being rebelling against the fact \\nof death—that he would cease to exist. The power grew stronger and stronger \\nuntil he felt ready to burst from the contained force.\\nHe stood tall \\nand straight, all fear gone. He raised his bow smoothly. The Urgals laughed and \\nlifted their shields. Eragon sighted down the shaft, as he had done hundreds of \\ntimes, and aligned the arrowhead with his target. The energy inside him burned \\nat an unbearable level. He had to release it, or it would consume him. A word \\nsuddenly leapt unbidden to his lips. He shot, yelling, “Brisingr!”\\nThe arrow hissed \\nthrough the air, glowing with a crackling blue light. It struck the lead Urgal \\non the forehead, and the air resounded with an explosion. A blue shock wave \\nblasted out of the monster’s head, killing the other Urgal instantly. It \\nreached Eragon before he had time to react, and it passed through him without \\nharm, dissipating against the houses.\\nEragon stood \\npanting, then looked at his icy palm. The gedwëy ignasia was glowing like \\nwhite-hot metal, yet even as he watched, it faded back to normal. He clenched \\nhis fist, then a wave of exhaustion washed over him. He felt strange and \\nfeeble, as if he had not eaten for days. His knees buckled, and he sagged \\nagainst a wall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA DMONISHMENTS \\nOnce a modicum of \\nstrength returned to him, Eragon staggered out of the alley, skirting the dead \\nmonsters. He did not get far before Cadoc trotted to his side. “Good, you \\nweren’t hurt,” mumbled Eragon. He noticed, without particularly caring, that \\nhis hands were shaking violently and his movements were jerky. He felt \\ndetached, as if everything he saw were happening to someone else.\\nEragon found \\nSnowfire, nostrils flared and ears flat against his head, prancing by the \\ncorner of a house, ready to bolt. Brom was still slumped motionless in the \\nsaddle. Eragon reached out with his mind and soothed the horse. Once Snowfire \\nrelaxed, Eragon went to Brom.\\nThere was a \\nlong, blood-soaked cut on the old man’s right arm. The wound bled profusely, \\nbut it was neither deep nor wide. Still, Eragon knew it had to be bound before \\nBrom lost too much blood. He stroked Snowfire for a moment, then slid Brom out \\nof the saddle. The weight proved too much for him, and Brom dropped heavily to \\nthe ground. Eragon was shocked by his own weakness.\\nA scream of rage \\nfilled his head. Saphira dived out of the sky and landed fiercely in front of \\nhim, keeping her wings half raised. She hissed angrily, eyes burning. Her tail \\nlashed, and Eragon winced as it snapped overhead.Are you hurt? she \\nasked, rage boiling in her voice.\\n“No,” he assured \\nher as he laid Brom on his back.\\nShe growled and \\nexclaimed,Where are the ones who did this? I will tear them apart!\\nHe wearily \\npointed in the direction of the alley. “It’ll do no good; they’re already \\ndead.”\\nYou killed them?Saphira sounded \\nsurprised.\\nHe nodded. \\n“Somehow.” With a few terse words, he told her what had happened while he \\nsearched his saddlebags for the rags in which Zar’roc had been wrapped.\\nSaphira said \\ngravely,You have grown.\\nEragon grunted. \\nHe found a long rag and carefully rolled back Brom’s sleeve. With a few deft \\nstrokes he cleaned the cut and bandaged it tightly.I wish we were still in \\nPalancar Valley , he said to Saphira.There, at least, I knew what plants \\nwere good for healing. Here, I don’t have any idea what will help him. He \\nretrieved Brom’s sword from the ground, wiped it, then returned it to the \\nsheath on Brom’s belt.\\nWe should leave,said Saphira.There \\nmay be more Urgals lurking about.\\nCan you carry \\nBrom?Your saddle will hold him in place, and you can protect him. \\nYes, but I’m not \\nleaving you alone.\\n\\nFine, fly next \\nto me, but let’s get out of here.He tied the saddle onto Saphira, then \\nput his arms around Brom and tried to lift him, but again his diminished \\nstrength failed him.Saphira—help.\\nShe snaked her \\nhead past him and caught the back of Brom’s robe between her teeth. Arching her \\nneck, she lifted the old man off the ground, like a cat would a kitten, and \\ndeposited him onto her back. Then Eragon slipped Brom’s legs through the \\nsaddle’s straps and tightened them. He looked up when the old man moaned and \\nshifted.\\nBrom blinked \\nblearily, putting a hand to his head. He gazed down at Eragon with concern. \\n“Did Saphira get here in time?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “I’ll explain it later. Your arm is injured. I bandaged it as best I \\ncould, but you need a safe place to rest.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nBrom, gingerly touching his arm. “Do you know where my sword . . . Ah, I see \\nyou found it.”\\nEragon finished \\ntightening the straps. “Saphira’s going to take you and follow me by air.”\\n“Are you sure \\nyou want me to ride her?” asked Brom. “I can ride Snowfire.”\\n“Not with that \\narm. This way, even if you faint, you won’t fall off.”\\nBrom nodded. \\n“I’m honored.” He wrapped his good arm around Saphira’s neck, and she took off \\nin a flurry, springing high into the sky. Eragon backed away, buffeted by the \\neddies from her wings, and returned to the horses.\\nHe tied Snowfire \\nbehind Cadoc, then left Yazuac, returning to the trail and following it \\nsouthward. It led through a rocky area, veered left, and continued along the \\nbank of the Ninor River. Ferns, mosses, and small bushes dotted the side of the \\npath. It was refreshingly cool under the trees, but Eragon did not let the \\nsoothing air lull him into a sense of security. He stopped briefly to fill the \\nwaterskins and let the horses drink. Glancing down, he saw the Ra’zac’s spoor.At \\nleast we’re going in the right direction. Saphira circled overhead, keeping \\na keen eye on him.\\nIt disturbed him \\nthat they had seen only two Urgals. The villagers had been killed and Yazuac \\nransacked by a large horde, yet where was it?Perhaps the ones we encountered \\nwere a rear guard or a trap left for anyone who was following the main force.\\nHis thoughts \\nturned to how he had killed the Urgals. An idea, a revelation, slowly wormed \\nits way through his mind. He, Eragon—farm boy of Palancar Valley—had used \\nmagic.Magic! It was the only word for what had happened. It seemed \\nimpossible, but he could not deny what he had seen.Somehow I’ve become a \\nsorcerer or wizard! But he did not know how to use this new power again or \\nwhat its limits and dangers might be.How can I have this ability? Was it \\ncommon among the Riders? And if Brom knew of it, why didn’t he tell me? He \\nshook his head in wonder and bewilderment.\\nHe conversed \\nwith Saphira to check on Brom’s condition and to share his thoughts. She was \\njust as puzzled as he was about the magic.Saphira, can you find us a place \\nto stay? I can’t see very far down here. While she searched, he continued \\nalong the Ninor.\\nThe summons \\nreached him just as the light was fading.Come. Saphira sent him an image \\nof a secluded clearing in the trees by the river. Eragon turned the horses in \\nthe new direction and nudged them into a trot. With Saphira’s help it was easy \\nto find, but it was so well hidden that he doubted anyone else would notice it.\\nA small, \\nsmokeless fire was already burning when he entered the clearing. Brom sat next \\nto it, tending his arm, which he held at an awkward angle. Saphira was crouched \\nbeside him, her body tense. She looked intently at Eragon and asked,Are you \\nsure you aren’t hurt?\\nNot on the \\noutside . . . but I’m not sure about the rest of me. \\nI should have \\nbeen there sooner.\\n\\nDon’t feel bad. \\nWe all made mistakes today. Mine was not staying closer to you.Her gratitude \\nfor that remark washed over him. He looked at Brom. “How are you?”\\nThe old man \\nglanced at his arm. “It’s a large scratch and hurts terribly, but it should \\nheal quickly enough. I need a fresh bandage; this one didn’t last as long as \\nI’d hoped.” They boiled water to wash Brom’s wound. Then Brom tied a fresh rag \\nto his arm and said, “I must eat, and you look hungry as well. Let’s have \\ndinner first, then talk.”\\nWhen their \\nbellies were full and warm, Brom lit his pipe. “Now, I think it’s time for you \\nto tell me what transpired while I was unconscious. I am most curious.” His \\nface reflected the flickering firelight, and his bushy eyebrows stuck out \\nfiercely.\\nEragon nervously \\nclasped his hands and told the story without embellishment. Brom remained \\nsilent throughout it, his face inscrutable. When Eragon finished, Brom looked \\ndown at the ground. For a long time the only sound was the snapping fire. Brom \\nfinally stirred. “Have you used this power before?”\\n“No. Do you know \\nanything about it?”\\n“A little.” \\nBrom’s face was thoughtful. “It seems I owe you a debt for saving my life. I \\nhope I can return the favor someday. You should be proud; few escape unscathed \\nfrom slaying their first Urgal. But the manner in which you did it was very \\ndangerous. You could have destroyed yourself and the whole town.”\\n“It wasn’t as if \\nI had a choice,” said Eragon defensively. “The Urgals were almost upon me. If I \\nhad waited, they would have chopped me into pieces!”\\nBrom stamped his \\nteeth vigorously on the pipe stem. “You didn’t have any idea what you were \\ndoing.”\\n“Then tell me,” \\nchallenged Eragon. “I’ve been searching for answers to this mystery, but I \\ncan’t make sense of it. What happened? How could I have possibly used magic? No \\none has ever instructed me in it or taught me spells.”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nflashed. “This isn’t something you should be taught—much less use!”\\n“Well, Ihave \\nused it, and I may need it to fight again. But I won’t be able to if you don’t \\nhelp me. What’s wrong? Is there some secret I’m not supposed to learn until I’m \\nold and wise? Or maybe you don’t know anything about magic!”\\n“Boy!” roared \\nBrom. “You demand answers with an insolence rarely seen. If you knew what you \\nasked for, you would not be so quick to inquire. Do not try me.” He paused, \\nthen relaxed into a kinder countenance. “The knowledge you ask for is more \\ncomplex than you understand.”\\nEragon rose \\nhotly in protest. “I feel as though I’ve been thrust into a world with strange \\nrules that no one will explain.”\\n“I understand,” \\nsaid Brom. He fiddled with a piece of grass. “It’s late and we should sleep, \\nbut I will tell you a few things now, to stop your badgering. This magic—for it \\nis magic—has rules like the rest of the world. If you break the rules, the \\npenalty is death, without exception. Your deeds are limited by your strength, \\nthe words you know, and your imagination.”\\n“What do you \\nmean by words?” asked Eragon.\\n“More \\nquestions!” cried Brom. “For a moment I had hoped you were empty of them. But \\nyou are quite right in asking. When you shot the Urgals, didn’t you say \\nsomething?”\\n“Yes,brisingr. \\n” The fire flared, and a shiver ran through Eragon. Something about the word \\nmade him feel incredibly alive.\\n“I thought so.Brisingr \\nis from an ancient language that all living things used to speak. However, it \\nwas forgotten over time and went unspoken for eons in Alagaësia, until the \\nelves brought it back over the sea. They taught it to the other races, who used \\nit for making and doing powerful things. The language has a name for \\neverything, if you can find it.”\\n“But what does \\nthat have to do with magic?” interrupted Eragon.\\n“Everything! It \\nis the basis for all power. The language describes the true nature of things, \\nnot the superficial aspects that everyone sees. For example, fire is calledbrisingr \\n. Not only is thata name for fire, it isthe name for fire. If you \\nare strong enough, you can usebrisingr to direct fire to do whatever you \\nwill. And that is what happened today.”\\nEragon thought \\nabout it for a moment. “Why was the fire blue? How come it did exactly what I \\nwanted, if all I said wasfire ?”\\n“The color \\nvaries from person to person. It depends on who says the word. As to why the \\nfire did what you wanted, that’s a matter of practice. Most beginners have to \\nspell out exactly what they want to happen. As they gain more experience, it \\nisn’t as necessary. A true master could just saywater and create \\nsomething totally unrelated, like a gemstone. You wouldn’t be able to understand \\nhow he had done it, but the master would have seen the connection betweenwater \\nand the gem and would have used that as the focal point for his power. The \\npractice is more of an art than anything else. What you did was extremely \\ndifficult.”\\nSaphira interrupted \\nEragon’s thoughts.Brom is a magician! That’s how he was able to light the \\nfire on the plains. He doesn’t just know about magic; he can use it himself!\\nEragon’s eyes \\nwidened.You’re right!\\nAsk him about \\nthis power, but be careful of what you say. It is unwise to trifle with those \\nwho have such abilities. If he is a wizard or sorcerer, who knows what his \\nmotives might have been for settling in Carvahall? \\nEragon kept that \\nin mind as he said carefully, “Saphira and I just realized something. You can \\nuse this magic, can’t you? That’s how you started the fire our first day on the \\nplains.”\\nBrom inclined \\nhis head slightly. “I am proficient to some degree.”\\n“Then why didn’t \\nyou fight the Urgals with it? In fact, I can think of many times when it would \\nhave been useful—you could have shielded us from the storm and kept the dirt \\nout of our eyes.”\\nAfter refilling \\nhis pipe, Brom said, “Some simple reasons, really. I am not a Rider, which \\nmeans that, even at your weakest moment, you are stronger than I. And I have outlived \\nmy youth; I’m not as strong as I used to be. Every time I reach for magic, it \\ngets a little harder.”\\nEragon dropped \\nhis eyes, abashed. “I’m sorry.”\\n“Don’t be,” said \\nBrom as he shifted his arm. “It happens to everyone.”\\n“Where did you \\nlearn to use magic?”\\n“That is one \\nfact I’ll keep to myself. . . . Suffice it to say, it was in a remote area and \\nfrom a very good teacher. I can, at the very least, pass on his lessons.” Brom \\nsnuffed his pipe with a small rock. “I know that you have more questions, and I \\nwill answer them, but they must wait until morning.”\\nHe leaned \\nforward, eyes gleaming. “Until then, I will say this to discourage any \\nexperiments: magic takes just as much energy as if you used your arms and back. \\nThat is why you felt tired after destroying the Urgals. And that is why I was \\nangry. It was a dreadful risk on your part. If the magic had used more energy \\nthan was in your body, it would have killed you. You should use magic only for \\ntasks that can’t be accomplished the mundane way.”\\n“How do you know \\nif a spell will use all your energy?” asked Eragon, frightened.\\nBrom raised his \\nhands. “Most of the time you don’t. That’s why magicians have to know their \\nlimits well, and even then they are cautious. Once you commit to a task and \\nrelease the magic, you can’t pull it back, even if it’s going to kill you. I \\nmean this as a warning: don’t try anything until you’ve learned more. Now, \\nenough of this for tonight.”\\nAs they spread \\nout their blankets, Saphira commented with satisfaction,We are becoming more \\npowerful, Eragon, both of us. Soon no one will be able to stand in our way.\\nYes, but which \\nway shall we choose?\\n\\nWhichever one we \\nwant,she \\nsaid smugly, settling down for the night.\\nM AGICIS THE \\nSIMPLESTTHING\\n“Why do you think \\nthose two Urgals were still in Yazuac?” asked Eragon, after they had been on \\nthe trail for a while. “There doesn’t seem to be any reason for them to have \\nstayed behind.”\\n“I suspect they \\ndeserted the main group to loot the town. What makes it odd is that, as far as \\nI know, Urgals have gathered in force only two or three times in history. It’s \\nunsettling that they are doing it now.”\\n“Do you think \\nthe Ra’zac caused the attack?”\\n“I don’t know. \\nThe best thing we can do is continue away from Yazuac at the fastest pace we \\ncan muster. Besides, this is the direction the Ra’zac went: south.”\\nEragon agreed. \\n“We still need provisions, however. Is there another town nearby?”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, but Saphira can hunt for us if we must survive on meat alone. This \\nswath of trees may look small to you, but there are plenty of animals in it. \\nThe river is the only source of water for many miles around, so most of the \\nplains animals come here to drink. We won’t starve.”\\nEragon remained \\nquiet, satisfied with Brom’s answer. As they rode, loud birds darted around \\nthem, and the river rushed by peacefully. It was a noisy place, full of life \\nand energy. Eragon asked, “How did that Urgal get you? Things were happening so \\nfast, I didn’t see.”\\n“Bad luck, \\nreally,” grumbled Brom. “I was more than a match for him, so he kicked \\nSnowfire. The idiot of a horse reared and threw me off balance. That was all \\nthe Urgal needed to give me this gash.” He scratched his chin. “I suppose \\nyou’re still wondering about this magic. The fact that you’ve discovered it \\npresents a thorny problem. Few know it, but every Rider could use magic, though \\nwith differing strengths. They kept the ability secret, even at the height of \\ntheir power, because it gave them an advantage over their enemies. Had everyone \\nknown about it, dealing with common people would have been difficult. Many \\nthink the king’s magical powers come from the fact that he is a wizard or \\nsorcerer. That’s not true; it is because he’s a Rider.”\\n“What’s the \\ndifference? Doesn’t the fact that I used magic make me a sorcerer?”\\n“Not at all! A \\nsorcerer, like a Shade, uses spirits to accomplish his will. That is totally \\ndifferent from your power. Nor does that make you a magician, whose powers come \\nwithout the aid of spirits or a dragon. And you’re certainly not a witch or \\nwizard, who get their powers from various potions and spells.\\n“Which brings me \\nback to my original point: the problem you’ve presented. Young Riders like \\nyourself were put through a strict regimen designed to strengthen their bodies \\nand increase their mental control. This regimen continued for many months, \\noccasionally years, until the Riders were deemed responsible enough to handle \\nmagic. Up until then, not one student was told of his potential powers. If one \\nof them discovered magic by accident, he or she was immediately taken away for \\nprivate tutoring. It was rare for anyone to discover magic on his own,” he \\ninclined his head toward Eragon, “though they were never put under the same \\npressure you were.”\\n“Then how were \\nthey finally trained to use magic?” asked Eragon. “I don’t see how you could \\nteach it to anyone. If you had tried to explain it to me two days ago, it \\nwouldn’t have made any sense.”\\n“The students \\nwere presented with a series of pointless exercises designed to frustrate them. \\nFor example, they were instructed to move piles of stones using only their \\nfeet, fill ever draining tubs full of water, and other impossibilities. After a \\ntime, they would get infuriated enough to use magic. Most of the time it \\nsucceeded.\\n“What this \\nmeans,” Brom continued, “is that you will be disadvantaged if you ever meet an \\nenemy who has received this training. There are still some alive who are that \\nold: the king for one, not to mention the elves. Any one of those could tear \\nyou apart with ease.”\\n“What can I do, \\nthen?”\\n“There isn’t \\ntime for formal instruction, but we can do much while we travel,” said Brom. “I \\nknow many techniques you can practice that will give you strength and control, \\nbut you cannot gain the discipline the Riders had overnight. You,” he looked at \\nEragon humorously, “will have to amass it on the run. It will be hard in the \\nbeginning, but the rewards will be great. It may please you to know that no \\nRider your age ever used magic the way you did yesterday with those two Urgals.”\\nEragon smiled at \\nthe praise. “Thank you. Does this language have a name?”\\nBrom laughed. \\n“Yes, but no one knows it. It would be a word of incredible power, something by \\nwhich you could control the entire language and those who use it. People have \\nlong searched for it, but no one has ever found it.”\\n“I still don’t \\nunderstand how this magic works,” said Eragon. “Exactly how do I use it?”\\nBrom looked \\nastonished. “I haven’t made that clear?”\\n“No.”\\nBrom took a deep \\nbreath and said, “To work with magic, you must have a certain innate power, \\nwhich is very rare among people nowadays. You also have to be able to summon \\nthis power at will. Once it is called upon, you have to use it or let it fade \\naway. Understood? Now, if you wish to employ the power, you must utter the word \\nor phrase of the ancient language that describes your intent. For example, if \\nyou hadn’t saidbrisingr yesterday, nothing would have happened.”\\n“So I’m limited \\nby my knowledge of this language?”\\n“Exactly,” \\ncrowed Brom. “Also, while speaking it, it’s impossible to practice deceit.”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “That can’t be. People always lie. The sounds of the ancient words can’t \\nstop them from doing that.”\\nBrom cocked an \\neyebrow and said, “Fethrblaka, eka weohnata néiat haina ono. Blaka eom iet \\nlam.” A bird suddenly flitted from a branch and landed on his hand. It trilled \\nlightly and looked at them with beady eyes. After a moment he said, “Eitha,” \\nand it fluttered away.\\n“How did you do \\nthat?” asked Eragon in wonder.\\n“I promised not \\nto harm him. He may not have known exactly what I meant, but in the language of \\npower, the meaning of my words was evident. The bird trusted me because he \\nknows what all animals do, that those who speak in that tongue are bound by \\ntheir word.”\\n“And the elves \\nspeak this language?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“So they never \\nlie?”\\n“Not quite,” \\nadmitted Brom. “They maintain that they don’t, and in a way it’s true, but they \\nhave perfected the art of saying one thing and meaning another. You never know \\nexactly what their intent is, or if you have fathomed it correctly. Many times \\nthey only reveal part of the truth and withhold the rest. It takes a refined \\nand subtle mind to deal with their culture.”\\nEragon \\nconsidered that. “What do personal names mean in this language? Do they give \\npower over people?”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nbrightened with approval. “Yes, they do. Those who speak the language have two \\nnames. The first is for everyday use and has little authority. But the second \\nis their true name and is shared with only a few trusted people. There was a time \\nwhen no one concealed his true name, but this age isn’t as kind. Whoever knows \\nyour true name gains enormous power over you. It’s like putting your life into \\nanother person’s hands. Everyone has a hidden name, but few know what it is.”\\n“How do you find \\nyour true name?” asked Eragon.\\n“Elves \\ninstinctively know theirs. No one else has that gift. The human Riders usually \\nwent on quests to discover it—or found an elf who would tell them, which was \\nrare, for elves don’t distribute that knowledge freely,” replied Brom.\\n“I’d like to \\nknow mine,” Eragon said wistfully.\\nBrom’s brow \\ndarkened. “Be careful. It can be a terrible knowledge. To know who you are \\nwithout any delusions or sympathy is a moment of revelation that no one \\nexperiences unscathed. Some have been driven to madness by that stark reality. \\nMost try to forget it. But as much as the name will give others power, so you \\nmay gain power over yourself, if the truth doesn’t break you.”\\nAnd I’m sure \\nthat it would not,stated \\nSaphira.\\n“I still wish to \\nknow,” said Eragon, determined.\\n“You are not \\neasily dissuaded. That is good, for only the resolute find their identity, but \\nI cannot help you with this. It is a search that you will have to undertake on \\nyour own.” Brom moved his injured arm and grimaced uncomfortably.\\n“Why can’t you \\nor I heal that with magic?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom blinked. \\n“No reason—I just never considered it because it’s beyond my strength. You \\ncould probably do it with the right word, but I don’t want you to exhaust \\nyourself.”\\n“I could save \\nyou a lot of trouble and pain,” protested Eragon.\\n“I’ll live with \\nit,” said Brom flatly. “Using magic to heal a wound takes just as much energy \\nas it would to mend on its own. I don’t want you tired for the next few days. \\nYou shouldn’t attempt such a difficult task yet.”\\n“Still, if it’s \\npossible to fix your arm, could I bring someone back from the dead?”\\nThe question \\nsurprised Brom, but he answered quickly, “Remember what I said about projects \\nthat will kill you? That is one of them. Riders were forbidden to try to resurrect \\nthe dead, for their own safety. There is an abyss beyond life where magic means \\nnothing. If you reach into it, your strength will flee and your soul will fade \\ninto darkness. Wizards, sorcerers, and Riders—all have failed and died on that \\nthreshold. Stick with what’s possible—cuts, bruises, maybe some broken \\nbones—but definitely not dead people.”\\nEragon frowned. \\n“This is a lot more complex than I thought.”\\n“Exactly!” said \\nBrom. “And if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you’ll try something too \\nbig and die.” He twisted in his saddle and swooped down, grabbing a handful of \\npebbles from the ground. With effort, he righted himself, then discarded all \\nbut one of the rocks. “See this pebble?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Take it.” \\nEragon did and stared at the unremarkable lump. It was dull black, smooth, and \\nas large as the end of his thumb. There were countless stones like it on the \\ntrail. “This is your training.”\\nEragon looked \\nback at him, confused. “I don’t understand.”\\n“Of course you \\ndon’t,” said Brom impatiently. “That’s why I’m teaching you and not the other \\nway around. Now stop talking or we’ll never get anywhere. What I want you to do \\nis lift the rock off your palm and hold it in the air for as long as you can. \\nThe words you’re going to use arestenr reisa . Say them.”\\n“Stenr reisa.”\\n“Good. Go ahead \\nand try.”\\nEragon focused \\nsourly on the pebble, searching his mind for any hint of the energy that had \\nburned in him the day before. The stone remained motionless as he stared at it, \\nsweating and frustrated.How am I supposed to do this? Finally, he \\ncrossed his arms and snapped, “This is impossible.”\\n“No,” said Brom \\ngruffly. “I’llsay when it’s impossible or not. Fight for it! Don’t give \\nin this easily. Try again.”\\nFrowning, Eragon \\nclosed his eyes, setting aside all distracting thoughts. He took a deep breath \\nand reached into the farthest corners of his consciousness, trying to find \\nwhere his power resided. Searching, he found only thoughts and memories until \\nhe felt something different—a small bump that was a part of him and yet not of \\nhim. Excited, he dug into it, seeking what it hid. He felt resistance, a \\nbarrier in his mind, but knew that the power lay on the other side. He tried to \\nbreach it, but it held firm before his efforts. Growing angry, Eragon drove \\ninto the barrier, ramming against it with all of his might until it shattered \\nlike a thin pane of glass, flooding his mind with a river of light.\\n“Stenr reisa,” \\nhe gasped. The pebble wobbled into the air over his faintly glowing palm. He \\nstruggled to keep it floating, but the power slipped away and faded back behind \\nthe barrier. The pebble dropped to his hand with a soft plop, and his palm \\nreturned to normal. He felt a little tired, but grinned from his success.\\n“Not bad for \\nyour first time,” said Brom.\\n“Why does my \\nhand do that? It’s like a little lantern.”\\n“No one’s sure,” \\nBrom admitted. “The Riders always preferred to channel their power through \\nwhichever hand bore the gedwëy ignasia. You can use your other palm, but it \\nisn’t as easy.” He looked at Eragon for a minute. “I’ll buy you some gloves at \\nthe next town, if it isn’t gutted. You hide the mark pretty well on your own, \\nbut we don’t want anyone to see it by accident. Besides, there may be times \\nwhen you won’t want the glow to alert an enemy.”\\n“Do you have a \\nmark of your own?”\\n“No. Only Riders \\nhave them,” said Brom. “Also, you should know that magic is affected by \\ndistance, just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move something a \\nmile away, it’ll take more energy than if you were closer. So if you see \\nenemies racing after you from a league away, let them approach before using \\nmagic. Now, back to work! Try to lift the pebble again.”\\n“Again?” asked \\nEragon weakly, thinking of the effort it had taken to do it just once.\\n“Yes! And this \\ntime be quicker about it.”\\nThey continued \\nwith the exercises throughout most of the day. When Eragon finally stopped, he \\nwas tired and ill-tempered. In those hours, he had come to hate the pebble and \\neverything about it. He started to throw it away, but Brom said, “Don’t. Keep \\nit.” Eragon glared at him, then reluctantly tucked the stone into a pocket.\\n“We’re not done \\nyet,” warned Brom, “so don’t get comfortable.” He pointed at a small plant. \\n“This is calleddelois .” From there on he instructed Eragon in the \\nancient language, giving him words to memorize, fromvöndr, a thin, \\nstraight stick, to the morning star,Aiedail .\\nThat evening \\nthey sparred around the fire. Though Brom fought with his left hand, his skill \\nwas undiminished.\\n\\xa0\\nThe days \\nfollowed the same pattern. First, Eragon struggled to learn the ancient words \\nand to manipulate the pebble. Then, in the evening, he trained against Brom \\nwith the fake swords. Eragon was in constant discomfort, but he gradually began \\nto change, almost without noticing. Soon the pebble no longer wobbled when he \\nlifted it. He mastered the first exercises Brom gave him and undertook harder \\nones, and his knowledge of the ancient language grew.\\nIn their \\nsparring, Eragon gained confidence and speed, striking like a snake. His blows \\nbecame heavier, and his arm no longer trembled when he warded off attacks. The \\nclashes lasted longer as he learned how to fend off Brom. Now, when they went \\nto sleep, Eragon was not the only one with bruises.\\nSaphira \\ncontinued to grow as well, but more slowly than before. Her extended flights, \\nalong with periodic hunts, kept her fit and healthy. She was taller than the \\nhorses now, and much longer. Because of her size and the way her scales \\nsparkled, she was altogether too visible. Brom and Eragon worried about it, but \\nthey could not convince her to allow dirt to obscure her scintillating hide.\\nThey continued \\nsouth, tracking the Ra’zac. It frustrated Eragon that no matter how fast they \\nwent, the Ra’zac always stayed a few days ahead of them. At times he was ready \\nto give up, but then they would find some mark or print that would renew his \\nhope.\\nThere were no \\nsigns of habitation along the Ninor or in the plains, leaving the three \\ncompanions undisturbed as the days slipped by. Finally, they neared Daret, the \\nfirst village since Yazuac.\\n\\xa0\\nThe night before \\nthey reached the village, Eragon’s dreams were especially vivid.\\nHe saw Garrow \\nand Roran at home, sitting in the destroyed kitchen. They asked him for help \\nrebuilding the farm, but he only shook his head with a pang of longing in his \\nheart. “I’m tracking your killers,” he whispered to his uncle. \\nGarrow looked at \\nhim askance and demanded, “Do I look dead to you?” \\n“I can’t help \\nyou,” said Eragon softly, feeling tears in his eyes. \\nThere was a \\nsudden roar, and Garrow transformed into the Ra’zac. “Then die,” they hissed, \\nand leapt at Eragon.\\n\\nHe woke up \\nfeeling ill and watched the stars slowly turn in the sky.\\nAll will be \\nwell, little one,said \\nSaphira gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD ARET \\nDaret was on the \\nbanks of the Ninor River—as it had to be to survive. The village was small and \\nwild-looking, without any signs of inhabitants. Eragon and Brom approached it \\nwith great caution. Saphira hid close to the town this time; if trouble arose, \\nshe would be at their sides within seconds.\\nThey rode into \\nDaret, striving to be silent. Brom gripped his sword with his good hand, eyes \\nflashing everywhere. Eragon kept his bow partially drawn as they passed between \\nthe silent houses, glancing at each other with apprehension.This doesn’t \\nlook good, commented Eragon to Saphira. She did not answer, but he felt her \\nprepare to rush after them. He looked at the ground and was reassured to see \\nthe fresh footprints of children.But where are they?\\nBrom stiffened \\nas they entered the center of Daret and found it empty. Wind blew through the \\ndesolate town, and dust devils swirled sporadically. Brom wheeled Snowfire \\nabout. “Let’s get out of here. I don’t like the feel of this.” He spurred \\nSnowfire into a gallop. Eragon followed him, urging Cadoc onward.\\nThey advanced \\nonly a few strides before wagons toppled out from behind the houses and blocked \\ntheir way. Cadoc snorted and dug in his hooves, sliding to a stop next to \\nSnowfire. A swarthy man hopped over the wagon and planted himself before them, \\na broadsword slung at his side and a drawn bow in his hands. Eragon swung his \\nown bow up and pointed it at the stranger, who commanded, “Halt! Put your \\nweapons down. You’re surrounded by sixty archers. They’ll shoot if you move.” \\nAs if on cue, a row of men stood up on the roofs of the surrounding houses.\\nStay away, \\nSaphira!cried \\nEragon.There are too many. If you come, they’ll shoot you out of the sky. \\nStay away! She heard, but he was unsure if she would obey. He prepared to \\nuse magic.I’ll have to stop the arrows before they hit me or Brom.\\n“What do you \\nwant?” asked Brom calmly.\\n“Why have you \\ncome here?” demanded the man.\\n“To buy supplies \\nand hear the news. Nothing more. We’re on the way to my cousin’s house in \\nDras-Leona.”\\n“You’re armed \\npretty heavily.”\\n“So are you,” \\nsaid Brom. “These are dangerous times.”\\n“True.” The man \\nlooked at them carefully. “I don’t think you mean us ill, but we’ve had too \\nmany encounters with Urgals and bandits for me to trust you only on your word.”\\n“If it doesn’t \\nmatter what we say, what happens now?” countered Brom. The men on top of the \\nhouses had not moved. By their very stillness, Eragon was sure that they were \\neither highly disciplined . . . or frightened for their lives. He hoped it was \\nthe latter.\\n“You say that \\nyou only want supplies. Would you agree to stay here while we bring what you \\nneed, then pay us and leave immediately?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid the man, lowering his bow, though he kept it ready. He waved at one of the \\narchers, who slid to the ground and ran over. “Tell him what you want.”\\nBrom recited a \\nshort list and then added, “Also, if you have a spare pair of gloves that would \\nfit my nephew, I’d like to buy those too.” The archer nodded and ran off.\\n“The name’s \\nTrevor,” said the man standing in front of them. “Normally I’d shake your hand, \\nbut under the circumstances, I think I’ll keep my distance. Tell me, where are \\nyou from?”\\n“North,” said \\nBrom, “but we haven’t lived in any place long enough to call it home. Have \\nUrgals forced you to take these measures?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nTrevor, “and worse fiends. Do you have any news from other towns? We receive \\nword from them rarely, but there have been reports that they are also \\nbeleaguered.”\\nBrom turned \\ngrave. “I wish it wasn’t our lot to bring you these tidings. Nearly a fortnight \\nago we passed through Yazuac and found it pillaged. The villagers had been \\nslaughtered and piled together. We would have tried to give them a decent \\nburial, but two Urgals attacked us.”\\nShocked, Trevor \\nstepped back and looked down with tears in his eyes. “Alas, this is indeed a \\ndark day. Still, I don’t see how two Urgals could have defeated all of Yazuac. \\nThe people there were good fighters—some were my friends.”\\n“There were \\nsigns that a band of Urgals had ravaged the town,” stated Brom. “I think the \\nones we encountered were deserters.”\\n“How large was \\nthe company?”\\nBrom fiddled \\nwith his saddlebags for a minute. “Large enough to wipe out Yazuac, but small \\nenough to go unnoticed in the countryside. No more than a hundred, and no less \\nthan fifty. If I’m not mistaken, either number would prove fatal to you.” \\nTrevor wearily agreed. “You should consider leaving,” Brom continued. “This \\narea has become far too perilous for anyone to live in peace.”\\n“I know, but the \\npeople here refuse to consider moving. This is their home—as well as mine, \\nthough I have only been here a couple years—and they place its worth above \\ntheir own lives.” Trevor looked at him seriously. “We have repulsed individual \\nUrgals, and that has given the townspeople a confidence far beyond their \\nabilities. I fear that we will all wake up one morning with our throats \\nslashed.”\\nThe archer \\nhurried out of a house with a pile of goods in his arms. He set them next to \\nthe horses, and Brom paid him. As the man left, Brom asked, “Why did they \\nchoose you to defend Daret?”\\nTrevor shrugged. \\n“I was in the king’s army for some years.”\\nBrom dug through \\nthe items, handed Eragon the pair of gloves, and packed the rest of the \\nsupplies into their saddlebags. Eragon pulled the gloves on, being careful to \\nkeep his palm facing down, and flexed his hands. The leather felt good and \\nstrong, though it was scarred from use. “Well,” said Brom, “as I promised, we \\nwill go now.”\\nTrevor nodded. \\n“When you enter Dras-Leona, would you do us this favor? Alert the Empire to our \\nplight and that of the other towns. If word of this hasn’t reached the king by \\nnow, it’s cause for worry. And if it has, but he has chosen to do nothing, that \\ntoo is cause for worry.”\\n“We will carry \\nyour message. May your swords stay sharp,” said Brom.\\n“And yours.”\\nThe wagons were \\npulled out of their way, and they rode from Daret into the trees along the \\nNinor River. Eragon sent his thoughts to Saphira.We’re on our way back. \\nEverything turned out all right. Her only response was simmering anger.\\nBrom pulled at \\nhis beard. “The Empire is in worse condition than I had imagined. When the \\ntraders visited Carvahall, they brought reports of unrest, but I never believed \\nthat it was this widespread. With all these Urgals around, it seems that the \\nEmpire itself is under attack, yet no troops or soldiers have been sent out. \\nIt’s as if the king doesn’t care to defend his domain.”\\n“It is strange,” \\nagreed Eragon.\\nBrom ducked \\nunder a low-hanging branch. “Did you use any of your powers while we were in \\nDaret?”\\n“There was no \\nreason to.”\\n“Wrong,” \\ncorrected Brom. “You could have sensed Trevor’s intentions. Even with my \\nlimited abilities, I was able to do that. If the villagers had been bent on \\nkilling us, I wouldn’t have just sat there. However, I felt there was a \\nreasonable chance of talking our way out of there, which is what I did.”\\n“How could I \\nknow what Trevor was thinking?” asked Eragon. “Am I supposed to be able to see \\ninto people’s minds?”\\n“Come now,” \\nchided Brom, “you should know the answer to that. You could have discovered \\nTrevor’s purpose in the same way that you communicate with Cadoc or Saphira. \\nThe minds of men are not so different from a dragon’s or horse’s. It’s a simple \\nthing to do, but it’s a power you must use sparingly and with great caution. A \\nperson’s mind is his last sanctuary. You must never violate it unless \\ncircumstances force you to. The Riders had very strict rules regarding this. If \\nthey were broken without due cause, the punishment was severe.”\\n“And you can do \\nthis even though you aren’t a Rider?” asked Eragon.\\n“As I said \\nbefore, with the right instruction anyone can talk with their minds, but with \\ndiffering amounts of success. Whether it’s magic, though, is hard to tell. \\nMagical abilities will certainly trigger the talent—or becoming linked with a \\ndragon—but I’ve known plenty who learned it on their own. Think about it: you \\ncan communicate with any sentient being, though the contact may not be very \\nclear. You could spend the entire day listening to a bird’s thoughts or \\nunderstanding how an earthworm feels during a rainstorm. But I’ve never found \\nbirds very interesting. I suggest starting with a cat; they have unusual \\npersonalities.”\\nEragon twisted \\nCadoc’s reins in his hands, considering the implications of what Brom had said. \\n“But if I can get into someone’s head, doesn’t that mean that others can do the \\nsame to me? How do I know if someone’s prying in my mind? Is there a way to \\nstop that?”How do I know if Brom can tell what I’m thinking right now?\\n“Why, yes. \\nHasn’t Saphira ever blocked you from her mind?”\\n“Occasionally,” \\nadmitted Eragon. “When she took me into the Spine, I couldn’t talk to her at \\nall. It wasn’t that she was ignoring me; I don’t think she could even hear me. \\nThere were walls around her mind that I couldn’t get through.”\\nBrom worked on \\nhis bandage for a moment, shifting it higher on his arm. “Only a few people can \\ntell if someone is in their mind, and of those, only a handful could stop you \\nfrom entering. It’s a matter of training and of how you think. Because of your \\nmagical power, you’ll always know if someone is in your mind. Once you do, \\nblocking them is a simple matter of concentrating on one thing to the exclusion \\nof all else. For instance, if you only think about a brick wall, that’s all the \\nenemy will find in your mind. However, it takes a huge amount of energy and \\ndiscipline to block someone for any length of time. If you’re distracted by \\neven the slightest thing, your wall will waver and your opponent will slip in \\nthrough the weakness.”\\n“How can I learn \\nto do this?” asked Eragon.\\n“There is only \\none thing for it: practice, practice, and yet more practice. Picture something \\nin your mind and hold it there to the exclusion of all else for as long as you \\ncan. It is a very advanced ability; only a handful ever master it,” said Brom.\\n“I don’t need \\nperfection, just safety.”If I can get into someone’s mind, can I change how \\nhe thinks? Every time I learn something new about magic, I grow more wary of \\nit.\\nWhen they \\nreached Saphira, she startled them by thrusting her head at them. The horses \\nbackstepped nervously. Saphira looked Eragon over carefully and gave a low \\nhiss. Her eyes were flinty. Eragon threw a concerned look at Brom—he had never \\nseen Saphira this angry—then asked,What’s wrong?\\nYou,she growled.You \\nare the problem.\\nEragon frowned \\nand got off Cadoc. As soon as his feet touched the ground, Saphira swept his \\nlegs out from under him with her tail and pinned him with her talons. “What are \\nyou doing?” he yelled, struggling to get up, but she was too strong for him. \\nBrom watched attentively from Snowfire.\\nSaphira swung \\nher head over Eragon until they were eye to eye. He squirmed under her \\nunwavering glare.You! Every time you leave my sight you get into trouble. \\nYou’re like a new hatchling, sticking your nose into everything. And what happens \\nwhen you stick it into something that bites back? How will you survive then? I \\ncannot help you when I’m miles away. I’ve stayed hidden so that no one would \\nsee me, but no longer! Not when it may cost you your life.\\nI can understand \\nwhy you’re upset,said \\nEragon,but I’m much older than you and can take care of myself. If anything, \\nyou’re the one who needs to be protected.\\nShe snarled and \\nsnapped her teeth by his ear.Do you really believe that? she asked.Tomorrow \\nyou will ride me—not that pitiful deer-animal you call a horse—or else I will \\ncarry you in my claws. Are you a Dragon Rider or not? Don’t you care for me?\\nThe question \\nburned in Eragon, and he dropped his gaze. He knew she was right, but he was \\nscared of riding her. Their flights had been the most painful ordeal he had \\never endured.\\n“Well?” demanded \\nBrom.\\n“She wants me to \\nride her tomorrow,” said Eragon lamely.\\nBrom considered \\nit with twinkling eyes. “Well, you have the saddle. I suppose that if the two \\nof you stay out of sight, it won’t be a problem.” Saphira switched her gaze to \\nhim, then returned it to Eragon.\\n“But what if \\nyou’re attacked or there’s an accident? I won’t be able to get there in time \\nand—”\\nSaphira pressed \\nharder on his chest, stopping his words.Exactly my point, little one.\\nBrom seemed to \\nhide a smile. “It’s worth the risk. You need to learn how to ride her anyway. \\nThink about it this way: with you flying ahead and looking at the ground, \\nyou’ll be able to spot any traps, ambushes, or other unwelcome surprises.”\\nEragon looked \\nback at Saphira and said,Okay, I’ll do it. But let me up.\\nGive me your \\nword.\\n\\nIs that really \\nnecessary?he \\ndemanded. She blinked.Very well. I give you my word that I will fly with you \\ntomorrow. Satisfied?\\nI am content. \\nSaphira let him \\nup and, with a push of her legs, took off. A small shiver ran through Eragon as \\nhe watched her twist through the air. Grumbling, he returned to Cadoc and \\nfollowed Brom.\\nIt was nearly \\nsundown when they made camp. As usual, Eragon dueled with Brom before dinner. \\nIn the midst of the fight, Eragon delivered such a powerful blow that he \\nsnapped both of their sticks like twigs. The pieces whistled into the darkness \\nin a cloud of splintered fragments. Brom tossed what remained of his stick into \\nthe fire and said, “We’re done with these; throw yours in as well. You have \\nlearned well, but we’ve gone as far as we can with branches. There is nothing \\nmore you can gain from them. It is time for you to use the blade.” He removed \\nZar’roc from Eragon’s bag and gave it to him.\\n“We’ll cut each \\nother to ribbons,” protested Eragon.\\n“Not so. Again \\nyou forget magic,” said Brom. He held up his sword and turned it so that \\nfirelight glinted off the edge. He put a finger on either side of the blade and \\nfocused intensely, deepening the lines on his forehead. For a moment nothing \\nhappened, then he uttered, “Gëuloth du knífr!” and a small red spark jumped \\nbetween his fingers. As it flickered back and forth, he ran his fingers down \\nthe length of the sword. Then he twirled it and did the same thing on the other \\nside. The spark vanished the moment his fingers left the metal.\\nBrom held his \\nhand out, palm up, and slashed it with the sword. Eragon jumped forward but was \\ntoo slow to stop him. He was astonished when Brom raised his unharmed hand with \\na smile. “What did you do?” asked Eragon.\\n“Feel the edge,” \\nsaid Brom. Eragon touched it and felt an invisible surface under his fingers. \\nThe barrier was about a quarter inch wide and very slippery. “Now do the same \\non Zar’roc,” instructed Brom. “Your block will be a bit different than mine, \\nbut it should accomplish the same thing.”\\nHe told Eragon \\nhow to pronounce the words and coached him through the process. It took Eragon \\na few tries, but he soon had Zar’roc’s edge protected. Confident, he took his \\nfighting stance. Before they started, Brom admonished, “These swords won’t cut \\nus, but they can still break bones. I would prefer to avoid that, so don’t \\nflail around like you normally do. A blow to the neck could prove fatal.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nthen struck without warning. Sparks flew off his blade, and the clash of metal \\nfilled their campsite as Brom parried. The sword felt slow and heavy to Eragon \\nafter fighting with sticks for so long. Unable to move Zar’roc fast enough, he \\nreceived a sharp rap on his knee.\\nThey both had \\nlarge welts when they stopped, Eragon more so than Brom. He marveled that \\nZar’roc had not been scratched or dented by the vigorous pounding it had \\nreceived.\\nT HROUGH \\nA  \\nDRAGON’SEYE\\nThe next morning \\nEragon woke with stiff limbs and purple bruises. He saw Brom carry the saddle \\nto Saphira and tried to quell his uneasiness. By the time breakfast was ready, \\nBrom had strapped the saddle onto Saphira and hung Eragon’s bags from it.\\nWhen his bowl \\nwas empty, Eragon silently picked up his bow and went to Saphira. Brom said, \\n“Now remember, grip with your knees, guide her with your thoughts, and stay as \\nflat as you can on her back. Nothing will go wrong if you don’t panic.” Eragon \\nnodded, sliding his unstrung bow into its leather tube, and Brom boosted him \\ninto the saddle.\\nSaphira waited \\nimpatiently while Eragon tightened the bands around his legs.Are you ready? \\nshe asked.\\nHe sucked in the \\nfresh morning air.No, but let’s do it! She agreed enthusiastically. He \\nbraced himself as she crouched. Her powerful legs surged and the air whipped \\npast him, snatching his breath away. With three smooth strokes of her wings, \\nshe was in the sky, climbing rapidly.\\nThe last time \\nEragon had ridden Saphira, every flap of her wings had been strained. Now she \\nflew steadily and effortlessly. He clenched his arms around her neck as she \\nturned on edge, banking. The river shrank to a wispy gray line beneath them. \\nClouds floated around them.\\nWhen they \\nleveled off high above the plains, the trees below were no more than specks. \\nThe air was thin, chilly, and perfectly clear. “This is wonderfu—” His words \\nwere lost as Saphira tilted and rolled completely around. The ground spun in a \\ndizzying circle, and vertigo clutched Eragon. “Don’t do that!” he cried. “I \\nfeel like I’m going to fall off.”\\nYou must become \\naccustomed to it. If I’m attacked in the air, that’s one of the simplest \\nmaneuvers I will do,she \\nreplied. He could think of no rebuttal, so he concentrated on controlling his \\nstomach. Saphira angled into a shallow dive and slowly approached the ground.\\nAlthough \\nEragon’s stomach lurched with every wobble, he began to enjoy himself. He \\nrelaxed his arms a bit and stretched his neck back, taking in the scenery. \\nSaphira let him enjoy the sights awhile, then said,Let me show you what \\nflying is really like.\\nHow?he asked.\\nRelax and do not \\nbe afraid,she \\nsaid.\\nHer mind tugged \\nat his, pulling him away from his body. Eragon fought for a moment, then \\nsurrendered control. His vision blurred, and he found himself looking through \\nSaphira’s eyes. Everything was distorted: colors had weird, exotic tints; blues \\nwere more prominent now, while greens and reds were subdued. Eragon tried to \\nturn his head and body but could not. He felt like a ghost who had slipped out \\nof the ether.\\nPure joy \\nradiated from Saphira as she climbed into the sky. She loved this freedom to go \\nanywhere. When they were high above the ground, she looked back at Eragon. He \\nsaw himself as she did, hanging on to her with a blank look. He could feel her \\nbody strain against the air, using updrafts to rise. All her muscles were like \\nhis own. He felt her tail swinging through the air like a giant rudder to \\ncorrect her course. It surprised him how much she depended on it.\\nTheir connection \\ngrew stronger until there was no distinction between their identities. They \\nclasped their wings together and dived straight down, like a spear thrown from \\non high. No terror of falling touched Eragon, engulfed as he was in Saphira’s \\nexhilaration. The air rushed past their face. Their tail whipped in the air, \\nand their joined minds reveled in the experience.\\nEven as they \\nplummeted toward the ground, there was no fear of collision. They snapped open \\ntheir wings at just the right moment, pulling out of the dive with their \\ncombined strength. Slanting toward the sky, they shot up and continued back \\nover into a giant loop.\\nAs they leveled \\nout, their minds began to diverge, becoming distinct personalities again. For a \\nsplit second, Eragon felt both his body and Saphira’s. Then his vision blurred \\nand he again sat on her back. He gasped and collapsed on the saddle. It was \\nminutes before his heart stopped hammering and his breathing calmed. Once he \\nhad recovered, he exclaimed,That was incredible! How can you bear to land \\nwhen you enjoy flying so much?\\nI must eat,she said with \\nsome amusement.But I am glad that you took pleasure in it.\\nThose are spare \\nwords for such an experience. I’m sorry I haven’t flown with you more; I never \\nthought it could be like that. Do you always see so much blue? \\nIt is the way I \\nam. We will fly together more often now? \\nYes! Every \\nchance we get.\\n\\nGood,she replied in a \\ncontented tone.\\nThey exchanged \\nmany thoughts as she flew, talking as they had not for weeks. Saphira showed \\nEragon how she used hills and trees to hide and how she could conceal herself \\nin the shadow of a cloud. They scouted the trail for Brom, which proved to be \\nmore arduous than Eragon expected. They could not see the path unless Saphira \\nflew very close to it, in which case she risked being detected.\\nNear midday, an \\nannoying buzz filled Eragon’s ears, and he became aware of a strange pressure \\non his mind. He shook his head, trying to get rid of it, but the tension only \\ngrew stronger. Brom’s words about how people could break into others’ minds \\nflashed through Eragon’s head, and he frantically tried to clear his thoughts. \\nHe concentrated on one of Saphira’s scales and forced himself to ignore \\neverything else. The pressure faded for a moment and then returned, greater \\nthan ever. A sudden gust rocked Saphira, and Eragon’s concentration slipped. \\nBefore he could marshal any defenses, the force broke through. But instead of \\nthe invasive presence of another mind, there were only the words,What do you \\nthink you’re doing? Get down here. I found something important.\\nBrom?queried Eragon.\\nYes,the old man said \\nirritably.Now get that oversized lizard of yours to land. I’m here. . . . \\nHe sent a picture of his location. Eragon quickly told Saphira where to go, and \\nshe banked toward the river below. Meanwhile, he strung his bow and drew \\nseveral arrows.\\nIf there’s \\ntrouble, I’ll be ready for it. \\nAs will I,said Saphira.\\nWhen they \\nreached Brom, Eragon saw him standing in a clearing, waving his arms. Saphira \\nlanded, and Eragon jumped off her and looked for danger. The horses were tied \\nto a tree on the edge of the clearing, but otherwise Brom was alone. Eragon \\ntrotted over and asked, “What’s wrong?”\\nBrom scratched \\nhis chin and muttered a string of curses. “Don’t ever block me out like that \\nagain. It’s hard enough for me to reach you without having to fight to make \\nmyself heard.”\\n“Sorry.”\\nHe snorted. “I \\nwas farther down the river when I noticed that the Ra’zac’s tracks had ceased. \\nI backtracked until I found where they had disappeared. Look at the ground and \\ntell me what you see.”\\nEragon knelt and \\nexamined the dirt and found a confusion of impressions that were difficult to \\ndecipher. Numerous Ra’zac footprints overlapped each other. Eragon guessed that \\nthe tracks were only a few days old. Superimposed over them were long, thick \\ngouges torn into the ground. They looked familiar, but Eragon could not say \\nwhy.\\nHe stood, \\nshaking his head. “I don’t have any idea what . . .” Then his eyes fell on \\nSaphira and he realized what had made the gouges. Every time she took off, her \\nback claws dug into the ground and ripped it in the same manner. “This doesn’t \\nmake any sense, but the only thing I can think of is that the Ra’zac flew off \\non dragons. Or else they got onto giant birds and disappeared into the heavens. \\nTell me you have a better explanation.”\\nBrom shrugged. “I’ve \\nheard reports of the Ra’zac moving from place to place with incredible speed, \\nbut this is the first evidence I’ve had of it. It will be almost impossible to \\nfind them if they have flying steeds. They aren’t dragons—I know that much. A \\ndragon would never consent to bear a Ra’zac.”\\n“What do we do? \\nSaphira can’t track them through the sky. Even if she could, we would leave you \\nfar behind.”\\n“There’s no easy \\nsolution to this riddle,” said Brom. “Let’s have lunch while we think on it. \\nPerhaps inspiration will strike us while we eat.” Eragon glumly went to his \\nbags for food. They ate in silence, staring at the empty sky.\\nOnce again \\nEragon thought of home and wondered what Roran was doing. A vision of the burnt \\nfarm appeared before him and grief threatened to overwhelm him.What will I \\ndo if we can’t find the Ra’zac? What is my purpose then? I could return to \\nCarvahall— he plucked a twig from the ground and snapped it between two \\nfingers—or just travel with Brom and continue my training.Eragon stared \\nout at the plains, hoping to quiet his thoughts.\\nWhen Brom \\nfinished eating, he stood and threw back his hood. “I have considered every \\ntrick I know, every word of power within my grasp, and all the skills we have, \\nbut I still don’t see how we can find the Ra’zac.” Eragon slumped against \\nSaphira in despair. “Saphira could show herself at some town. That would draw \\nthe Ra’zac like flies to honey. But it would be an extremely risky thing to \\nattempt. The Ra’zac would bring soldiers with them, and the king might be \\ninterested enough to come himself, which would spell certain death for you and \\nme.”\\n“So what now?” \\nasked Eragon, throwing his hands up.Do you have any ideas, Saphira?\\nNo. \\n“That’s up to \\nyou,” said Brom. “This is your crusade.”\\nEragon ground \\nhis teeth angrily and stalked away from Brom and Saphira. Just as he was about \\nto enter the trees, his foot struck something hard. Lying on the ground was a \\nmetal flask with a leather strap just long enough to hang off someone’s \\nshoulder. A silver insignia Eragon recognized as the Ra’zac’s symbol was \\nwrought into it.\\nExcited, he \\npicked up the flask and unscrewed its cap. A cloying smell filled the air—the \\nsame one he had noticed when he found Garrow in the wreckage of their house. He \\ntilted the flask, and a drop of clear, shiny liquid fell on his finger. \\nInstantly Eragon’s finger burned as if it were on fire. He yelped and scrubbed \\nhis hand on the ground. After a moment the pain subsided to a dull throbbing. A \\npatch of skin had been eaten away.\\nGrimacing, he \\njogged back to Brom. “Look what I found.” Brom took the flask and examined it, \\nthen poured a bit of the liquid into the cap. Eragon started to warn him, \\n“Watch out, it’ll burn—”\\n“My skin, I \\nknow,” said Brom. “And I suppose you went ahead and poured it all over your \\nhand. Your finger? Well, at least you showed sense enough not to drink it. Only \\na puddle would have been left of you.”\\n“What is it?” \\nasked Eragon.\\n“Oil from the \\npetals of the Seithr plant, which grows on a small island in the frigid \\nnorthern seas. In its natural state, the oil is used for preserving pearls—it \\nmakes them lustrous and strong. But when specific words are spoken over the \\noil, along with a blood sacrifice, it gains the property to eat any flesh. That \\nalone wouldn’t make it special—there are plenty of acids that can dissolve \\nsinew and bone—except for the fact that it leaves everything else untouched. \\nYou can dip anything into the oil and pull it out unharmed, unless it was once \\npart of an animal or human. This has made it a weapon of choice for torture and \\nassassination. It can be stored in wood, slathered on the point of a spear, or \\ndripped onto sheets so that the next person to touch them will be burned. There \\nare myriad uses for it, limited only by your ingenuity. Any injury caused by it \\nis always slow to heal. It’s rather rare and expensive, especially this \\nconverted form.”\\nEragon \\nremembered the terrible burns that had covered Garrow.That’s what they used \\non him, he realized with horror. “I wonder why the Ra’zac left it behind if \\nit’s so valuable.”\\n“It must have \\nslipped off when they flew away.”\\n“But why didn’t \\nthey come back for it? I doubt that the king will be pleased that they lost \\nit.”\\n“No, he won’t,” \\nsaid Brom, “but he would be even more displeased if they delayed bringing him \\nnews of you. In fact, if the Ra’zac have reached him by now, you can be sure \\nthat the king has learned your name. And that means we will have to be much \\nmore careful when we go into towns. There will be notices and alerts about you \\nposted throughout the Empire.”\\nEragon paused to \\nthink. “This oil, how rare is it exactly?”\\n“Like diamonds \\nin a pig trough,” said Brom. He amended himself after a second, “Actually, the \\nnormal oil is used by jewelers, but only those who can afford it.”\\n“So there are \\npeople who trade in it?”\\n“Perhaps one, \\nmaybe two.”\\n“Good,” said \\nEragon. “Now, do the cities along the coast keep shipping records?”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nbrightened. “Of course they do. If we could get to those records, they would \\ntell us who brought the oil south and where it went from there.”\\n“And the record \\nof the Empire’s purchase will tell us where the Ra’zac live!” concluded Eragon. \\n“I don’t know how many people can afford this oil, but it shouldn’t be hard to \\nfigure out which ones aren’t working for the Empire.”\\n“Genius!” \\nexclaimed Brom, smiling. “I wish I had thought of this years ago; it would have \\nsaved me many headaches. The coast is dotted with numerous cities and towns \\nwhere ships can land. I suppose that Teirm would be the place to start, as it \\ncontrols most of the trade.” Brom paused. “The last I heard, my old friend Jeod \\nlives there. We haven’t seen each other for many years, but he might be willing \\nto help us. And because he’s a merchant, it’s possible that he has access to \\nthose records.”\\n“How do we get \\nto Teirm?”\\n“We’ll have to \\ngo southwest until we reach a high pass in the Spine. Once on the other side, \\nwe can head up the coast to Teirm,” said Brom. A gentle wind pulled at his \\nhair.\\n“Can we reach \\nthe pass within a week?”\\n“Easily. If we \\nangle away from the Ninor and to our right, we might be able to see the \\nmountains by tomorrow.”\\nEragon went to \\nSaphira and mounted her. “I’ll see you at dinner, then.” When they were at a \\ngood height, he said,I’m going to ride Cadoc tomorrow. Before you protest, know \\nthat I am only doing it because I want to talk with Brom.\\nYou should ride \\nwith him every other day. That way you can still receive your instruction, and \\nI will have time to hunt. \\nYou won’t be \\ntroubled by it?\\n\\nIt is necessary. \\nWhen they landed \\nfor the day, he was pleased to discover that his legs did not hurt. The saddle \\nhad protected him well from Saphira’s scales.\\nEragon and Brom \\nhad their nightly fight, but it lacked energy, as both were preoccupied with \\nthe day’s events. By the time they finished, Eragon’s arms burned from \\nZar’roc’s unaccustomed weight.\\nAS ONG FOR THEROAD\\nThe next day \\nwhile they were riding, Eragon asked Brom, “What is the sea like?”\\n“You must have \\nheard it described before,” said Brom.\\n“Yes, but what \\nis it really like?”\\nBrom’s eyes grew \\nhazy, as if he looked upon some hidden scene. “The sea is emotion incarnate. It \\nloves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and \\nrejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that \\nwhich you can’t. Do you remember what I told you about how the elves came over \\nthe sea?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Though they \\nlive far from the coast, they retain a great fascination and passion for the \\nocean. The sound of crashing waves, the smell of salt air, it affects them \\ndeeply and has inspired many of their loveliest songs. There is one that tells \\nof this love, if you want to hear it.”\\n“I would,” said \\nEragon, interested.\\nBrom cleared his \\nthroat and said, “I will translate it from the ancient language as best I can. \\nIt won’t be perfect, but perhaps it will give you an idea of how the original \\nsounds.” He pulled Snowfire to a stop and closed his eyes. He was silent for a \\nwhile, then chanted softly:\\n\\xa0\\nO liquid \\ntemptress ’neath the azure sky, \\nYour gilded expanse \\ncalls me, calls me.\\n\\nFor I would sail \\never on,\\n\\nWere it not for \\nthe elven maid,\\n\\nWho calls me, \\ncalls me.\\n\\nShe binds my \\nheart with a lily-white tie, \\nNever to be \\nbroken, save by the sea, \\nEver to be torn \\ntwixt the trees and the waves. \\n\\xa0\\nThe words echoed \\nhauntingly in Eragon’s head. “There is much more to that song, the ‘Du Silbena \\nDatia.’ I have only recited one of its verses. It tells the sad tale of two \\nlovers, Acallamh and Nuada, who were separated by longing for the sea. The \\nelves find great meaning in the story.”\\n“It’s \\nbeautiful,” said Eragon simply.\\nThe Spine was a \\nfaint outline on the horizon when they halted that evening.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen they \\narrived at the Spine’s foothills, they turned and followed the mountains south. \\nEragon was glad to be near the mountains again; they placed comforting \\nboundaries on the world. Three days later they came to a wide road rutted by \\nwagon wheels. “This is the main road between the capital, Urû’baen, and Teirm,” \\nsaid Brom. “It’s widely used and a favorite route for merchants. We have to be \\nmore cautious. This isn’t the busiest time of year, but a few people are bound \\nto be using the road.”\\nDays passed \\nquickly as they continued to trek along the Spine, searching for the mountain \\npass. Eragon could not complain of boredom. When not learning the elven \\nlanguage, he was either learning how to care for Saphira or practicing magic. \\nEragon also learned how to kill game with magic, which saved them time hunting. \\nHe would hold a small rock on his hand and shoot it at his prey. It was \\nimpossible to miss. The results of his efforts roasted over the fire each \\nnight. And after dinner, Brom and Eragon would spar with swords and, \\noccasionally, fists.\\nThe long days \\nand strenuous work stripped Eragon’s body of excess fat. His arms became \\ncorded, and his tanned skin rippled with lean muscles.Everything about me is \\nturning hard, he thought dryly.\\nWhen they \\nfinally reached the pass, Eragon saw that a river rushed out of it and cut \\nacross the road. “This is the Toark,” explained Brom. “We’ll follow it all the \\nway to the sea.”\\n“How can we,” \\nlaughed Eragon, “if it flows out of the Spine inthis direction? It won’t \\nend up in the ocean unless it doubles back on itself.”\\nBrom twisted the \\nring on his finger. “Because in the middle of the mountains rests the Woadark \\nLake. A river flows from each end of it and both are called the Toark. We see \\nthe eastward one now. It runs to the south and winds through the brush until it \\njoins Leona Lake. The other one goes to the sea.”\\nAfter two days \\nin the Spine, they came upon a rock ledge from which they could see clearly out \\nof the mountains. Eragon noticed how the land flattened in the distance, and he \\ngroaned at the leagues they still had to traverse. Brom pointed. “Down there \\nand to the north lies Teirm. It is an old city. Some say it’s where the elves \\nfirst landed in Alagaësia. Its citadel has never fallen, nor have its warriors \\never been defeated.” He spurred Snowfire forward and left the ledge.\\n\\xa0\\nIt took them \\nuntil noon the next day to descend through the foothills and arrive at the \\nother side of the Spine, where the forested land quickly leveled out. Without \\nthe mountains to hide behind, Saphira flew close to the ground, using every \\nhollow and dip in the land to conceal herself.\\nBeyond the \\nforest, they noticed a change. The countryside was covered with soft turf and \\nheather that their feet sank into. Moss clung to every stone and branch and \\nlined the streams that laced the ground. Pools of mud pocked the road where \\nhorses had trampled the dirt. Before long both Brom and Eragon were splattered \\nwith grime.\\n“Why is \\neverything green?” asked Eragon. “Don’t they have winter here?”\\n“Yes, but the \\nseason is mild. Mist and fog roll in from the sea and keep everything alive. \\nSome find it to their liking, but to me it’s dreary and depressing.”\\nWhen evening \\nfell, they set up camp in the driest spot they could find. As they ate, Brom \\ncommented, “You should continue to ride Cadoc until we reach Teirm. It’s likely \\nthat we’ll meet other travelers now that we are out of the Spine, and it will \\nbe better if you are with me. An old man traveling alone will raise suspicion. \\nWith you at my side, no one will ask questions. Besides, I don’t want to show \\nup at the city and have someone who saw me on the trail wondering where you \\nsuddenly came from.”\\n“Will we use our \\nown names?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom thought \\nabout it. “We won’t be able to deceive Jeod. He already knows my name, and I \\nthink I trust him with yours. But to everyone else, I will be Neal and you will \\nbe my nephew Evan. If our tongues slip and give us away, it probably won’t make \\na difference, but I don’t want our names in anyone’s heads. People have an \\nannoying habit of remembering things they shouldn’t.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAT ASTE OFTEIRM\\nAfter two days of \\ntraveling north toward the ocean, Saphira sighted Teirm. A heavy fog clung to \\nthe ground, obscuring Brom’s and Eragon’s sight until a breeze from the west \\nblew the mist away. Eragon gaped as Teirm was suddenly revealed before them, \\nnestled by the edge of the shimmering sea, where proud ships were docked with \\nfurled sails. The surf’s dull thunder could be heard in the distance.\\nThe city was \\ncontained behind a white wall—a hundred feet tall and thirty feet thick—with \\nrows of rectangular arrow slits lining it and a walkway on top for soldiers and \\nwatchmen. The wall’s smooth surface was broken by two iron portcullises, one \\nfacing the western sea, the other opening south to the road. Above the wall—and \\nset against its northeast section—rose a huge citadel built of giant stones and \\nturrets. In the highest tower, a lighthouse lantern gleamed brilliantly. The \\ncastle was the only thing visible over the fortifications.\\nSoldiers guarded \\nthe southern gate but held their pikes carelessly. “This is our first test,” \\nsaid Brom. “Let’s hope they haven’t received reports of us from the Empire and \\nwon’t detain us. Whatever happens, don’t panic or act suspiciously.”\\nEragon told \\nSaphira,You should land somewhere now and hide. We’re going in.\\nSticking your \\nnose where it doesn’t belong. Again,she said sourly.\\nI know. But Brom \\nand I do have some advantages most people don’t.We’ll be all right. \\nIf anything \\nhappens, I’m going to pin you to my back and never let you off. \\nI love you too. \\nThen I will bind \\nyou all the tighter.\\n\\nEragon and Brom \\nrode toward the gate, trying to appear casual. A yellow pennant bearing the \\noutline of a roaring lion and an arm holding a lily blossom waved over the \\nentrance. As they neared the wall, Eragon asked in amazement, “How big is this \\nplace?”\\n“Larger than any \\ncity you have ever seen,” said Brom.\\nAt the entrance \\nto Teirm, the guards stood straighter and blocked the gate with their pikes. \\n“Wha’s yer name?” asked one of them in a bored tone.\\n“I’m called \\nNeal,” said Brom in a wheezy voice, slouching to one side, an expression of \\nhappy idiocy on his face.\\n“And who’s th’ \\nother one?” asked the guard.\\n“Well, I wus \\ngettin’ to that. This’ed be m’nephew Evan. He’s m’sister’s boy, not a . . .”\\nThe guard nodded \\nimpatiently. “Yeah, yeah. And yer business here?”\\n“He’s visitin’ \\nan old friend,” supplied Eragon, dropping his voice into a thick accent. “I’m \\nalong t’ make sure he don’t get lost, if y’ get m’meaning. He ain’t as young as \\nhe used to be—had a bit too much sun when he was young’r. Touch o’ the brain \\nfever, y’ know.” Brom bobbed his head pleasantly.\\n“Right. Go on \\nthrough,” said the guard, waving his hand and dropping the pike. “Just make \\nsure he doesn’t cause any trouble.”\\n“Oh, he won’t,” \\npromised Eragon. He urged Cadoc forward, and they rode into Teirm. The \\ncobblestone street clacked under the horses’ hooves.\\nOnce they were \\naway from the guards, Brom sat up and growled, “Touch of brain fever, eh?”\\n“I couldn’t let \\nyou have all the fun,” teased Eragon.\\nBrom harrumphed \\nand looked away.\\nThe houses were \\ngrim and foreboding. Small, deep windows let in only sparse rays of light. \\nNarrow doors were recessed into the buildings. The tops of the roofs were \\nflat—except for metal railings—and all were covered with slate shingles. Eragon \\nnoticed that the houses closest to Teirm’s outer wall were no more than one \\nstory, but the buildings got progressively higher as they went in. Those next \\nto the citadel were tallest of all, though insignificant compared to the \\nfortress.\\n“This place \\nlooks ready for war,” said Eragon.\\nBrom nodded. \\n“Teirm has a history of being attacked by pirates, Urgals, and other enemies. \\nIt has long been a center of commerce. There will always be conflict where \\nriches gather in such abundance. The people here have been forced to take extraordinary \\nmeasures to keep themselves from being overrun. It also helps that Galbatorix \\ngives them soldiers to defend their city.”\\n“Why are some \\nhouses higher than others?”\\n“Look at the \\ncitadel,” said Brom, pointing. “It has an unobstructed view of Teirm. If the \\nouter wall were breached, archers would be posted on all the roofs. Because the \\nhouses in the front, by the outer wall, are lower, the men farther back could \\nshoot over them without fear of hitting their comrades. Also, if the enemy were \\nto capture those houses and put their own archers on them, it would be an easy \\nmatter to shoot them down.”\\n“I’ve never seen \\na city planned like this,” said Eragon in wonder.\\n“Yes, but it was \\nonly done after Teirm was nearly burned down by a pirate raid,” commented Brom. \\nAs they continued up the street, people gave them searching looks, but there \\nwas not an undue amount of interest.\\nCompared to our \\nreception at Daret, we’ve been welcomed with open arms. Perhaps Teirm has \\nescaped notice by the Urgals,thought Eragon. He changed his opinion \\nwhen a large man shouldered past them, a sword hanging from his waist. There \\nwere other, subtler signs of adverse times: no children played in the streets, \\npeople bore hard expressions, and many houses were deserted, with weeds growing \\nfrom cracks in their stone-covered yards. “It looks like they’ve had trouble,” \\nsaid Eragon.\\n“The same as \\neverywhere else,” said Brom grimly. “We have to find Jeod.” They led their \\nhorses across the street to a tavern and tied them to the hitching post. “The \\nGreen Chestnut . . . wonderful,” muttered Brom, looking at the battered sign \\nabove them as he and Eragon entered the building.\\nThe dingy room \\nfelt unsafe. A fire smoldered in the fireplace, yet no one bothered to throw \\nmore wood on it. A few lonely people in the corners nursed their drinks with \\nsullen expressions. A man missing two fingers sat at a far table, eyeing his \\ntwitching stumps. The bartender had a cynical twist to his lips and held a \\nglass in his hand that he kept polishing, even though it was broken.\\nBrom leaned \\nagainst the bar and asked, “Do you know where we can find a man called Jeod?” \\nEragon stood at his side, fiddling with the tip of his bow by his waist. It was \\nslung across his back, but right then he wished that it were in his hands.\\nThe bartender \\nsaid in an overly loud voice, “Now, why would I know something like that? Do \\nyou think I keep track of the mangy louts in this forsaken place?” Eragon \\nwinced as all eyes turned toward them.\\nBrom kept \\ntalking smoothly. “Could you be enticed to remember?” He slid some coins onto \\nthe bar.\\nThe man \\nbrightened and put his glass down. “Could be,” he replied, lowering his voice, \\n“but my memory takes a great deal of prodding.” Brom’s face soured, but he slid \\nmore coins onto the bar. The bartender sucked on one side of his cheek \\nundecidedly. “All right,” he finally said, and reached for the coins.\\nBefore he \\ntouched them, the man missing two fingers called out from his table, “Gareth, \\nwhat in th’ blazes do you think you’re doing? Anyone on the street could tell \\nthem where Jeod lives. What are you charging them for?”\\nBrom swept the \\ncoins back into his purse. Gareth shot a venomous look at the man at the table, \\nthen turned his back on them and picked up the glass again. Brom went to the \\nstranger and said, “Thanks. The name’s Neal. This is Evan.”\\nThe man raised \\nhis mug to them. “Martin, and of course you met Gareth.” His voice was deep and \\nrough. Martin gestured at some empty chairs. “Go ahead and sit down. I don’t \\nmind.” Eragon took a chair and arranged it so his back was to the wall and he \\nfaced the door. Martin raised an eyebrow, but made no comment.\\n“You just saved \\nme a few crowns,” said Brom.\\n“My pleasure. \\nCan’t blame Gareth, though—business hasn’t been doing so well lately.” Martin \\nscratched his chin. “Jeod lives on the west side of town, right next to Angela, \\nthe herbalist. Do you have business with him?”\\n“Of a sort,” \\nsaid Brom.\\n“Well, he won’t \\nbe interested in buying anything; he just lost another ship a few days ago.”\\nBrom latched \\nonto the news with interest. “What happened? It wasn’t Urgals, was it?”\\n“No,” said \\nMartin. “They’ve left the area. No one’s seen ’em in almost a year. It seems \\nthey’ve all gone south and east. But they aren’t the problem. See, most of our \\nbusiness is through sea trade, as I’m sure you know. Well,” he stopped to drink \\nfrom his mug, “starting several months ago, someone’s been attacking our ships. \\nIt’s not the usual piracy, because only ships that carry the goods of certain \\nmerchants are attacked. Jeod’s one of ’em. It’s gotten so bad that no captain \\nwill accept those merchants’ goods, which makes life difficult around here. \\nEspecially because some of ’em run the largest shipping businesses in the \\nEmpire. They’re being forced to send goods by land. It’s driven costs painfully \\nhigh, and their caravans don’t always make it.”\\n“Do you have any \\nidea who’s responsible? There must be witnesses,” said Brom.\\nMartin shook his \\nhead. “No one survives the attacks. Ships go out, then disappear; they’re never \\nseen again.” He leaned toward them and said in a confidential tone, “The \\nsailors are saying that it’s magic.” He nodded and winked, then leaned back.\\nBrom seemed \\nworried by his words. “What do you think?”\\nMartin shrugged \\ncarelessly. “I don’t know. And I don’t think I will unless I’m unfortunate enough \\nto be on one of those captured ships.”\\n“Are you a \\nsailor?” asked Eragon.\\n“No,” snorted \\nMartin. “Do I look like one? The captains hire me to defend their ships against \\npirates. And those thieving scum haven’t been very active lately. Still, it’s a \\ngood job.”\\n“But a dangerous \\none,” said Brom. Martin shrugged again and downed the last of his beer. Brom \\nand Eragon took their leave and headed to the west side of the city, a nicer \\nsection of Teirm. The houses were clean, ornate, and large. The people in the \\nstreets wore expensive finery and walked with authority. Eragon felt \\nconspicuous and out of place.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA NOLDFRIEND\\nThe herbalist’s \\nshop had a cheery sign and was easy to find. A short, curly-haired woman sat by \\nthe door. She was holding a frog in one hand and writing with the other. Eragon \\nassumed that she was Angela, the herbalist. On either side of the store was a \\nhouse. “Which one do you think is his?” he asked.\\nBrom \\ndeliberated, then said, “Let’s find out.” He approached the woman and asked \\npolitely, “Could you tell us which house Jeod lives in?”\\n“I could.” She \\ncontinued writing.\\n“Will you tell \\nus?”\\n“Yes.” She fell \\nsilent, but her pen scribbled faster than ever. The frog on her hand croaked \\nand looked at them with baleful eyes. Brom and Eragon waited uncomfortably, but \\nshe said no more. Eragon was about to blurt something out when Angela looked \\nup. “Of course I’ll tell you! All you have to do is ask. Your first question \\nwas whether or not Icould tell you, and the second was if Iwould \\ntell you. But you never actually put the question to me.”\\n“Then let me ask \\nproperly,” said Brom with a smile. “Which house is Jeod’s? And why are you \\nholding a frog?”\\n“Now we’re \\ngetting somewhere,” she bantered. “Jeod is on the right. And as for the frog, \\nhe’s actually a toad. I’m trying to prove that toads don’t exist—that there are \\nonly frogs.”\\n“How can toads \\nnot exist if you have one on your hand right now?” interrupted Eragon. \\n“Besides, what good will it do, proving that there are only frogs?”\\nThe woman shook \\nher head vigorously, dark curls bouncing. “No, no, you don’t understand. If I \\nprove toads don’t exist, then this is a frog and never was a toad. Therefore, \\nthe toad you see now doesn’t exist. And,” she raised a small finger, “if I can \\nprove there are only frogs, then toads won’t be able to do anything bad—like \\nmake teeth fall out, cause warts, and poison or kill people. Also, witches \\nwon’t be able to use any of their evil spells because, of course, there won’t \\nbe any toads around.”\\n“I see,” said \\nBrom delicately. “It sounds interesting, and I would like to hear more, but we \\nhave to meet Jeod.”\\n“Of course,” she \\nsaid, waving her hand and returning to her writing.\\nOnce they were \\nout of the herbalist’s hearing, Eragon said, “She’s crazy!”\\n“It’s possible,” \\nsaid Brom, “but you never know. She might discover something useful, so don’t \\ncriticize. Who knows, toads might really be frogs!”\\n“And my shoes \\nare made of gold,” retorted Eragon.\\nThey stopped \\nbefore a door with a wrought-iron knocker and marble doorstep. Brom banged \\nthree times. No one answered. Eragon felt slightly foolish. “Maybe this is the \\nwrong house. Let’s try the other one,” he said. Brom ignored him and knocked \\nagain, pounding loudly.\\nAgain no one \\nanswered. Eragon turned away in exasperation, then heard someone run to the \\ndoor. A young woman with a pale complexion and light blond hair cracked it \\nopen. Her eyes were puffy; it looked like she had been crying, but her voice \\nwas perfectly steady. “Yes, what do you want?”\\n“Does Jeod live \\nhere?” asked Brom kindly.\\nThe woman dipped \\nher head a little. “Yes, he is my husband. Is he expecting you?” She opened the \\ndoor no farther.\\n“No, but we need \\nto talk with him,” said Brom.\\n“He is very \\nbusy.”\\n“We have \\ntraveled far. It’s very important that we see him.”\\nHer face \\nhardened. “He is busy.”\\nBrom bristled, \\nbut his voice stayed pleasant. “Since he is unavailable, would you please give \\nhim a message?” Her mouth twitched, but she consented. “Tell him that a friend \\nfrom Gil’ead is waiting outside.”\\nThe woman seemed \\nsuspicious, but said, “Very well.” She closed the door abruptly. Eragon heard \\nher footsteps recede.\\n“That wasn’t \\nvery polite.” he commented.\\n“Keep your \\nopinions to yourself,” snapped Brom. “And don’t say anything. Let me do the \\ntalking.” He crossed his arms and tapped his fingers. Eragon clamped his mouth \\nshut and looked away.\\nThe door \\nsuddenly flew open, and a tall man burst out of the house. His expensive \\nclothes were rumpled, his gray hair wispy, and he had a mournful face with \\nshort eyebrows. A long scar stretched across his scalp to his temple.\\nAt the sight of \\nthem, his eyes grew wide, and he sagged against the doorframe, speechless. His \\nmouth opened and closed several times like a gasping fish. He asked softly, in \\nan incredulous voice, “Brom . . . ?”\\nBrom put a \\nfinger to his lips and reached forward, clasping the man’s arm. “It’s good to \\nsee you, Jeod! I’m glad that memory has not failed you, but don’t use that \\nname. It would be unfortunate if anyone knew I was here.”\\nJeod looked \\naround wildly, shock plain on his face. “I thought you were dead,” he \\nwhispered. “What happened? Why haven’t you contacted me before?”\\n“All things will \\nbe explained. Do you have a place where we can talk safely?”\\nJeod hesitated, \\nswinging his gaze between Eragon and Brom, face unreadable. Finally he said, \\n“We can’t talk here, but if you wait a moment, I’ll take you somewhere we can.”\\n“Fine,” said \\nBrom. Jeod nodded and vanished behind the door.\\nI hope I can \\nlearn something of Brom’s past,thought Eragon.\\nThere was a \\nrapier at Jeod’s side when he reappeared. An embroidered jacket hung loosely on \\nhis shoulders, matched by a plumed hat. Brom cast a critical eye at the finery, \\nand Jeod shrugged self-consciously.\\nHe took them \\nthrough Teirm toward the citadel. Eragon led the horses behind the two men. \\nJeod gestured at their destination. “Risthart, the lord of Teirm, has decreed \\nthat all the business owners must have their headquarters in his castle. Even \\nthough most of us conduct our business elsewhere, we still have to rent rooms \\nthere. It’s nonsense, but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm. We’ll be free \\nof eavesdroppers in there; the walls are thick.”\\nThey went \\nthrough the fortress’s main gate and into the keep. Jeod strode to a side door \\nand pointed to an iron ring. “You can tie the horses there. No one will bother \\nthem.” When Snowfire and Cadoc were safely tethered, he opened the door with an \\niron key and let them inside.\\nWithin was a \\nlong, empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls. Eragon was surprised by \\nhow cold and damp it was. When he touched the wall, his fingers slid over a \\nlayer of slime. He shivered.\\nJeod snatched a \\ntorch from its bracket and led them down the hall. They stopped before a heavy, \\nwooden door. He unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a \\nbearskin rug laden with stuffed chairs. Bookshelves stacked with leather-bound \\ntomes covered the walls.\\nJeod piled wood \\nin the fireplace, then thrust the torch under it. The fire quickly roared. \\n“You, old man, have some explaining to do.”\\nBrom’s face \\ncrinkled with a smile. “Who are you calling an old man? The last time I saw you \\nthere was no gray in your hair. Now it looks like it’s in the final stages of \\ndecomposition.”\\n“And you look \\nthe same as you did nearly twenty years ago. Time seems to have preserved you \\nas a crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation. Enough \\nof this! Get on with the story. That’s always what you were good at,” said Jeod \\nimpatiently. Eragon’s ears pricked up, and he waited eagerly to hear what Brom \\nwould say.\\nBrom relaxed \\ninto a chair and pulled out his pipe. He slowly blew a smoke ring that turned \\ngreen, darted into the fireplace, then flew up the chimney. “Do you remember \\nwhat we were doing in Gil’ead?”\\n“Yes, of \\ncourse,” said Jeod. “That sort of thing is hard to forget.”\\n“An \\nunderstatement, but true nevertheless,” said Brom dryly. “When we were . . . \\nseparated, I couldn’t find you. In the midst of the turmoil I stumbled into a \\nsmall room. There wasn’t anything extraordinary in it—just crates and boxes—but \\nout of curiosity, I rummaged around anyway. Fortune smiled on me that hour, for \\nI found what we had been searching for.” An expression of shock ran over Jeod’s \\nface. “Once it was in my hands, I couldn’t wait for you. At any second I might \\nhave been discovered, and all lost. Disguising myself as best I could, I fled \\nthe city and ran to the . . .” Brom hesitated and glanced at Eragon, then said, \\n“ran to our friends. They stored it in a vault, for safekeeping, and made me promise \\nto care for whomever received it. Until the day when my skills would be needed, \\nI had to disappear. No one could know that I was alive—not even you—though it \\ngrieved me to pain you unnecessarily. So I went north and hid in Carvahall.”\\nEragon clenched \\nhis jaw, infuriated that Brom was deliberately keeping him in the dark.\\nJeod frowned and \\nasked, “Then our . . . friends knew that you were alive all along?”\\n“Yes.”\\nHe sighed. “I \\nsuppose the ruse was unavoidable, though I wish they had told me. Isn’t Carvahall \\nfarther north, on the other side of the Spine?” Brom inclined his head. For the \\nfirst time, Jeod inspected Eragon. His gray eyes took in every detail. He \\nraised his eyebrows and said, “I assume, then, that you are fulfilling your \\nduty.”\\nBrom shook his head. \\n“No, it’s not that simple. It was stolen a while ago—at least that’s what I \\npresume, for I haven’t received word from our friends, and I suspect their \\nmessengers were waylaid—so I decided to find out what I could. Eragon happened \\nto be traveling in the same direction. We have stayed together for a time now.”\\nJeod looked \\npuzzled. “But if they haven’t sent any messages, how could you know that it \\nwas—”\\nBrom overrode \\nhim quickly, saying, “Eragon’s uncle was brutally killed by the Ra’zac. They \\nburned his home and nearly caught him in the process. He deserves revenge, but \\nthey have left us without a trail to follow, and we need help finding them.”\\nJeod’s face \\ncleared. “I see. . . . But why have you come here? I don’t know where the \\nRa’zac might be hiding, and anyone who does won’t tell you.”\\nStanding, Brom \\nreached into his robe and pulled out the Ra’zac’s flask. He tossed it to Jeod. \\n“There’s Seithr oil in there—the dangerous kind. The Ra’zac were carrying it. \\nThey lost it by the trail, and we happened to find it. We need to see Teirm’s \\nshipping records so we can trace the Empire’s purchases of the oil. That should \\ntell us where the Ra’zac’s lair is.”\\nLines appeared \\non Jeod’s face as he thought. He pointed at the books on the shelves. “Do you \\nsee those? They are all records from my business.One business. You have \\ngotten yourself into a project that could take months. There is another, \\ngreater problem. The records you seek are held in this castle, but only Brand, \\nRisthart’s administrator of trade, sees them on a regular basis. Traders such \\nas myself aren’t allowed to handle them. They fear that we will falsify the \\nresults, thus cheating the Empire of its precious taxes.”\\n“I can deal with \\nthat when the time comes,” said Brom. “But we need a few days of rest before we \\ncan think about proceeding.”\\nJeod smiled. “It \\nseems that it is my turn to help you. My house is yours, of course. Do you have \\nanother name while you are here?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nBrom, “I’m Neal, and the boy is Evan.”\\n“Eragon,” said \\nJeod thoughtfully. “You have a unique name. Few have ever been named after the \\nfirst Rider. In my life I’ve read about only three people who were called \\nsuch.” Eragon was startled that Jeod knew the origin of his name.\\nBrom looked at \\nEragon. “Could you go check on the horses and make sure they’re all right? I \\ndon’t think I tied Snowfire to the ring tightly enough.”\\nThey’re trying \\nto hide something from me. The moment I leave they’re going to talk about it.Eragon shoved \\nhimself out of the chair and left the room, slamming the door shut. Snowfire \\nhad not moved; the knot that held him was fine. Scratching the horses’ necks, \\nEragon leaned sullenly against the castle wall.\\nIt’s not fair,he complained to \\nhimself.If only I could hear what they are saying. He jolted upright, \\nelectrified. Brom had once taught him some words that would enhance his \\nhearing.Keen ears aren’t exactly what I want, but I should be able to make \\nthe words work. After all, look what I could do with brisingr!\\nHe concentrated \\nintensely and reached for his power. Once it was within his grasp, he said, \\n“Thverr stenr un atra eka hórna!” and imbued the words with his will. As the \\npower rushed out of him, he heard a faint whisper in his ears, but nothing \\nmore. Disappointed, he sank back, then started as Jeod said, “—and I’ve been \\ndoing that for almost eight years now.”\\nEragon looked \\naround. No one was there except for a few guards standing against the far wall \\nof the keep. Grinning, he sat on the courtyard and closed his eyes.\\n“I never \\nexpected you to become a merchant,” said Brom. “After all the time you spent in \\nbooks. And finding the passageway in that manner! What made you take up trading \\ninstead of remaining a scholar?”\\n“After Gil’ead, \\nI didn’t have much taste for sitting in musty rooms and reading scrolls. I \\ndecided to help Ajihad as best I could, but I’m no warrior. My father was a \\nmerchant as well—you may remember that. He helped me get started. However, the \\nbulk of my business is nothing more than a front to get goods into Surda.”\\n“But I take it \\nthat things have been going badly,” said Brom.\\n“Yes, none of \\nthe shipments have gotten through lately, and Tronjheim is running low on \\nsupplies. Somehow the Empire—at least I think it’s them—has discovered those of \\nus who have been helping to support Tronjheim. But I’m still not convinced that \\nit’s the Empire. No one sees any soldiers. I don’t understand it. Perhaps \\nGalbatorix hired mercenaries to harass us.”\\n“I heard that \\nyou lost a ship recently.”\\n“The last one I \\nowned,” answered Jeod bitterly. “Every man on it was loyal and brave. I doubt \\nI’ll ever see them again. . . . The only option I have left is to send caravans \\nto Surda or Gil’ead—which I know won’t get there, no matter how many guards I \\nhire—or charter someone else’s ship to carry the goods. But no one will take \\nthem now.”\\n“How many \\nmerchants have been helping you?” asked Brom.\\n“Oh, a good \\nnumber up and down the seaboard. All of them have been plagued by the same \\ntroubles. I know what you are thinking; I’ve pondered it many a night myself, \\nbut I cannot bear the thought of a traitor with that much knowledge and power. \\nIf there is one, we’re all in jeopardy. You should return to Tronjheim.”\\n“And take Eragon \\nthere?” interrupted Brom. “They’d tear him apart. It’s the worst place he could \\nbe right now. Maybe in a few months or, even better, a year. Can you imagine \\nhow the dwarves will react? Everyone will be trying to influence him, \\nespecially Islanzadi. He and Saphira won’t be safe in Tronjheim until I at \\nleast get them through tuatha du orothrim.”\\nDwarves!thought Eragon \\nexcitedly.Where is this Tronjheim? And why did he tell Jeod about Saphira? \\nHe shouldn’t have done that without asking me!\\n“Still, I have a \\nfeeling that they are in need of your power and wisdom.”\\n“Wisdom,” \\nsnorted Brom. “I’m just what you said earlier—a crotchety old man.”\\n“Many would \\ndisagree.”\\n“Let them. I’ve \\nno need to explain myself. No, Ajihad will have to get along without me. What \\nI’m doing now is much more important. But the prospect of a traitor raises \\ntroubling questions. I wonder if that’s how the Empire knew where to be. . . .” \\nHis voice trailed off.\\n“And I wonder \\nwhy I haven’t been contacted about this,” said Jeod.\\n“Maybe they \\ntried. But if there’s a traitor . . .” Brom paused. “I have to send word to \\nAjihad. Do you have a messenger you can trust?”\\n“I think so,” \\nsaid Jeod. “It depends on where he would have to go.”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Brom. “I’ve been isolated so long, my contacts have probably died or \\nforgotten me. Could you send him to whoever receives your shipments?”\\n“Yes, but it’ll \\nbe risky.”\\n“What isn’t \\nthese days? How soon can he leave?”\\n“He can go in \\nthe morning. I’ll send him to Gil’ead. It will be faster,” said Jeod. “What can \\nhe take to convince Ajihad the message comes from you?”\\n“Here, give your \\nman my ring. And tell him that if he loses it, I’ll personally tear his liver \\nout. It was given to me by the queen.”\\n“Aren’t you \\ncheery,” commented Jeod.\\nBrom grunted. \\nAfter a long silence he said, “We’d better go out and join Eragon. I get \\nworried when he’s alone. That boy has an unnatural propensity for being \\nwherever there’s trouble.”\\n“Are you \\nsurprised?”\\n“Not really.”\\nEragon heard \\nchairs being pushed back. He quickly pulled his mind away and opened his eyes. \\n“What’s going on?” he muttered to himself.Jeod and other traders are in \\ntrouble for helping people the Empire doesn’t favor. Brom found something in \\nGil’ead and went to Carvahall to hide. What could be so important that he would \\nlet his own friend think he was dead for nearly twenty years? He mentioned a \\nqueen—when there aren’t any queens in the known kingdoms—and dwarves, who, as \\nhe himself told me, disappeared underground long ago.\\nHe wanted \\nanswers! But he would not confront Brom now and risk jeopardizing their \\nmission. No, he would wait until they left Teirm, and then he would persist \\nuntil the old man explained his secrets. Eragon’s thoughts were still whirling \\nwhen the door opened.\\n“Were the horses \\nall right?” asked Brom.\\n“Fine,” said \\nEragon. They untied the horses and left the castle.\\nAs they \\nreentered the main body of Teirm, Brom said, “So, Jeod, you finally got \\nmarried. And,” he winked slyly, “to a lovely young woman. Congratulations.”\\nJeod did not seem \\nhappy with the compliment. He hunched his shoulders and stared down at the \\nstreet. “Whether congratulations are in order is debatable right now. Helen \\nisn’t very happy.”\\n“Why? What does \\nshe want?” asked Brom.\\n“The usual,” \\nsaid Jeod with a resigned shrug. “A good home, happy children, food on the \\ntable, and pleasant company. The problem is that she comes from a wealthy \\nfamily; her father has invested heavily in my business. If I keep suffering \\nthese losses, there won’t be enough money for her to live the way she’s used \\nto.”\\nJeod continued, \\n“But please, my troubles are not your troubles. A host should never bother his \\nguests with his own concerns. While you are in my house, I will let nothing \\nmore than an over-full stomach disturb you.”\\n“Thank you,” \\nsaid Brom. “We appreciate the hospitality. Our travels have long been without \\ncomforts of any kind. Do you happen to know where we could find an inexpensive \\nshop? All this riding has worn out our clothes.”\\n“Of course. \\nThat’s my job,” said Jeod, lightening up. He talked eagerly about prices and \\nstores until his house was in sight. Then he asked, “Would you mind if we went \\nsomewhere else to eat? It might be awkward if you came in right now.”\\n“Whatever makes \\nyou feel comfortable,” said Brom.\\nJeod looked \\nrelieved. “Thanks. Let’s leave your horses in my stable.”\\nThey did as he \\nsuggested, then followed him to a large tavern. Unlike the Green Chestnut, this \\none was loud, clean, and full of boisterous people. When the main course \\narrived—a stuffed suckling pig—Eragon eagerly dug into the meat, but he \\nespecially savored the potatoes, carrots, turnips, and sweet apples that \\naccompanied it. It had been a long time since he had eaten much more than wild \\ngame.\\nThey lingered \\nover the meal for hours as Brom and Jeod swapped stories. Eragon did not mind. \\nHe was warm, a lively tune jangled in the background, and there was more than \\nenough food. The spirited tavern babble fell pleasantly on his ears.\\nWhen they \\nfinally exited the tavern, the sun was nearing the horizon. “You two go ahead; \\nI have to check on something,” Eragon said. He wanted to see Saphira and make \\nsure that she was safely hidden.\\nBrom agreed \\nabsently. “Be careful. Don’t take too long.”\\n“Wait,” said \\nJeod. “Are you going outside Teirm?” Eragon hesitated, then reluctantly nodded. \\n“Make sure you’re inside the walls before dark. The gates close then, and the \\nguards won’t let you back in until morning.”\\n“I won’t be \\nlate,” promised Eragon. He turned around and loped down a side street, toward \\nTeirm’s outer wall. Once out of the city, he breathed deeply, enjoying the \\nfresh air.Saphira! he called.Where are you? She guided him off \\nthe road, to the base of a mossy cliff surrounded by maples. He saw her head \\npoke out of the trees on the top and waved.How am I supposed to get up there?\\nIf you find a \\nclearing, I’ll come down and get you. \\nNo,he said, eyeing \\nthe cliff,that won’t be necessary.I’ll just climb up.\\nIt’s too \\ndangerous.\\n\\nAnd you worry \\ntoo much. Let me have some fun. \\nEragon pulled \\noff his gloves and started climbing. He relished the physical challenge. There \\nwere plenty of handholds, so the ascent was easy. He was soon high above the \\ntrees. Halfway up, he stopped on a ledge to catch his breath.\\nOnce his \\nstrength returned, he stretched up for the next handhold, but his arm was not \\nlong enough. Stymied, he searched for another crevice or ridge to grasp. There \\nwas none. He tried backing down, but his legs could not reach his last \\nfoothold. Saphira watched with unblinking eyes. He gave up and said,I could \\nuse some help.\\nThis is your own \\nfault.\\n\\nYes! I know. Are \\nyou going to get me down or not? \\nIf I weren’t \\naround, you would be in a very bad situation. \\nEragon rolled \\nhis eyes.You don’t have to tell me.\\nYou’re right. \\nAfter all, how can a mere dragon expect to tell a man like yourself what to do? \\nIn fact, everyone should stand in awe of your brilliance of finding the only \\ndead end. Why, if you had started a few feet in either direction, the path to \\nthe top would have been clear.She cocked her head at him, eyes bright.\\nAll right! I \\nmade a mistake. Now can you please get me out of here?he pleaded. She \\npulled her head back from the edge of the cliff. After a moment he called, \\n“Saphira?” Above him were only swaying trees. “Saphira! Come back!” he roared.\\nWith a loud \\ncrash Saphira barreled off the top of the cliff, flipping around in midair. She \\nfloated down to Eragon like a huge bat and grabbed his shirt with her claws, \\nscratching his back. He let go of the rocks as she yanked him up in the air. \\nAfter a brief flight, she set him down gently on the top of the cliff and \\ntugged her claws out of his shirt.\\nFoolishness,said Saphira \\ngently.\\nEragon looked \\naway, studying the landscape. The cliff provided a wonderful view of their \\nsurroundings, especially the foaming sea, as well as protection against \\nunwelcome eyes. Only birds would see Saphira here. It was an ideal location.\\nIs Brom’s friend \\ntrustworthy?she \\nasked.\\nI don’t know.Eragon proceeded \\nto recount the day’s events.There are forces circling us that we aren’t \\naware of. Sometimes I wonder if we can ever understand the true motives of the \\npeople around us. They all seem to have secrets.\\nIt is the way of \\nthe world. Ignore all the schemes and trust in the nature of each person. Brom \\nis good. He means us no harm. We don’t have to fear his plans. \\nI hope so,he said, looking \\ndown at his hands.\\nThis finding of \\nthe Ra’zac through writing is a strange way of tracking,she remarked.Would \\nthere be a way to use magic to see the records without being inside the room?\\nI’m not sure. \\nYou would have to combine the word forseeingwithdistance. . . or \\nmaybelightanddistance.Either way, it seems rather difficult. I’ll \\nask Brom.\\nThat would be \\nwise.They \\nlapsed into tranquil silence.\\nYou know, we may \\nhave to stay here awhile. \\nSaphira’s answer \\nheld a hard edge.And as always, I will be left to wait outside.\\nThat is not how \\nI want it. Soon enough we will travel together again. \\nMay that day \\ncome quickly.\\n\\nEragon smiled \\nand hugged her. He noticed then how rapidly the light was fading.I have to \\ngo now, before I’m locked out of Teirm. Hunt tomorrow, and I will see you in \\nthe evening.\\nShe spread her \\nwings.Come, I will take you down. He got onto her scaly back and held on \\ntightly as she launched off the cliff, glided over the trees, then landed on a \\nknoll. Eragon thanked her and ran back to Teirm.\\nHe came into \\nsight of the portcullis just as it was beginning to lower. Calling for them to \\nwait, he put on a burst of speed and slipped inside seconds before the gateway \\nslammed closed. “Ya cut that a little close,” observed one of the guards.\\n“It won’t happen \\nagain,” assured Eragon, bending over to catch his breath. He wound his way \\nthrough the darkened city to Jeod’s house. A lantern hung outside like a \\nbeacon.\\nA plump butler \\nanswered his knock and ushered him inside without a word. Tapestries covered \\nthe stone walls. Elaborate rugs dotted the polished wood floor, which glowed \\nwith the light from three gold candelabra hanging from the ceiling. Smoke drifted \\nthrough the air and collected above.\\n“This way, sir. \\nYour friend is in the study.”\\nThey passed \\nscores of doorways until the butler opened one to reveal a study. Books covered \\nthe room’s walls. But unlike those in Jeod’s office, these came in every size \\nand shape. A fireplace filled with blazing logs warmed the room. Brom and Jeod \\nsat before an oval writing desk, talking amiably. Brom raised his pipe and said \\nin a jovial voice, “Ah, here you are. We were getting worried about you. How \\nwas your walk?”\\nI wonder what \\nput him in such a good mood? Why doesn’t he just come out and ask how Saphira \\nis?“Pleasant, \\nbut the guards almost locked me outside the city. And Teirm is big. I had \\ntrouble finding this house.”\\nJeod chuckled. \\n“When you have seen Dras-Leona, Gil’ead, or even Kuasta, you won’t be so easily \\nimpressed by this small ocean city. I like it here, though. When it’s not \\nraining, Teirm is really quite beautiful.”\\nEragon turned to \\nBrom. “Do you have any idea how long we’ll be here?”\\nBrom spread his \\npalms upward. “That’s hard to tell. It depends on whether we can get to the \\nrecords and how long it will take us to find what we need. We’ll all have to \\nhelp; it will be a huge job. I’ll talk with Brand tomorrow and see if he’ll let \\nus examine the records.”\\n“I don’t think \\nI’ll be able to help,” Eragon said, shifting uneasily.\\n“Why not?” asked \\nBrom. “There will be plenty of work for you.”\\nEragon lowered \\nhis head. “I can’t read.”\\nBrom \\nstraightened with disbelief. “You mean Garrow never taught you?”\\n“He knew how to \\nread?” asked Eragon, puzzled. Jeod watched them with interest.\\n“Of course he \\ndid,” snorted Brom. “The proud fool—what was he thinking? I should have \\nrealized that he wouldn’t have taught you. He probably considered it an \\nunnecessary luxury.” Brom scowled and pulled at his beard angrily. “This sets \\nmy plans back, but not irreparably. I’ll just have to teach you how to read. It \\nwon’t take long if you put your mind to it.”\\nEragon winced. \\nBrom’s lessons were usually intense and brutally direct.How much more can I \\nlearn at one time? “I suppose it’s necessary,” he said ruefully.\\n“You’ll enjoy \\nit. There is much you can learn from books and scrolls,” said Jeod. He gestured \\nat the walls. “These books are my friends, my companions. They make me laugh \\nand cry and find meaning in life.”\\n“It sounds \\nintriguing,” admitted Eragon.\\n“Always the \\nscholar, aren’t you?” asked Brom.\\nJeod shrugged. \\n“Not anymore. I’m afraid I’ve degenerated into a bibliophile.”\\n“A what?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“One who loves \\nbooks,” explained Jeod, and resumed conversing with Brom. Bored, Eragon scanned \\nthe shelves. An elegant book set with gold studs caught his attention. He \\npulled it off the shelf and stared at it curiously.\\nIt was bound in \\nblack leather carved with mysterious runes. Eragon ran his fingers over the \\ncover and savored its cool smoothness. The letters inside were printed with a \\nreddish glossy ink. He let the pages slip past his fingers. A column of script, \\nset off from the regular lettering, caught his eye. The words were long and \\nflowing, full of graceful lines and sharp points.\\nEragon took the \\nbook to Brom. “What is this?” he asked, pointing to the strange writing.\\nBrom looked at \\nthe page closely and raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Jeod, you’ve expanded \\nyour collection. Where did you get this? I haven’t seen one in ages.”\\nJeod strained \\nhis neck to see the book. “Ah yes, theDomia abr Wyrda. A man came \\nthrough here a few years ago and tried to sell it to a trader down by the \\nwharves. Fortunately, I happened to be there and was able to save the book, \\nalong with his neck. He didn’t have a clue what it was.”\\n“It’s odd, \\nEragon, that you should pick up this book, theDominance of Fate, ” said \\nBrom. “Of all the items in this house, it’s probably worth the most. It details \\na complete history of Alagaësia—starting long before the elves landed here and \\nending a few decades ago. The book is very rare and is the best of its kind. \\nWhen it was written, the Empire decried it as blasphemy and burned the author, \\nHeslant the Monk. I didn’t think any copies still existed. The lettering you \\nasked about is from the ancient language.”\\n“What does it \\nsay?” asked Eragon.\\nIt took Brom a \\nmoment to read the writing. “It’s part of an elven poem that tells of the years \\nthey fought the dragons. This excerpt describes one of their kings, Ceranthor, \\nas he rides into battle. The elves love this poem and tell it regularly—though \\nyou need three days to do it properly—so that they won’t repeat the mistakes of \\nthe past. At times they sing it so beautifully it seems the very rocks will cry.”\\nEragon returned \\nto his chair, holding the book gently.It’s amazing that a man who is dead \\ncan talk to people through these pages. As long as this book survives, his \\nideas live. I wonder if it contains any information about the Ra’zac?\\nHe browsed through \\nthe book while Brom and Jeod spoke. Hours passed, and Eragon began to drowse. \\nOut of pity for his exhaustion, Jeod bid them good night. “The butler will show \\nyou to your rooms.”\\nOn the way \\nupstairs, the servant said, “If you need assistance, use the bellpull next to \\nthe bed.” He stopped before a cluster of three doors, bowed, then backed away.\\nAs Brom entered \\nthe room on the right, Eragon asked, “Can I talk to you?”\\n“You just did, \\nbut come in anyway.”\\nEragon closed \\nthe door behind himself. “Saphira and I had an idea. Is there—”\\nBrom stopped him \\nwith a raised hand and pulled the curtains shut over the window. “When you talk \\nof such things, you would do well to make sure that no unwelcome ears are \\npresent.”\\n“Sorry,” said \\nEragon, berating himself for the slip. “Anyway, is it possible to conjure up an \\nimage of something that you can’t see?”\\nBrom sat on the \\nedge of his bed. “What you are talking about is called scrying. It is quite \\npossible and extremely helpful in some situations, but it has a major drawback. \\nYou can only observe people, places, and things that you’ve already seen. If \\nyou were to scry the Ra’zac, you’d see them all right, but not their \\nsurroundings. There are other problems as well. Let’s say that you wanted to \\nview a page in a book, one that you’d already seen. You could only see the page \\nif the book were open to it. If the book were closed when you tried this, the \\npage would appear completely black.”\\n“Why can’t you \\nview objects that you haven’t seen?” asked Eragon. Even with those limitations, \\nhe realized, scrying could be very useful.I wonder if I could view something \\nleagues away and use magic to affect what was happening there?\\n“Because,” said \\nBrom patiently, “to scry, you have to know what you’re looking at and where to \\ndirect your power. Even if a stranger was described to you, it would still be \\nnigh impossible to view him, not to mention the ground and whatever else might \\nbe around him. You have to knowwhat you’re going to scry before youcan \\nscry it. Does that answer your question?”\\nEragon thought \\nfor a moment. “But how is it done? Do you conjure up the image in thin air?”\\n“Not usually,” \\nsaid Brom, shaking his white head. “That takes more energy than projecting it \\nonto a reflective surface like a pool of water or a mirror. Some Riders used to \\ntravel everywhere they could, trying to see as much as possible. Then, whenever \\nwar or some other calamity occurred, they would be able to view events \\nthroughout Alagaësia.”\\n“May I try it?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nBrom looked at \\nhim carefully. “No, not now. You’re tired, and scrying takes lots of strength. \\nI will tell you the words, but you must promise not to attempt it tonight. And \\nI’d rather you wait until we leave Teirm; I have more to teach you.”\\nEragon smiled. \\n“I promise.”\\n“Very well.” \\nBrom bent over and very quietly whispered, “Draumr kópa” into Eragon’s ear.\\nEragon took a \\nmoment to memorize the words. “Maybe after we’ve left Teirm, I can scry Roran. \\nI would like to know how he’s doing. I’m afraid that the Ra’zac might go after \\nhim.”\\n“I don’t mean to \\nfrighten you, but that’s a distinct possibility,” said Brom. “Although Roran \\nwas gone most of the time the Ra’zac were in Carvahall, I’m sure that they \\nasked questions about him. Who knows, they may have even met him while they \\nwere in Therinsford. Either way, I doubt their curiosity is sated. You’re on \\nthe loose, after all, and the king is probably threatening them with terrible \\npunishment if you aren’t found. If they get frustrated enough, they’ll go back \\nand interrogate Roran. It’s only a matter of time.”\\n“If that’s true, \\nthen the only way to keep Roran safe is to let the Ra’zac know where I am so \\nthat they’ll come after me instead of him.”\\n“No, that won’t \\nwork either. You’re not thinking,” admonished Brom. “If you can’t understand \\nyour enemies, how can you expect to anticipate them? Even if you exposed your \\nlocation, the Ra’zac wouldstill chase Roran. Do you know why?”\\nEragon \\nstraightened and tried to consider every possibility. “Well, if I stay in \\nhiding long enough, they might get frustrated and capture Roran to force me to \\nreveal myself. If that didn’t work, they’d kill him just to hurt me. Also, if I \\nbecome a public enemy of the Empire, they might use him as bait to catch me. \\nAnd if I met with Roran and they found out about it, they would torture him to \\nfind out where I was.”\\n“Very good. You \\nfigured that out quite nicely,” said Brom.\\n“But what’s the \\nsolution? I can’t let him be killed!”\\nBrom clasped his \\nhands loosely. “The solution is quite obvious. Roran is going to have to learn \\nhow to defend himself. That may sound hard-hearted, but as you pointed out, you \\ncannot risk meeting with him. You may not remember this—you were half delirious \\nat the time—but when we left Carvahall, I told you that I had left a warning \\nletter for Roran so he won’t be totally unprepared for danger. If he has any \\nsense at all, when the Ra’zac show up in Carvahall again, he’ll take my advice \\nand flee.”\\n“I don’t like \\nthis,” said Eragon unhappily.\\n“Ah, but you \\nforget something.”\\n“What?” he \\ndemanded.\\n“There is some \\ngood in all of this. The king cannot afford to have a Rider roaming around that \\nhe does not control. Galbatorix is the only known Rider alive besides yourself, \\nbut he would like another one under his command. Before he tries to kill you or \\nRoran, he will offer you the chance to serve him. Unfortunately, if he ever \\ngets close enough to make that proposition, it will be far too late for you to \\nrefuse and still live.”\\n“You call that \\nsome good!”\\n“It’s all that’s \\nprotecting Roran. As long as the king doesn’t know which side you’ve chosen, he \\nwon’t risk alienating you by harming your cousin. Keep that firmly in mind. The \\nRa’zac killed Garrow, but I think it was an ill-considered decision on their \\npart. From what I know of Galbatorix, he would not have approved it unless he \\ngained something from it.”\\n“And how will I \\nbe able to deny the king’s wishes when he is threatening me with death?” asked \\nEragon sharply.\\nBrom sighed. He \\nwent to his nightstand and dipped his fingers in a basin of rose water. \\n“Galbatorix wants your willing cooperation. Without that, you’re worse than \\nuseless to him. So the question becomes, If you are ever faced with this \\nchoice, are you willing to die for what you believe in? For that is the only \\nway you will deny him.”\\nThe question \\nhung in the air.\\nBrom finally \\nsaid, “It’s a difficult question and not one you can answer until you’re faced \\nwith it. Keep in mind that many people have died for their beliefs; it’s \\nactually quite common. The real courage is in living and suffering for what you \\nbelieve.”\\nT HEWITCH \\nANDTHEWERECAT\\nIt was late in \\nthe morning when Eragon woke. He dressed, washed his face in the basin, then \\nheld the mirror up and brushed his hair into place. Something about his \\nreflection made him stop and look closer. His face had changed since he had run \\nout of Carvahall just a short while ago. Any baby fat was gone now, stripped \\naway by traveling, sparring, and training. His cheekbones were more prominent, \\nand the line of his jaw was sharper. There was a slight cast to his eyes that, \\nwhen he looked closely, gave his face a wild, alien appearance. He held the \\nmirror at arm’s length, and his face resumed its normal semblance—but it still \\ndid not seem quite his own.\\nA little \\ndisturbed, he slung his bow and quiver across his back, then left the room. \\nBefore he had reached the end of the hall, the butler caught up with him and \\nsaid, “Sir, Neal left with my master for the castle earlier. He said that you \\ncould do whatever you want today because he will not return until this \\nevening.”\\nEragon thanked \\nhim for the message, then eagerly began exploring Teirm. For hours he wandered \\nthe streets, entering every shop that struck his fancy and chatting with \\nvarious people. Eventually he was forced back to Jeod’s by his empty stomach \\nand lack of money.\\nWhen he reached \\nthe street where the merchant lived, he stopped at the herbalist’s shop next \\ndoor. It was an unusual place for a store. The other shops were down by the \\ncity wall, not crammed between expensive houses. He tried to look in the \\nwindows, but they were covered with a thick layer of crawling plants on the \\ninterior. Curious, he went inside.\\nAt first he saw \\nnothing because the store was so dark, but then his eyes adjusted to the faint \\ngreenish light that filtered through the windows. A colorful bird with wide \\ntail feathers and a sharp, powerful beak looked at Eragon inquisitively from a \\ncage near the window. The walls were covered with plants; vines clung to the \\nceiling, obscuring all but an old chandelier, and on the floor was a large pot \\nwith a yellow flower. A collection of mortars, pestles, metal bowls, and a \\nclear crystal ball the size of Eragon’s head rested on a long counter.\\nHe walked to the \\ncounter, carefully stepping around complex machines, crates of rocks, piles of \\nscrolls, and other objects he did not recognize. The wall behind the counter \\nwas covered with drawers of every size. Some of them were no larger than his \\nsmallest finger, while others were big enough for a barrel. There was a \\nfoot-wide gap in the shelves far above.\\nA pair of red \\neyes suddenly flashed from the dark space, and a large, fierce cat leapt onto \\nthe counter. It had a lean body with powerful shoulders and oversized paws. A \\nshaggy mane surrounded its angular face; its ears were tipped with black tufts. \\nWhite fangs curved down over its jaw. Altogether, it did not look like any cat \\nEragon had ever seen. It inspected him with shrewd eyes, then flicked its tail \\ndismissively.\\nOn a whim, \\nEragon reached out with his mind and touched the cat’s consciousness. Gently, \\nhe prodded it with his thoughts, trying to make it understand that he was a \\nfriend.\\nYou don’t have \\nto do that.\\n\\nEragon looked \\naround in alarm. The cat ignored him and licked a paw.Saphira? Where are \\nyou? he asked. No one answered. Puzzled, he leaned against the counter and \\nreached for what looked like a wood rod.\\nThat wouldn’t be \\nwise.\\n\\nStop playing \\ngames, Saphira,he \\nsnapped, then picked up the rod. A shock of electricity exploded through his \\nbody, and he fell to the floor, writhing. The pain slowly faded, leaving him \\ngasping for air. The cat jumped down and looked at him.\\nYou aren’t very \\nsmart for a Dragon Rider. I did warn you. \\nYou said that!exclaimed \\nEragon. The cat yawned, then stretched and sauntered across the floor, weaving \\nits way between objects.\\nWho else? \\nBut you’re just \\na cat!he \\nobjected.\\nThe cat yowled \\nand stalked back to him. It jumped on his chest and crouched there, looking \\ndown at him with gleaming eyes. Eragon tried to sit up, but it growled, showing \\nits fangs.Do I look like other cats?\\nNo . . . \\nThen what makes \\nyou think I am one?Eragon \\nstarted to say something, but the creature dug its claws into his chest.Obviously \\nyour education has been neglected. I—to correct your mistake—am a werecat. \\nThere aren’t many of us left, but I think even a farm boy should have heard of \\nus.\\nI didn’t know \\nyou were real,said \\nEragon, fascinated. A werecat! He was indeed fortunate. They were always \\nflitting around the edges of stories, keeping to themselves and occasionally \\ngiving advice. If the legends were true, they had magical powers, lived longer \\nthan humans, and usually knew more than they told.\\nThe werecat \\nblinked lazily.Knowing is independent of being. I did not know you existed \\nbefore you bumbled in here and ruined my nap. Yet that doesn’t mean you weren’t \\nreal before you woke me.\\nEragon was lost \\nby its reasoning.I’m sorry I disturbed you.\\nI was getting up \\nanyway,it \\nsaid. It leapt back onto the counter and licked its paw.If I were you, I \\nwouldn’t hold on to that rod much longer. It’s going to shock you again in a \\nfew seconds.\\nHe hastily put \\nthe rod back where he had found it.What is it?\\nA common and \\nboring artifact, unlike myself. \\nBut what’s it \\nfor?\\n\\nDidn’t you find \\nout?The \\nwerecat finished cleaning its paw, stretched once more, then jumped back up to \\nits sleeping place. It sat down, tucked its paws under its breast, and closed \\nits eyes, purring.\\nWait,said Eragon,what’s \\nyour name?\\nOne of the \\nwerecat’s slanted eyes cracked open.I go by many names. If you are looking \\nfor my proper one, you will have to seek elsewhere. The eye closed. Eragon \\ngave up and turned to leave.However, you may call me Solembum.\\nThank you,said Eragon \\nseriously. Solembum’s purring grew louder.\\nThe door to the \\nshop swung open, letting in a beam of sunlight. Angela entered with a cloth bag \\nfull of plants. Her eyes flickered at Solembum and she looked startled. “He \\nsays you talked with him.”\\n“You can talk \\nwith him, too?” asked Eragon.\\nShe tossed her \\nhead. “Of course, but that doesn’t mean he’ll say anything back.” She set her \\nplants on the counter, then walked behind it and faced him. “He likes you. \\nThat’s unusual. Most of the time Solembum doesn’t show himself to customers. In \\nfact, he says that you show some promise, given a few years of work.”\\n“Thanks.”\\n“It’s a \\ncompliment, coming from him. You’re only the third person to come in here who \\nhas been able to speak with him. The first was a woman, many years ago; the second \\nwas a blind beggar; and now you. But I don’t run a store just so I can prattle \\non. Is there anything you want? Or did you only come in to look?”\\n“Just to look,” \\nsaid Eragon, still thinking about the werecat. “Besides, I don’t really need \\nany herbs.”\\n“That’s not all \\nI do,” said Angela with a grin. “The rich fool lords pay me for love potions \\nand the like. I never claim that they work, but for some reason they keep \\ncoming back. But I don’t think you need those chicaneries. Would you like your \\nfortune told? I do that, too, for all the rich fool ladies.”\\nEragon laughed. \\n“No, I’m afraid my fortune is pretty much unreadable. And I don’t have any \\nmoney.”\\nAngela looked at \\nSolembum curiously. “I think . . .” She gestured at the crystal ball resting on \\nthe counter. “That’s only for show anyway—it doesn’t do anything. But I do have \\n. . . Wait here; I’ll be right back.” She hurried into a room at the back of \\nthe shop.\\nShe came back, \\nbreathless, holding a leather pouch, which she set on the counter. “I haven’t \\nused these for so long, I almost forgot where they were. Now, sit across from \\nme and I’ll show you why I went to all this trouble.” Eragon found a stool and \\nsat. Solembum’s eyes glowed from the gap in the drawers.\\nAngela laid a \\nthick cloth on the counter, then poured a handful of smooth bones, each \\nslightly longer than a finger, onto it. Runes and symbols were inscribed along \\ntheir sides. “These,” she said, touching them gently, “are the knucklebones of \\na dragon. Don’t ask where I got them; it is a secret I won’t reveal. But unlike \\ntea leaves, crystal balls, or even divining cards, these have true power. They \\ndo not lie, though understanding what they say is . . . complicated. If you \\nwish, I will cast and read them for you. But understand that to know one’s fate \\ncan be a terrible thing. You must be sure of your decision.”\\nEragon looked at \\nthe bones with a feeling of dread.There lies what was once one of Saphira’s \\nkin. To know one’s fate . . . How can I make this decision when I don’t know \\nwhat lies in wait for me and whether I will like it?Ignorance is indeed bliss. \\n“Why do you offer this?” he asked.\\n“Because of \\nSolembum. He may have been rude, but the fact that he spoke to you makes you \\nspecial. Heis a werecat, after all. I offered to do this for the other \\ntwo people who talked with him. Only the woman agreed to it. Selena was her \\nname. Ah, she regretted it, too. Her fortune was bleak and painful. I don’t \\nthink she believed it—not at first.”\\nEmotion overcame \\nEragon, bringing tears to his eyes. “Selena,” he whispered to himself. His \\nmother’s name.Could it have been her? Was her destiny so horrible that she \\nhad to abandon me? “Do you remember anything about her fortune?” he asked, \\nfeeling sick.\\nAngela shook her \\nhead and sighed. “It was so long ago that the details have melted into the rest \\nof my memory, which isn’t as good as it used to be. Besides, I’ll not tell you \\nwhat I do remember. That was for her and her alone. It was sad, though; I’ve \\nnever forgotten the look on her face.”\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes and struggled to regain control of his emotions. “Why do you complain \\nabout your memory?” he asked to distract himself. “You’re not that old.”\\nDimples appeared \\non Angela’s cheeks. “I’m flattered, but don’t be deceived; I’m much older than \\nI look. The appearance of youth probably comes from having to eat my own herbs \\nwhen times are lean.”\\nSmiling, Eragon \\ntook a deep breath.If that was my mother and she could bear to have her \\nfortune told, I can too. “Cast the bones for me,” he said solemnly.\\nAngela’s face \\nbecame grave as she grasped the bones in each hand. Her eyes closed, and her \\nlips moved in a soundless murmur. Then she said powerfully,“Manin! Wyrda! \\nHugin!” and tossed the bones onto the cloth. They fell all jumbled \\ntogether, gleaming in the faint light.\\nThe words rang \\nin Eragon’s ears; he recognized them from the ancient language and realized \\nwith apprehension that to use them for magic, Angela must be a witch. She had \\nnot lied; this was a true fortunetelling. Minutes slowly passed as she studied \\nthe bones.\\nFinally, Angela \\nleaned back and heaved a long sigh. She wiped her brow and pulled out a \\nwineskin from under the counter. “Do you want some?” she asked. Eragon shook \\nhis head. She shrugged and drank deeply. “This,” she said, wiping her mouth, \\n“is the hardest reading I’ve ever done. You were right. Your future is nigh \\nimpossible to see. I’ve never known of anyone’s fate being so tangled and \\nclouded. I was, however, able to wrestle a few answers from it.”\\nSolembum jumped \\nonto the counter and settled there, watching them both. Eragon clenched his \\nhands as Angela pointed to one of the bones. “I will start here,” she said \\nslowly, “because it is the clearest to understand.”\\nThe symbol on \\nthe bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it. “Infinity or \\nlong life,” said Angela quietly. “This is the first time I have ever seen it \\ncome up in someone’s future. Most of the time it’s the aspen or the elm, both \\nsigns that a person will live a normal span of years. Whether this means that \\nyou will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life, \\nI’m not sure. Whatever it foretells, you may be sure that many years lie ahead \\nof you.”\\nNo surprises \\nthere—I am a Rider,thought \\nEragon. Was Angela only going to tell him things he already knew?\\n“Now the bones \\ngrow harder to read, as the rest are in a confused pile.” Angela touched three \\nof them. “Here the wandering path, lightning bolt, and sailing ship all lie \\ntogether—a pattern I’ve never seen, only heard of. The wandering path shows \\nthat there are many choices in your future, some of which you face even now. I \\nsee great battles raging around you, some of them fought for your sake. I see \\nthe mighty powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny. \\nCountless possible futures await you—all of them filled with blood and \\nconflict—but only one will bring you happiness and peace. Beware of losing your \\nway, for you are one of the few who are truly free to choose their own fate. \\nThat freedom is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains.”\\nThen her face \\ngrew sad. “And yet, as if to counteract that, here is the lightning bolt. It is \\na terrible omen. There is a doom upon you, but of what sort I know not. Part of \\nit lies in a death—one that rapidly approaches and will cause you much grief. \\nBut the rest awaits in a great journey. Look closely at this bone. You can see \\nhow its end rests on that of the sailing ship. That is impossible to \\nmisunderstand. Your fate will be to leave this land forever. Where you will end \\nup I know not, but you will never again stand in Alagaësia. This is \\ninescapable. It will come to pass even if you try to avoid it.”\\nHer words \\nfrightened Eragon.Another death . . . who must I lose now? His thoughts \\nimmediately went to Roran. Then he thought about his homeland.What could \\never force me to leave?And where would I go? If there are lands across the sea \\nor to the east, only the elves know of them.\\nAngela rubbed \\nher temples and breathed deeply. “The next bone is easier to read and perhaps a \\nbit more pleasant.” Eragon examined it and saw a rose blossom inscribed between \\nthe horns of a crescent moon.\\nAngela smiled \\nand said, “An epic romance is in your future, extraordinary, as the moon \\nindicates—for that is a magical symbol—and strong enough to outlast empires. I \\ncannot say if this passion will end happily, but your love is of noble birth \\nand heritage. She is powerful, wise, and beautiful beyond compare.”\\nOf noble birth,thought Eragon \\nin surprise.How could that ever happen? I have no more standing than the \\npoorest of farmers.\\n“Now for the \\nlast two bones, the tree and the hawthorn root, which cross each other \\nstrongly. I wish that this were not so—it can only mean more trouble—but \\nbetrayal is clear. And it will come from within your family.”\\n“Roran wouldn’t \\ndo that!” objected Eragon abruptly.\\n“I wouldn’t \\nknow,” said Angela carefully. “But the bones have never lied, and that is what \\nthey say.”\\nDoubt wormed \\ninto Eragon’s mind, but he tried to ignore it. What reason would there ever be \\nfor Roran to turn on him? Angela put a comforting hand on his shoulder and \\noffered him the wineskin again. This time Eragon accepted the drink, and it \\nmade him feel better.\\n“After all that, \\ndeath might be welcome,” he joked nervously.Betrayal from Roran? It couldn’t \\nhappen! It won’t!\\n“It might be,” \\nsaid Angela solemnly, then laughed slightly. “But you shouldn’t fret about what \\nhas yet to occur. The only way the future can harm us is by causing worry. I \\nguarantee that you’ll feel better once you’re out in the sun.”\\n“Perhaps.”Unfortunately, \\nhe reflected wryly,nothing she said will make sense until it has already \\nhappened. If it really does, he amended himself. “You used words of power,” \\nhe noted quietly.\\nAngela’s eyes \\nflashed. “What I wouldn’t give to see how the rest of your life plays out. You \\ncan speak to werecats, know of the ancient language, and have a most \\ninteresting future. Also, few young men with empty pockets and rough traveling \\nclothes can expect to be loved by a noblewoman. Who are you?”\\nEragon realized \\nthat the werecat must not have told Angela that he was a Rider. He almost said, \\n“Evan,” but then changed his mind and simply stated, “I am Eragon.”\\nAngela arched \\nher eyebrows. “Is that who you are or your name?” she asked.\\n“Both,” said \\nEragon with a small smile, thinking of his namesake, the first Rider.\\n“Now I’m all the \\nmore interested in seeing how your life will unfold. Who was the ragged man \\nwith you yesterday?”\\nEragon decided \\nthat one more name couldn’t hurt. “His name is Brom.”\\nA guffaw \\nsuddenly burst out of Angela, doubling her over in mirth. She wiped her eyes \\nand took a sip of wine, then fought off another attack of merriment. Finally, \\ngasping for breath, she forced out, “Oh . . . that one! I had no idea!”\\n“What is it?” \\ndemanded Eragon.\\n“No, no, don’t \\nbe upset,” said Angela, hiding a smile. “It’s only that—well, he is known by \\nthose in my profession. I’m afraid that the poor man’s doom, or future if you \\nwill, is something of a joke with us.”\\n“Don’t insult \\nhim! He’s a better man than any you could find!” snapped Eragon.\\n“Peace, peace,” \\nchided Angela with amusement. “I know that. If we meet again at the right time \\nI’ll be sure to tell you about it. But in the meantime you should—” She stopped \\nspeaking as Solembum padded between them. The werecat stared at Eragon with \\nunblinking eyes.\\nYes?Eragon asked, \\nirritated.\\nListen closely \\nand I will tell you two things. When the time comes and you need a weapon, look \\nunder the roots of the Menoa tree. Then, when all seems lost and your power is \\ninsufficient, go to the rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault \\nof Souls.\\n\\nBefore Eragon \\ncould ask what Solembum meant, the werecat walked away, waving his tail ever so \\ngracefully. Angela tilted her head, coils of dense hair shadowing her forehead. \\n“I don’t know what he said, and I don’t want to know. He spoke to you and only \\nyou. Don’t tell anyone else.”\\n“I think I have \\nto go,” said Eragon, shaken.\\n“If you want \\nto,” said Angela, smiling again. “You are welcome to stay here as long as you \\nlike, especially if you buy some of my goods. But go if you wish; I’m sure that \\nwe’ve given you enough to ponder for a while.”\\n“Yes.” Eragon \\nquickly made his way to the door. “Thank you for reading my future.”I think.\\n“You’re \\nwelcome,” said Angela, still smiling.\\nEragon exited \\nthe shop and stood in the street, squinting until his eyes adjusted to the \\nbrightness. It was a few minutes before he could think calmly about what he had \\nlearned. He started walking, his steps unconsciously quickening until he dashed \\nout of Teirm, feet flying as he headed to Saphira’s hiding place.\\nHe called to her \\nfrom the base of the cliff. A minute later she soared down and bore him up to \\nthe cliff top. When they were both safely on the ground, Eragon told her about \\nhis day.And so, he concluded,I think Brom’s right; I always seem to \\nbe where there’s trouble.\\nYou should \\nremember what the werecat told you. It’s important. \\nHow do you know?he asked \\ncuriously.\\nI’m not sure, \\nbut the names he used feel powerful.Kuthian, she said, rolling the word \\naround.No, we should not forget what he said.\\nDo you think I \\nshould tell Brom?\\n\\nIt’s your \\nchoice, but think of this: he has no right to know your future. To tell him of \\nSolembum and his words will only raise questions you may not want to answer. \\nAnd if you decided to only ask him what those words mean, he will want to know \\nwhere you learned them. Do you think you can lie convincingly to him? \\nNo,admitted Eragon.Maybe \\nI won’t say anything. Still, this might be too important to hide. They \\ntalked until there was nothing more to say. Then they sat together \\ncompanionably, watching the trees until dusk.\\nEragon hurried \\nback to Teirm and was soon knocking on Jeod’s door. “Is Neal back?” he asked \\nthe butler.\\n“Yes sir. I \\nbelieve he’s in the study right now.”\\n“Thank you,” said \\nEragon. He strode to the room and peeked inside. Brom was sitting before the \\nfire, smoking. “How did it go?” asked Eragon.\\n“Bloody awful!” \\ngrowled Brom around his pipe.\\n“So you talked \\nto Brand?”\\n“Not that it did \\nany good. Thisadministrator of trade is the worst sort of bureaucrat. He \\nabides by every rule, delights in making his own whenever it can inconvenience \\nsomeone, and at the same time believes that he’s doing good.”\\n“Then he won’t \\nlet us see the records?” asked Eragon.\\n“No,” snapped \\nBrom, exasperated. “Nothing I could say would sway him. He even refused bribes! \\nSubstantial ones, too. I didn’t think I would ever meet a noble who wasn’t \\ncorrupt. Now that I have, I find that I prefer them when they’re greedy \\nbastards.” He puffed furiously on his pipe and mumbled a steady stream of \\ncurses.\\nWhen he seemed \\nto have calmed, Eragon asked tentatively, “So, what now?”\\n“I’m going to \\ntake the next week and teach you how to read.”\\n“And after \\nthat?”\\nA smile split \\nBrom’s face. “After that, we’re going to give Brand a nasty surprise.” Eragon \\npestered him for details, but Brom refused to say more.\\nDinner was held \\nin a sumptuous dining room. Jeod sat at one end of the table, a hard-eyed Helen \\nat the other. Brom and Eragon were seated between them, which Eragon felt was a \\ndangerous place to be. Empty chairs were on either side of him, but he didn’t \\nmind the space. It helped to protect him from the glares of their hostess.\\nThe food was \\nserved quietly, and Jeod and Helen wordlessly began eating. Eragon followed \\nsuit, thinking,I’ve had cheerier meals at funerals. And he had, in \\nCarvahall. He remembered many burials that had been sad, yes, but not unduly \\nso. This was different; he could feel simmering resentment pouring from Helen \\nthroughout the dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nO FREADING ANDPLOTS\\nBrom scratched a \\nrune on parchment with charcoal, then showed it to Eragon. “This is the lettera, \\n” he said. “Learn it.”\\nWith that, \\nEragon began the task of becoming literate. It was difficult and strange and \\npushed his intellect to its limits, but he enjoyed it. Without anything else to \\ndo and with a good—if sometimes impatient—teacher, he advanced rapidly.\\nA routine was \\nsoon established. Every day Eragon got up, ate in the kitchen, then went to the \\nstudy for his lessons, where he labored to memorize the sounds of the letters \\nand the rules of writing. It got so that when he closed his eyes, letters and \\nwords danced in his mind. He thought of little else during that time.\\nBefore dinner, \\nhe and Brom would go behind Jeod’s house and spar. The servants, along with a \\nsmall crowd of wide-eyed children, would come and watch. If there was any time \\nafterward, Eragon would practice magic in his room, with the curtains securely \\nclosed.\\nHis only worry \\nwas Saphira. He visited her every evening, but it was not enough time together \\nfor either of them. During the day, Saphira spent most of her time leagues away \\nsearching for food; she could not hunt near Teirm without arousing suspicion. \\nEragon did what he could to help her, but he knew that the only solution for \\nboth her hunger and loneliness was to leave the city far behind.\\nEvery day more \\ngrim news poured into Teirm. Arriving merchants told of horrific attacks along \\nthe coast. There were reports of powerful people disappearing from their houses \\nin the night and their mangled corpses being discovered in the morning. Eragon \\noften heard Brom and Jeod discussing the events in an undertone, but they \\nalways stopped when he came near.\\nThe days passed \\nquickly, and soon a week had gone by. Eragon’s skills were rudimentary, but he \\ncould now read whole pages without asking Brom’s help. He read slowly, but he \\nknew that speed would come with time. Brom encouraged him, “No matter, you’ll \\ndo fine for what I have planned.”\\nIt was afternoon \\nwhen Brom summoned both Jeod and Eragon to the study. Brom gestured at Eragon. \\n“Now that you can help us, I think it’s time to move ahead.”\\n“What do you \\nhave in mind?” asked Eragon.\\nA fierce smile \\ndanced on Brom’s face. Jeod groaned. “I know that look; it’s what got us into \\ntrouble in the first place.”\\n“A slight \\nexaggeration,” said Brom, “but not unwarranted. Very well, this is what we’ll \\ndo. . . .”\\n\\xa0\\nWe leave tonight \\nor tomorrow,Eragon \\ntold Saphira from within his room.\\nThis is \\nunexpected. Will you be safe during this venture? \\nEragon shrugged.I \\ndon’t know. We may end up fleeing Teirm with soldiers on our heels. He felt \\nher worry and tried to reassure her.It’ll be all right. Brom and I can use \\nmagic, and we’re good fighters.\\nHe lay on the \\nbed and stared at the ceiling. His hands shook slightly, and there was a lump \\nin his throat. As sleep overcame him, he felt a wave of confusion.I don’t \\nwant to leave Teirm, he suddenly realized.The time I’ve spent here has \\nbeen—almost normal. What I would give not to keep uprooting myself. To stay \\nhere and be like everyone else would be wonderful. Then, another thought \\nraged through him,But I’ll never be able to while Saphira is around. Never.\\nDreams owned his \\nconsciousness, twisting and directing it to their whims. At times he quaked \\nwith fear; at others he laughed with pleasure. Then something changed—it was as \\nthough his eyes had been opened for the first time—and a dream came to him that \\nwas clearer than any before.\\nHe saw a young \\nwoman, bent over by sorrow, chained in a cold, hard cell. A beam of moonlight \\nshone through a barred window set high in the wall and fell on her face. A \\nsingle tear rolled down her cheek, like a liquid diamond. \\nEragon rose with \\na start and found himself crying uncontrollably before sinking back into a \\nfitful sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HIEVES IN THECASTLE\\nEragon woke from \\nhis nap to a golden sunset. Red and orange beams of light streamed into the \\nroom and fell across the bed. They warmed his back pleasantly, making him \\nreluctant to move. He dozed, but the sunlight crept off him, and he grew cold. \\nThe sun sank below the horizon, lighting the sea and sky with color.Almost \\ntime!\\nHe slung his bow \\nand quiver on his back, but left Zar’roc in the room; the sword would only slow \\nhim, and he was averse to using it. If he had to disable someone, he could use \\nmagic or an arrow. He pulled his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely.\\nHe waited \\nnervously in his room until the light faded. Then he entered the hallway and \\nshrugged so the quiver settled comfortably across his back. Brom joined him, \\ncarrying his sword and staff.\\nJeod, dressed in \\na black doublet and hose, was waiting for them outside. From his waist swung an \\nelegant rapier and a leather pouch. Brom eyed the rapier and observed, “That \\ntoad sticker is too thin for any real fighting. What will you do if someone \\ncomes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge?”\\n“Be realistic,” \\nsaid Jeod. “None of the guards has a flamberge. Besides, thistoad sticker \\nis faster than a broadsword.”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“It’s your neck.”\\nThey walked \\ncasually along the street, avoiding watchmen and soldiers. Eragon was tense and \\nhis heart pounded. As they passed Angela’s shop, a flash of movement on the \\nroof caught his attention, but he saw no one. His palm tingled. He looked at \\nthe roof again, but it was still empty.\\nBrom led them \\nalong Teirm’s outer wall. By the time they reached the castle, the sky was \\nblack. The sealed walls of the fortress made Eragon shiver. He would hate to be \\nimprisoned there. Jeod silently took the lead and strode up to the gates, \\ntrying to look at ease. He pounded on the gate and waited.\\nA small grille \\nslid open and a surly guard peered out. “Ya?” he grunted shortly. Eragon could \\nsmell rum on his breath.\\n“We need to get \\nin,” said Jeod.\\nThe guard peered \\nat Jeod closer. “Wha’ for?”\\n“The boy here \\nleft something very valuable in my office. We have to retrieve it immediately.” \\nEragon hung his head, shamefaced.\\nThe guard \\nfrowned, clearly impatient to get back to his bottle. “Ah, wha’ever,” he said, \\nswinging his arm. “Jus’ make sure ’n give ’im a good beating f’r me.”\\n“I’ll do that,” \\nassured Jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate. They entered \\nthe keep, then Brom handed the guard a few coins.\\n“Thank’ee,” \\nmumbled the man, tottering away. As soon as he was gone, Eragon pulled his bow \\nfrom its tube and strung it. Jeod quickly let them into the main part of the \\ncastle. They hurried toward their destination, listening carefully for any \\nsoldiers on patrol. At the records room, Brom tried the door. It was locked. He \\nput his hand against the door and muttered a word that Eragon did not \\nrecognize. It swung open with a faint click. Brom grabbed a torch from the wall, \\nand they darted inside, closing the door quietly.\\nThe squat room \\nwas filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls. A barred window was set \\nin the far wall. Jeod threaded his way between the racks, running his eyes over \\nthe scrolls. He halted at the back of the room. “Over here,” he said. “These \\nare the shipping records for the past five years. You can tell the date by the \\nwax seals on the corner.”\\n“So what do we \\ndo now?” asked Eragon, pleased that they had made it so far without being \\ndiscovered.\\n“Start at the \\ntop and work down,” said Jeod. “Some scrolls only deal with taxes. You can \\nignore those. Look for anything that mentions Seithr oil.” He took a length of \\nparchment from his pouch and stretched it out on the floor, then set a bottle \\nof ink and a quill pen next to it. “So we can keep track of whatever we find,” \\nhe explained.\\nBrom scooped an \\narmful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor. He sat \\nand unrolled the first one. Eragon joined him, positioning himself so he could \\nsee the door. The tedious work was especially difficult for him, as the cramped \\nscript on the scrolls was different from the printing Brom had taught him.\\nBy looking only \\nfor the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas, they winnowed out \\nmany of the scrolls. Even so, they moved down the rack slowly, recording each \\nshipment of Seithr oil as they located it.\\nIt was quiet \\noutside the room, except for the occasional watchman. Suddenly, Eragon’s neck \\nprickled. He tried to keep working, but the uneasy feeling remained. Irritated, \\nhe looked up and jerked with surprise—a small boy crouched on the windowsill. \\nHis eyes were slanted, and a sprig of holly was woven into his shaggy black \\nhair.\\nDo you need \\nhelp?asked \\na voice in Eragon’s head. His eyes widened with shock. It sounded like \\nSolembum.\\nIs that you?he asked \\nincredulously.\\nAm I someone \\nelse?\\n\\nEragon gulped \\nand concentrated on his scroll. If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are.\\nThe boy smiled \\nslightly, revealing pointed teeth.What I look like doesn’t change who I am. \\nYou don’t think I’m called a werecat for nothing, do you?\\nWhat are you \\ndoing here?Eragon \\nasked.\\nThe werecat \\ntilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an answer.That \\ndepends on what you are doing here. If you are reading those scrolls for \\nentertainment, then I suppose there isn’t any reason for my visit. But if what \\nyou are doing is unlawful and you don’t want to be discovered, I might be here \\nto warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you \\nand that this second official of the Empire has sent soldiers to search for \\nyou.\\nThank you for \\ntelling me,said \\nEragon.\\nTold you \\nsomething, did I? I suppose I did. And I suggest you make use of it. \\nThe boy stood \\nand tossed back his wild hair. Eragon asked quickly,What did you mean last \\ntime about the tree and the vault?\\nExactly what I \\nsaid.\\n\\nEragon tried to \\nask more, but the werecat vanished through the window. He announced abruptly, \\n“There are soldiers looking for us.”\\n“How do you \\nknow?” asked Brom sharply.\\n“I listened in \\non the guard. His replacement just sent men to search for us. We have to get \\nout of here. They’ve probably already discovered that Jeod’s office is empty.”\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Jeod.\\n“Yes!” said \\nEragon impatiently. “They’re on their way.”\\nBrom snatched \\nanother scroll from the rack. “No matter. We have to finish this now!” They \\nworked furiously for the next minute, scanning the records as fast as they \\ncould. As the last scroll was finished, Brom threw it back onto the rack, and \\nJeod jammed his parchment, ink, and pen into his pouch. Eragon grabbed the \\ntorch.\\nThey raced from \\nthe room and shut the door, but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of \\nsoldiers’ boots at the end of the hall. They turned to leave, but Brom hissed \\nfuriously, “Damnation! It’s not locked.” He put his hand against the door. The \\nlock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers came into view.\\n“Hey! Get away \\nfrom that door!” shouted one of them. Brom stepped back, assuming a surprised \\nexpression. The three men marched up to them. The tallest one demanded, “Why \\nare you trying to get into the records?” Eragon gripped his bow tighter and \\nprepared to run.\\n“I’m afraid we \\nlost our way.” The strain was evident in Jeod’s voice. A drop of sweat rolled \\ndown his neck.\\nThe soldier glared \\nat them suspiciously. “Check inside the room,” he ordered one of his men.\\nEragon held his \\nbreath as the soldier stepped up to the door, tried to open it, then pounded on \\nit with his mailed fist. “It’s locked, sir.”\\nThe leader \\nscratched his chin. “Ar’right, then. I don’t know what you were up to, but as \\nlong as the door’s locked, I guess you’re free to go. Come on.” The soldiers \\nsurrounded them and marched them back to the keep.\\nI can’t believe \\nit,thought \\nEragon.They’re helping us get away!\\nAt the main \\ngates, the soldier pointed and said, “Now, you walk through those and don’t try \\nanything. We’ll be watching. If you have to come back, wait until morning.”\\n“Of course,” \\npromised Jeod.\\nEragon could \\nfeel the guards’ eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the \\ncastle. The moment that the gates closed behind them, a triumphant grin \\nstretched across his face, and he jumped into the air. Brom shot him a \\ncautioning look and growled, “Walk back to the house normally. You can \\ncelebrate there.”\\nChastised, \\nEragon adopted a staid demeanor, but inside he still bubbled with energy. Once \\nthey had hurried back to the house and into the study, Eragon exclaimed, “We \\ndid it!”\\n“Yes, but now we \\nhave to figure out if it was worth the trouble,” said Brom. Jeod took a map of \\nAlagaësia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk.\\nOn the left side \\nof the map, the ocean extended to the unknown west. Along the coast stretched \\nthe Spine, an immense length of mountains. The Hadarac Desert filled the center \\nof the map—the east end was blank. Somewhere in that void hid the Varden. To \\nthe south was Surda, a small country that had seceded from the Empire after the \\nRiders’ fall. Eragon had been told that Surda secretly supported the Varden.\\nNear Surda’s \\neastern border was a mountain range labeled Beor Mountains. Eragon had heard of \\nthem in many stories—they were supposed to be ten times the height of the \\nSpine, though he privately believed that was exaggeration. The map was empty to \\nthe east of the Beors.\\nFive islands \\nrested off the coast of Surda: Nía, Parlim, Uden, Illium, and Beirland. Nía was \\nno more than an outcropping of rock, but Beirland, the largest, had a small \\ntown. Farther up, near Teirm, was a jagged island called Sharktooth. And high \\nto the north was one more island, immense and shaped like a knobby hand. Eragon \\nknew its name without even looking: Vroengard, the ancestral home of the \\nRiders—once a place of glory, but now a looted, empty shell haunted by strange \\nbeasts. In the center of Vroengard was the abandoned city of Dorú Areaba.\\nCarvahall was a \\nsmall dot at the top of Palancar Valley. Level with it, but across the plains, \\nsprawled the forest Du Weldenvarden. Like the Beor Mountains, its eastern end \\nwas unmapped. Parts of Du Weldenvarden’s western edge had been settled, but its \\nheart lay mysterious and unexplored. The forest was wilder than the Spine; the \\nfew who braved its depths often came back raving mad, or not at all.\\nEragon shivered \\nas he saw Urû’baen in the center of the Empire. King Galbatorix ruled from \\nthere with his black dragon, Shruikan, by his side. Eragon put his finger on \\nUrû’baen. “The Ra’zac are sure to have a hiding place here.”\\n“You had better \\nhope that that isn’t their only sanctuary,” said Brom flatly. “Otherwise you’ll \\nnever get near them.” He pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands.\\nJeod took the \\nparchment out of his pouch and said, “From what I saw in the records, there \\nhave been shipments of Seithr oil to every major city in the Empire over the \\npast five years. As far as I can tell, all of them might have been ordered by \\nwealthy jewelers. I’m not sure how we can narrow down the list without more \\ninformation.”\\nBrom swept a \\nhand over the map. “I think we can eliminate some cities. The Ra’zac have to \\ntravel wherever the king wants, and I’m sure he keeps them busy. If they’re \\nexpected to go anywhere at anytime, the only reasonable place for them to stay \\nis at a crossroads where they can reach every part of the country fairly \\neasily.” He was excited now and paced the room. “This crossroads has to be \\nlarge enough so the Ra’zac will be inconspicuous. It also has to have enough \\ntrade so any unusual requests—special food for their mounts, for example—will \\ngo unnoticed.”\\n“That makes \\nsense,” said Jeod, nodding. “Under those conditions, we can ignore most of the \\ncities in the north. The only big ones are Teirm, Gil’ead, and Ceunon. I know \\nthey’re not in Teirm, and I doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the \\ncoast to Narda—it’s too small. Ceunon is too isolated . . . only Gil’ead \\nremains.”\\n“The Ra’zac \\nmight be there,” conceded Brom. “It would have a certain irony.”\\n“It would at \\nthat,” Jeod acknowledged softly.\\n“What about \\nsouthern cities?” asked Eragon.\\n“Well,” said \\nJeod. “There’s obviously Urû’baen, but that’s an unlikely destination. If \\nsomeone were to die from Seithr oil in Galbatorix’s court, it would be all too \\neasy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the Empire had been buying \\nlarge amounts of it. That still leaves many others, any one of which could be \\nthe one we want.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, “but the oil wasn’t sent to all of them. The parchment only lists \\nKuasta, Dras-Leona, Aroughs, and Belatona. Kuasta wouldn’t work for the Ra’zac; \\nit’s on the coast and surrounded by mountains. Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon, \\nthough it is a center of trade. That leaves Belatona and Dras-Leona, which are \\nrather close together. Of the two, I think Dras-Leona is the likelier. It’s \\nlarger and better situated.”\\n“And that’s \\nwhere nearly all the goods of the Empire pass through at one time or another, \\nincluding Teirm’s,” said Jeod. “It would be a good place for the Ra’zac to \\nhide.”\\n“So . . . \\nDras-Leona,” said Brom as he sat down and lit his pipe. “What do the records \\nshow?”\\nJeod looked at \\nthe parchment. “Here it is. At the beginning of the year, three shipments of \\nSeithr oil were sent to Dras-Leona. Each shipment was only two weeks apart, and \\nthe records say they were all transported by the same merchant. The same thing \\nhappened last year and the year before that. I doubt any one jeweler, or even a \\ngroup of them, has the money for so much oil.”\\n“What about \\nGil’ead?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow.\\n“It doesn’t have \\nthe same access to the rest of the Empire. And,” Jeod tapped the parchment, \\n“they’ve only received the oil twice in recent years.” He thought for a moment, \\nthen said, “Besides, I think we forgot something—Helgrind.”\\nBrom nodded. “Ah \\nyes, the Dark Gates. It’s been many years since I’ve thought of it. You’re \\nright, that would make Dras-Leona perfect for the Ra’zac. I guess it’s decided, \\nthen; that’s where we’ll go.”\\nEragon sat \\nabruptly, too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind was.I thought I \\nwould be happy to resume the hunt. Instead, I feel like an abyss has opened up \\nbefore me. Dras-Leona! It’s so far away. . . .\\nThe parchment \\ncrackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map. He handed it to Brom and said, \\n“You’ll need this, I’m afraid. Your expeditions often take you into obscure \\nregions.” Nodding, Brom accepted the map. Jeod clapped him on the shoulder. “It \\ndoesn’t feel right that you will leave without me. My heart expects to go \\nalong, but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities.”\\n“I know,” said \\nBrom. “But you have a life in Teirm. It is time for the next generation to take \\nup the standard. You’ve done your part; be happy.”\\n“What of you?” \\nasked Jeod. “Does the road ever end for you?”\\nA hollow laugh \\nescaped Brom’s lips. “I see it coming, but not for a while.” He extinguished \\nhis pipe, and they left for their rooms, exhausted. Before he fell asleep, \\nEragon contacted Saphira to relate the night’s adventures.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAC OSTLYMISTAKE\\nIn the morning \\nEragon and Brom retrieved their saddlebags from the stable and prepared to \\ndepart. Jeod greeted Brom while Helen watched from the doorway. With grave \\nlooks, the two men clasped hands. “I’ll miss you, old man,” said Jeod.\\n“And you I,” \\nsaid Brom thickly. He bowed his white head and then turned to Helen. “Thank you \\nfor your hospitality; it was most gracious.” Her face reddened. Eragon thought \\nshe was going to slap him. Brom continued, unperturbed, “You have a good \\nhusband; take care of him. There are few men as brave and as determined as he \\nis. But even he cannot weather difficult times without support from those he \\nloves.” He bowed again and said gently, “Only a suggestion, dear lady.”\\nEragon watched \\nas indignation and hurt crossed Helen’s face. Her eyes flashed as she shut the \\ndoor brusquely. Sighing, Jeod ran his fingers through his hair. Eragon thanked \\nhim for all his help, then mounted Cadoc. With the last farewells said, he and \\nBrom departed.\\nAt Teirm’s south \\ngate, the guards let them through without a second glance. As they rode under \\nthe giant outer wall, Eragon saw movement in a shadow. Solembum was crouched on \\nthe ground, tail twitching. The werecat followed them with inscrutable eyes. As \\nthe city receded into the distance, Eragon asked, “What are werecats?”\\nBrom looked \\nsurprised at the question. “Why the sudden curiosity?”\\n“I heard someone \\nmention them in Teirm. They’re not real, are they?” said Eragon, pretending \\nignorance.\\n“They are quite \\nreal. During the Riders’ years of glory, they were as renowned as the dragons. \\nKings and elves kept them as companions—yet the werecats were free to do what \\nthey chose. Very little has ever been known about them. I’m afraid that their \\nrace has become rather scarce recently.”\\n“Could they use \\nmagic?” asked Eragon.\\n“No one’s sure, \\nbut they could certainly do unusual things. They always seemed to know what was \\ngoing on and somehow or another manage to get themselves involved.” Brom pulled \\nhis hood up to block a chill wind.\\n“What’s \\nHelgrind?” asked Eragon, after a moment’s thought.\\n“You’ll see when \\nwe get to Dras-Leona.”\\nWhen Teirm was \\nout of sight, Eragon reached out with his mind and called,Saphira! The force \\nof his mental shout was so strong that Cadoc flicked his ears in annoyance.\\nSaphira answered \\nand sped toward them with all of her strength. Eragon and Brom watched as a \\ndark blur rushed from a cloud, then heard a dull roar as Saphira’s wings flared \\nopen. The sun shone behind the thin membranes, turning them translucent and \\nsilhouetting the dark veins. She landed with a blast of air.\\nEragon tossed \\nCadoc’s reins to Brom. “I’ll join you for lunch.”\\nBrom nodded, but \\nseemed preoccupied. “Have a good time,” he said, then looked at Saphira and \\nsmiled. “It’s good to see you again.”\\nAnd you too. \\nEragon hopped \\nonto Saphira’s shoulders and held on tightly as she bounded upward. With the \\nwind at her tail, Saphira sliced through the air.Hold on, she warned \\nEragon, and letting out a wild bugle, she soared in a great loop. Eragon yelled \\nwith excitement as he flung his arms in the air, holding on only with his legs.\\nI didn’t know I \\ncould stay on while you did that without being strapped into the saddle,he said, grinning \\nfiercely.\\nNeither did I,admitted \\nSaphira, laughing in her peculiar way. Eragon hugged her tightly, and they flew \\na level path, masters of the sky.\\nBy noon his legs \\nwere sore from riding bareback, and his hands and face were numb from the cold \\nair. Saphira’s scales were always warm to the touch, but she could not keep him \\nfrom getting chilled. When they landed for lunch, he buried his hands in his \\nclothes and found a warm, sunny place to sit. As he and Brom ate, Eragon asked \\nSaphira,Do you mind if I ride Cadoc? He had decided to question Brom \\nfurther about his past.\\nNo, but tell me \\nwhat he says.Eragon \\nwas not surprised that Saphira knew his plans. It was nearly impossible to hide \\nanything from her when they were mentally linked. When they finished eating, she \\nflew away as he joined Brom on the trail. After a time, Eragon slowed Cadoc and \\nsaid, “I need to talk to you. I wanted to do it when we first arrived in Teirm, \\nbut I decided to wait until now.”\\n“About what?” \\nasked Brom.\\nEragon paused. \\n“There’s a lot going on that I don’t understand. For instance, who are your \\n‘friends,’ and why were you hiding in Carvahall? I trust you with my life—which \\nis why I’m still traveling with you—but I need to know more about who you are \\nand what you are doing. What did you steal in Gil’ead, and what is the tuatha \\ndu orothrim that you’re taking me through? I think that after all that’s \\nhappened, I deserve an explanation.”\\n“You \\neavesdropped on us.”\\n“Only once,” \\nsaid Eragon.\\n“I see that you \\nhave yet to learn proper manners,” said Brom grimly, tugging on his beard. \\n“What makes you think that this concerns you?”\\n“Nothing, \\nreally,” said Eragon shrugging. “Just it’s an odd coincidence that you happened \\nto be hiding in Carvahall when I found Saphira’s eggand that you also \\nknow so much dragonlore. The more I think about it, the less likely it seems. \\nThere were other clues that I mostly ignored, but they’re obvious now that I \\nlook back. Like how you knew of the Ra’zac in the first place and why they ran \\naway when you approached. And I can’t help but wonder if you had something to \\ndo with the appearance of Saphira’s egg. There’s a lot you haven’t told us, and \\nSaphira and I can’t afford to ignore anything that might be dangerous.”\\nDark lines \\nappeared on Brom’s forehead as he reined Snowfire to a halt. “You won’t wait?” \\nhe asked. Eragon shook his head mulishly. Brom sighed. “This wouldn’t be a \\nproblem if you weren’t so suspicious, but I suppose that you wouldn’t be worth \\nmy time if you were otherwise.” Eragon was unsure if he should take that as a \\ncompliment. Brom lit his pipe and slowly blew a plume of smoke into the air. \\n“I’ll tell you,” he said, “but you have to understand that I cannot reveal \\neverything.” Eragon started to protest, but Brom cut him off. “It’s not out of \\na desire to withhold information, but because I won’t give away secrets that \\naren’t mine. There are other stories woven in with this narrative. You’ll have \\nto talk with the others involved to find out the rest.”\\n“Very well. Explain \\nwhat you can,” said Eragon.\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Brom. “There are reasons for my secretiveness. I’ve tried to protect you \\nby shielding you from forces that would tear you apart. Once you know of them \\nand their purposes, you’ll never have the chance to live quietly. You will have \\nto choose sides and make a stand. Do you really want to know?”\\n“I cannot live \\nmy life in ignorance,” said Eragon quietly.\\n“A worthy goal. \\n. . . Very well: there is a war raging in Alagaësia between the Varden and the \\nEmpire. Their conflict, however, reaches far beyond any incidental armed \\nclashes. They are locked in a titanic power struggle . . . centered around \\nyou.”\\n“Me?” said \\nEragon, disbelieving. “That’s impossible. I don’t have anything to do with \\neither of them.”\\n“Not yet,” said \\nBrom, “but your very existence is the focus of their battles. The Varden and \\nthe Empire aren’t fighting to control this land or its people. Their goal is to \\ncontrol the next generation of Riders, of whom you are the first. Whoever \\ncontrols these Riders will become the undisputed master of Alagaësia.”\\nEragon tried to \\nabsorb Brom’s statements. It seemed incomprehensible that so many people would \\nbe interested in him and Saphira. No one besides Brom had thought he was that \\nimportant. The whole concept of the Empire and Varden fighting over him was too \\nabstract for him to grasp fully. Objections quickly formed in his mind. “But \\nall the Riders were killed except for the Forsworn, who joined Galbatorix. As \\nfar as I know, even those are now dead. And you told me in Carvahall that no \\none knows if there are still dragons in Alagaësia.”\\n“I lied about \\nthe dragons,” said Brom flatly. “Even though the Riders are gone, there are \\nstill three dragon eggs left—all of them in Galbatorix’s possession. Actually \\nthere are only two now, since Saphira hatched. The king salvaged the three \\nduring his last great battle with the Riders.”\\n“So there may \\nsoon be two new Riders, both of them loyal to the king?” asked Eragon with a \\nsinking feeling.\\n“Exactly,” said \\nBrom. “There is a deadly race in progress. Galbatorix is desperately trying to \\nfind the people for whom his eggs will hatch, while the Varden are employing \\nevery means to kill his candidates or steal the eggs.”\\n“But where did \\nSaphira’s egg come from? How could anyone have gotten it away from the king? \\nAnd why do you know all of this?” asked Eragon, bewildered.\\n“So many \\nquestions,” laughed Brom bitterly. “There is another chapter to all this, one \\nthat took place long before you were born. Back then I was a bit younger, though \\nperhaps not as wise. I hated the Empire—for reasons I’ll keep to myself—and \\nwanted to damage it in any way I could. My fervor led me to a scholar, Jeod, \\nwho claimed to have discovered a book that showed a secret passageway into \\nGalbatorix’s castle. I eagerly brought Jeod to the Varden—who are my \\n‘friends’—and they arranged to have the eggs stolen.”\\nThe Varden! \\n“However, \\nsomething went amiss, and our thief got only one egg. For some reason he fled \\nwith it and didn’t return to the Varden. When he wasn’t found, Jeod and I were \\nsent to bring him and the egg back.” Brom’s eyes grew distant, and he spoke in \\na curious voice. “That was the start of one of the greatest searches in \\nhistory. We raced against the Ra’zac and Morzan, last of the Forsworn and the \\nking’s finest servant.”\\n“Morzan!” \\ninterrupted Eragon. “But he was the one who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix!”And \\nthat happened so long ago! Morzan must have been ancient. It disturbed him \\nto be reminded of how long Riders lived.\\n“So?” asked \\nBrom, raising an eyebrow. “Yes, he was old, but strong and cruel. He was one of \\nthe king’s first followers and by far his most loyal. As there had been blood \\nbetween us before, the hunt for the egg turned into a personal battle. When it \\nwas located in Gil’ead, I rushed there and fought Morzan for possession. It was \\na terrible contest, but in the end I slew him. During the conflict I was \\nseparated from Jeod. There was no time to search for him, so I took the egg and \\nbore it to the Varden, who asked me to train whomever became the new Rider. I \\nagreed and decided to hide in Carvahall—which I had been to several times \\nbefore—until the Varden contacted me. I was never summoned.”\\n“Then how did \\nSaphira’s egg appear in the Spine? Was another one stolen from the king?” asked \\nEragon.\\nBrom grunted. \\n“Small chance of that. He has the remaining two guarded so thoroughly that it \\nwould be suicide to try and steal them. No, Saphira was taken from the Varden, \\nand I think I know how. To protect the egg, its guardian must have tried to \\nsend it to me with magic.\\n“The Varden \\nhaven’t contacted me to explain how they lost the egg, so I suspect that their \\nrunners were intercepted by the Empire and the Ra’zac were sent in their place. \\nI’m sure they were quite eager to find me, as I’ve managed to foil many of \\ntheir plans.”\\n“Then the Ra’zac \\ndidn’t know about me when they arrived in Carvahall,” said Eragon with wonder.\\n“That’s right,” \\nreplied Brom. “If that ass Sloan had kept his mouth shut, they might not have \\nfound out about you. Events could have turned out quite differently. In a way I \\nhave you to thank for my life. If the Ra’zac hadn’t become so preoccupied with \\nyou, they might have caught me unawares, and that would have been the end of \\nBrom the storyteller. The only reason they ran was because I’m stronger than \\nthe two of them, especially during the day. They must have planned to drug me \\nduring the night, then question me about the egg.”\\n“You sent a \\nmessage to the Varden, telling them about me?”\\n“Yes. I’m sure \\nthey’ll want me to bring you to them as soon as possible.”\\n“But you’re not \\ngoing to, are you?”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, I’m not.”\\n“Why not? Being \\nwith the Varden must be safer than chasing after the Ra’zac, especially for a \\nnew Rider.”\\nBrom snorted and \\nlooked at Eragon with fondness. “The Varden are dangerous people. If we go to \\nthem, you will be entangled in their politics and machinations. Their leaders \\nmay send you on missions just to make a point, even though you might not be \\nstrong enough for them. I want you to be well prepared before you go anywhere \\nnear the Varden. At least while we pursue the Ra’zac, I don’t have to worry \\nabout someone poisoning your water. This is the lesser of two evils. And,” he \\nsaid with a smile, “it keeps you happy while I train you. . . . Tuatha du \\norothrim is just a stage in your instruction. Iwill help you find—and \\nperhaps even kill—the Ra’zac, for they are as much my enemies as yours. But \\nthen you will have to make a choice.”\\n“And that would \\nbe . . . ?” asked Eragon warily.\\n“Whether to join \\nthe Varden,” said Brom. “If you kill the Ra’zac, the only ways for you to \\nescape Galbatorix’s wrath will be to seek the Varden’s protection, flee to \\nSurda, or plead for the king’s mercy and join his forces. Even if you don’t \\nkill the Ra’zac, you will still face this choice eventually.”\\nEragon knew the \\nbest way to gain sanctuary might be to join the Varden, but he did not want to \\nspend his entire life fighting the Empire like they did. He mulled over Brom’s \\ncomments, trying to consider them from every angle. “You still didn’t explain \\nhow you know so much about dragons.”\\n“No, I didn’t, \\ndid I?” said Brom with a crooked smile. “That will have to wait for another \\ntime.”\\nWhy me?Eragon asked \\nhimself. What made him so special that he should become a Rider? “Did you ever \\nmeet my mother?” he blurted.\\nBrom looked \\ngrave. “Yes, I did.”\\n“What was she \\nlike?”\\nThe old man \\nsighed. “She was full of dignity and pride, like Garrow. Ultimately it was her \\ndownfall, but it was one of her greatest gifts nevertheless. . . . She always \\nhelped the poor and the less fortunate, no matter what her situation.”\\n“You knew her \\nwell?” asked Eragon, startled.\\n“Well enough to \\nmiss her when she was gone.”\\nAs Cadoc plodded \\nalong, Eragon tried to recall when he had thought that Brom was just a scruffy \\nold man who told stories. For the first time Eragon understood how ignorant he \\nhad been.\\nHe told Saphira \\nwhat he had learned. She was intrigued by Brom’s revelations, but recoiled from \\nthe thought of being one of Galbatorix’s possessions. At last she said,Aren’t \\nyou glad that you didn’t stay in Carvahall? Think of all the interesting \\nexperiences you would have missed! Eragon groaned in mock distress.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the day, Eragon searched for water while Brom made dinner. He \\nrubbed his hands together for warmth as he walked in a large circle, listening \\nfor a creek or spring. It was gloomy and damp between the trees.\\nHe found a \\nstream a ways from the camp, then crouched on the bank and watched the water \\nsplash over the rocks, dipping in his fingertips. The icy mountain water \\nswirled around his skin, numbing it.It doesn’t care what happens to us, or \\nanyone else, thought Eragon. He shivered and stood.\\nAn unusual print \\non the opposing stream bank caught his attention. It was oddly shaped and very \\nlarge. Curious, he jumped across the stream and onto a rock shelf. As he \\nlanded, his foot hit a patch of damp moss. He grabbed a branch for support, but \\nit broke, and he thrust out his hand to break his fall. He felt his right wrist \\ncrack as he hit the ground. Pain lanced up his arm.\\nA steady stream \\nof curses came out from behind his clenched teeth as he tried not to howl. Half \\nblind with pain, he curled on the ground, cradling his arm.Eragon! came \\nSaphira’s alarmed cry.What happened?\\nBroke my wrist . \\n. . did something stupid . . . fell. \\nI’m coming,said Saphira.\\nNo—I can make it \\nback. Don’t . . . come. Trees too close for . . . wings. \\nShe sent him a \\nbrief image of her tearing the forest apart to get at him, then said,Hurry.\\nGroaning, he \\nstaggered upright. The print was pressed deeply into the ground a few feet \\naway. It was the mark of a heavy, nail-studded boot. Eragon instantly \\nremembered the tracks that had surrounded the pile of bodies in Yazuac. \\n“Urgal,” he spat, wishing that Zar’roc was with him; he could not use his bow \\nwith only one hand. His head snapped up, and he shouted with his mind,Saphira! \\nUrgals! Keep Brom safe.\\nEragon leapt \\nback over the stream and raced toward their camp, yanking out his hunting \\nknife. He saw potential enemies behind every tree and bush.I hope there’s \\nonly one Urgal. He burst into the camp, ducking as Saphira’s tail swung \\noverhead. “Stop. It’s me!” he yelled.\\nOops,said Saphira. \\nHer wings were folded in front of her chest like a wall.\\n“Oops?” growled \\nEragon, running to her. “You could’ve killed me! Where’s Brom?”\\n“I’m right \\nhere,” snapped Brom’s voice from behind Saphira’s wings. “Tell your crazy \\ndragon to release me; she won’t listen to me.”\\n“Let him go!” \\nsaid Eragon, exasperated. “Didn’t you tell him?”\\nNo,she said \\nsheepishly.You just said to keep him safe. She lifted her wings, and \\nBrom stepped forward angrily.\\n“I found an \\nUrgal footprint. And it’s fresh.”\\nBrom immediately \\nturned serious. “Saddle the horses. We’re leaving.” He put out the fire, but \\nEragon did not move. “What’s wrong with your arm?”\\n“My wrist is \\nbroken,” he said, swaying.\\nBrom cursed and \\nsaddled Cadoc for him. He helped Eragon onto the horse and said, “We have to \\nput a splint on your arm as soon as possible. Try not to move your wrist until \\nthen.” Eragon gripped the reins tightly with his left hand. Brom said to \\nSaphira, “It’s almost dark; you might as well fly right overhead. If Urgals \\nshow up, they’ll think twice about attacking with you nearby.”\\nThey’d better, \\nor else they won’t think again,remarked Saphira as she took off.\\nThe light was \\ndisappearing quickly, and the horses were tired, but they spurred them on \\nwithout respite. Eragon’s wrist, swollen and red, continued to throb. A mile \\nfrom the camp, Brom halted. “Listen,” he said.\\nEragon heard the \\nfaint call of a hunting horn behind them. As it fell silent, panic gripped him. \\n“They must have found where we were,” said Brom, “and probably Saphira’s \\ntracks. They will chase us now. It’s not in their nature to let prey escape.” \\nThen two horns winded. They were closer. A chill ran through Eragon. “Our only \\nchance is to run,” said Brom. He raised his head to the sky, and his face \\nblanked as he called Saphira.\\nShe rushed out \\nof the night sky and landed. “Leave Cadoc. Go with her. You’ll be safer,” \\ncommanded Brom.\\n“What about \\nyou?” Eragon protested.\\n“I’ll be fine. \\nNow go!” Unable to muster the energy to argue, Eragon climbed onto Saphira \\nwhile Brom lashed Snowfire and rode away with Cadoc. Saphira flew after him, \\nflapping above the galloping horses.\\nEragon clung to \\nSaphira as best he could; he winced whenever her movements jostled his wrist. \\nThe horns blared nearby, bringing a fresh wave of terror. Brom crashed through \\nthe underbrush, forcing the horses to their limits. The horns trumpeted in \\nunison close behind him, then were quiet.\\nMinutes passed.Where \\nare the Urgals? wondered Eragon. A horn sounded, this time in the distance. \\nHe sighed in relief, resting against Saphira’s neck, while on the ground Brom \\nslowed his headlong rush.That was close, said Eragon.\\nYes, but we \\ncannot stop until—Saphira \\nwas interrupted as a horn blasted directly underneath them. Eragon jerked in \\nsurprise, and Brom resumed his frenzied retreat. Horned Urgals, shouting with \\ncoarse voices, barreled along the trail on horses, swiftly gaining ground. They \\nwere almost in sight of Brom; the old man could not outrun them.We have to \\ndo something! exclaimed Eragon.\\nWhat? \\nLand in front of \\nthe Urgals!\\n\\nAre you crazy?demanded \\nSaphira.\\nLand! I know \\nwhat I’m doing,said \\nEragon.There isn’t time for anything else. They’re going to overtake Brom!\\nVery well.Saphira pulled \\nahead of the Urgals, then turned, preparing to drop onto the trail. Eragon \\nreached for his power and felt the familiar resistance in his mind that separated \\nhim from the magic. He did not try to breach it yet. A muscle twitched in his \\nneck.\\nAs the Urgals \\npounded up the trail, he shouted, “Now!” Saphira abruptly folded her wings and \\ndropped straight down from above the trees, landing on the trail in a spray of \\ndirt and rocks.\\nThe Urgals \\nshouted with alarm and yanked on their horses’ reins. The animals went \\nstiff-legged and collided into each other, but the Urgals quickly untangled \\nthemselves to face Saphira with bared weapons. Hate crossed their faces as they \\nglared at her. There were twelve of them, all ugly, jeering brutes. Eragon \\nwondered why they did not flee. He had thought that the sight of Saphira would \\nfrighten them away.Why are they waiting? Are they going to attack us or not?\\nHe was shocked \\nwhen the largest Urgal advanced and spat, “Our master wishes to speak with you, \\nhuman!” The monster spoke in deep, rolling gutturals.\\nIt’s a trap,warned Saphira \\nbefore Eragon could say anything.Don’t listen to him.\\nAt least let’s \\nfind out what he has to say,he reasoned, curious, but extremely \\nwary. “Who is your master?” he asked.\\nThe Urgal \\nsneered. “His name does not deserve to be given to one as low as yourself. He \\nrules the sky and holds dominance over the earth. You are no more than a stray \\nant to him. Yet he has decreed that you shall be brought before him,alive \\n. Take heart that you have become worthy of such notice!”\\n“I’ll never go \\nwith you nor any of my enemies!” declared Eragon, thinking of Yazuac. “Whether \\nyou serve Shade, Urgal, or some twisted fiend I’ve not heard of, I have no wish \\nto parley with him.”\\n“That is a grave \\nmistake,” growled the Urgal, showing his fangs. “There is no way to escape him. \\nEventually you will stand before our master. If you resist, he will fill your \\ndays with agony.”\\nEragon wondered \\nwho had the power to bring the Urgals under one banner. Was there a third great \\nforce loose in the land—along with the Empire and the Varden? “Keep your offer \\nand tell your master that the crows can eat his entrails for all I care!”\\nRage swept \\nthrough the Urgals; their leader howled, gnashing his teeth. “We’ll drag you to \\nhim, then!” He waved his arm and the Urgals rushed at Saphira. Raising his \\nright hand, Eragon barked, “Jierda!”\\nNo!cried Saphira, \\nbut it was too late.\\nThe monsters \\nfaltered as Eragon’s palm glowed. Beams of light lanced from his hand, striking \\neach of them in the gut. The Urgals were thrown through the air and smashed \\ninto trees, falling senseless to the ground.\\nFatigue suddenly \\ndrained Eragon of strength, and he tumbled off Saphira. His mind felt hazy and \\ndull. As Saphira bent over him, he realized that he might have gone too far. \\nThe energy needed to lift and throw twelve Urgals was enormous. Fear engulfed \\nhim as he struggled to stay conscious.\\nAt the edge of \\nhis vision he saw one of the Urgals stagger to his feet, sword in hand. Eragon \\ntried to warn Saphira, but he was too weak.No . . . , he thought feebly. \\nThe Urgal crept toward Saphira until he was well past her tail, then raised his \\nsword to strike her neck.No! . . . Saphira whirled on the monster, \\nroaring savagely. Her talons slashed with blinding speed. Blood spurted \\neverywhere as the Urgal was rent in two.\\nSaphira snapped \\nher jaws together with finality and returned to Eragon. She gently wrapped her \\nbloody claws around his torso, then growled and jumped into the air. The night \\nblurred into a pain-filled streak. The hypnotic sound of Saphira’s wings put \\nhim in a bleary trance: up, down; up, down; up, down. . . .\\nWhen Saphira \\neventually landed, Eragon was dimly aware of Brom talking with her. Eragon \\ncould not understand what they said, but a decision must have been reached \\nbecause Saphira took off again.\\nHis stupor \\nyielded to sleep that covered him like a soft blanket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nV ISION OFPERFECTION\\nEragon twisted under \\nthe blankets, reluctant to open his eyes. He dozed, then a fuzzy thought \\nentered his mind . . .How did I get here? Confused, he pulled the \\nblankets tighter and felt something hard on his right arm. He tried to move his \\nwrist. It zinged with pain.The Urgals! He bolted upright.\\nHe lay in a \\nsmall clearing that was empty save a small campfire heating a stew-filled pot. \\nA squirrel chattered on a branch. His bow and quiver rested alongside the \\nblankets. Attempting to stand made him grimace, as his muscles were feeble and \\nsore. There was a heavy splint on his bruised right arm.\\nWhere is \\neveryone?he \\nwondered forlornly. He tried to call Saphira, but to his alarm could not feel \\nher. Ravenous hunger gripped him, so he ate the stew. Still hungry, he looked \\nfor the saddlebags, hoping to find a chunk of bread. Neither the saddlebags nor \\nthe horses were in the clearing.I’m sure there’s a good reason for this, \\nhe thought, suppressing a surge of uneasiness.\\nHe wandered \\nabout the clearing, then returned to his blankets and rolled them up. Without \\nanything better to do, he sat against a tree and watched the clouds overhead. \\nHours passed, but Brom and Saphira did not show up.I hope nothing’s wrong.\\nAs the afternoon \\ndragged on, Eragon grew bored and started to explore the surrounding forest. \\nWhen he became tired, he rested under a fir tree that leaned against a boulder \\nwith a bowl-shaped depression filled with clear dew water.\\nEragon stared at \\nthe water and thought about Brom’s instructions for scrying.Maybe I can see \\nwhere Saphira is. Brom said that scrying takes a lot of energy, but I’m \\nstronger than he is. . . . He breathed deeply and closed his eyes. In his \\nmind he formed a picture of Saphira, making it as lifelike as possible. It was \\nmore demanding than he expected. Then he said, “Draumr kópa!”and gazed at the \\nwater.\\nIts surface \\nbecame completely flat, frozen by an invisible force. The reflections \\ndisappeared and the water became clear. On it shimmered an image of Saphira. \\nHer surroundings were pure white, but Eragon could see that she was flying. \\nBrom sat on her back, beard streaming, sword on his knees.\\nEragon tiredly \\nlet the image fade.At least they’re safe. He gave himself a few minutes \\nto recuperate, then leaned back over the water.Roran, how are you? In \\nhis mind he saw his cousin clearly. Impulsively, he drew upon the magic and \\nuttered the words.\\nThe water grew \\nstill, then the image formed on its surface. Roran appeared, sitting on an \\ninvisible chair. Like Saphira, his surroundings were white. There were new \\nlines on Roran’s face—he looked more like Garrow than ever before. Eragon held \\nthe image in place as long as he could.Is Roran in Therinsford? He’s \\ncertainly nowhere I’ve been.\\nThe strain of \\nusing magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead. He sighed and for a long \\ntime was content just to sit. Then an absurd notion struck him.What if I \\ntried to scry something I created with my imagination or saw in a dream? He \\nsmiled.Perhaps I’d be shown what my own consciousness looks like.\\nIt was too \\ntempting an idea to pass by. He knelt by the water once again.What shall I \\nlook for? He considered a few things, but discarded them all when he \\nremembered his dream about the woman in the cell.\\nAfter fixing the \\nscene in his mind, he spoke the words and watched the water intently. He \\nwaited, but nothing happened. Disappointed, he was about to release the magic \\nwhen inky blackness swirled across the water, covering the surface. The image \\nof a lone candle flickered in the darkness, brightening to illuminate a stone \\ncell. The woman from his dream was curled up on a cot in one corner. She lifted \\nher head, dark hair falling back, and stared directly at Eragon. He froze, the \\nforce of her gaze keeping him in place. Chills ran up his spine as their eyes \\nlocked. Then the woman trembled and collapsed limply.\\nThe water \\ncleared. Eragon rocked back on his heels, gasping. “This can’t be.”She \\nshouldn’t be real; I only dreamed about her! How could she know I was looking \\nat her? And how could I have scryed into a dungeon that I’ve never seen? He \\nshook his head, wondering if any of his other dreams had been visions.\\nThe rhythmic \\nthump of Saphira’s wings interrupted his thoughts. He hurried back to the \\nclearing, arriving just as Saphira landed. Brom was on her back, as Eragon had \\nseen, but his sword was now bloody. Brom’s face was contorted; the edges of his \\nbeard were stained red. “What happened?” asked Eragon, afraid that he had been \\nwounded.\\n“What happened?” \\nroared the old man. “I’ve been trying to clean up your mess!” He slashed the \\nair with the sword, flinging drops of blood along its arc. “Do you know what \\nyou did with that little trick of yours? Do you?”\\n“I stopped the \\nUrgals from catching you,” said Eragon, a pit forming in his stomach.\\n“Yes,” growled \\nBrom, “but that piece of magic nearly killed you! You’ve been sleeping for two \\ndays. There were twelve Urgals.Twelve! But that didn’t stop you from \\ntrying to throw them all the way to Teirm, now did it? What were you thinking? \\nSending a rock through each of their heads would have been the smart thing to \\ndo. But no, you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later. \\nI’ve spent the last two days trying to track them down. Even with Saphira, \\nthree escaped!”\\n“I didn’t want \\nto kill them,” said Eragon, feeling very small.\\n“It wasn’t a \\nproblem in Yazuac.”\\n“There was no \\nchoice then, and I couldn’t control the magic. This time it just seemed . . . \\nextreme.”\\n“Extreme!” cried \\nBrom. “It’s not extreme when they wouldn’t show you the same mercy. And why, oh \\nwhy, did youshow yourself to them?”\\n“You said that \\nthey had found Saphira’s footprints. It didn’t make any difference if they saw \\nme,” said Eragon defensively.\\nBrom stabbed his \\nsword into the dirt and snapped, “I said they hadprobably found her \\ntracks. We didn’t know for certain. They might have believed they were chasing \\nsome stray travelers. But why would they think that now? After all,you \\nlanded right in front of them! And since you let them live, they’re \\nscrambling around the countryside with all sorts of fantastic tales! This might \\neven get back to the Empire!” He threw his hands up. “You don’t even deserve to \\nbe called a Rider after this,boy. ” Brom yanked his sword out of the \\nground and stomped to the fire. He took a rag from inside his robe and angrily \\nbegan to clean the blade.\\nEragon was \\nstunned. He tried to ask Saphira for advice, but all she would say was,Speak \\nwith Brom.\\nHesitantly, \\nEragon made his way to the fire and asked, “Would it help if I said I was \\nsorry?”\\nBrom sighed and \\nsheathed his sword. “No, it wouldn’t. Your feelings can’t change what \\nhappened.” He jabbed his finger at Eragon’s chest. “You made some very bad \\nchoices that could have dangerous repercussions. Not the least of which is that \\nyou almost died. Died, Eragon! From now on you’re going to have to think. \\nThere’s a reason why we’re born with brains in our heads, not rocks.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nabashed. “It’s not as bad as you think, though; the Urgals already knew about \\nme. They had orders to capture me.”\\nAstonishment \\nwidened Brom’s eyes. He stuck his unlit pipe in his mouth. “No, it’s not as bad \\nas I thought. It’s worse! Saphira told me you had talked with the Urgals, but \\nshe didn’t mention this.” The words tumbled out of Eragon’s mouth as he quickly \\ndescribed the confrontation. “So they have some sort of leader now, eh?” \\nquestioned Brom.\\nEragon nodded.\\n“And you just \\ndefied his wishes, insulted him, and attacked his men?” Brom shook his head. “I \\ndidn’t think it could get any worse. If the Urgals had been killed, your rudeness \\nwould have gone unnoticed, but now it’ll be impossible to ignore. \\nCongratulations, you just made enemies with one of the most powerful beings in \\nAlagaësia.”\\n“All right, I \\nmade a mistake,” said Eragon sullenly.\\n“Yes, you did,” \\nagreed Brom, eyes flashing. “What has me worried, though, is who this Urgal \\nleader is.”\\nShivering, \\nEragon asked softly, “What happens now?”\\nThere was an \\nuncomfortable pause. “Your arm is going to take at least a couple of weeks to \\nheal. That time would be well spent forging some sense into you. I suppose this \\nis partially my fault. I’ve been teaching youhow to do things, but not \\nwhether youshould. It takes discretion, something you obviously lack. \\nAll the magic in Alagaësia won’t help you if you don’t know when to use it.”\\n“But we’re still \\ngoing to Dras-Leona, right?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom rolled his \\neyes. “Yes, we can keep looking for the Ra’zac, but even if we find them, it \\nwon’t do any good until you’ve healed.” He began unsaddling Saphira. “Are you \\nwell enough to ride?”\\n“I think so.”\\n“Good, then we \\ncan still cover a few miles today.”\\n“Where are Cadoc \\nand Snowfire?”\\nBrom pointed off \\nto the side. “Over there a ways. I picketed them where there was grass.” Eragon \\nprepared to leave, then followed Brom to the horses.\\nSaphira said pointedly,If \\nyou had explained what you were planning to do, none of this would have \\nhappened. I would have told you it was a bad idea not to kill the Urgals. I \\nonly agreed to do what you asked because I assumed it was halfway reasonable!\\nI don’t want to \\ntalk about it.\\n\\nAs you wish,she sniffed.\\nAs they rode, \\nevery bump and dip in the trail made Eragon grit his teeth with discomfort. If \\nhe had been alone, he would have stopped. With Brom there, he dared not \\ncomplain. Also, Brom started drilling him with difficult scenarios involving \\nUrgals, magic, and Saphira. The imagined fights were many and varied. Sometimes \\na Shade or other dragons were included. Eragon discovered that it was possible \\nto torture his body and mind at the same time. He got most of the questions \\nwrong and became increasingly frustrated.\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the night, Brom grumbled shortly, “It was a start.” Eragon knew \\nthat he was disappointed.\\nM ASTER \\nOF THEBLADE\\nThe next day was \\neasier on both of them. Eragon felt better and was able to answer more of \\nBrom’s questions correctly. After an especially difficult exercise, Eragon \\nmentioned his scrying of the woman. Brom pulled on his beard. “You say she was \\nimprisoned?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did you see her \\nface?” asked Brom intently.\\n“Not very \\nclearly. The lighting was bad, yet I could tell that she was beautiful. It’s \\nstrange; I didn’t have any problem seeing her eyes. And she did look at me.”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “As far as I know, it’s impossible for anyone to know if they’re being \\nscryed upon.”\\n“Do you know who \\nshe might be?” asked Eragon, surprised by the eagerness in his own voice.\\n“Not really,” \\nadmitted Brom. “If pressed, I suppose I could come up with a few guesses, but \\nnone of them would be very likely. This dream of yours is peculiar. Somehow you \\nmanaged to scry in your sleep something that you’d never seen before—without \\nsaying the words of power. Dreams do occasionally touch the spirit realm, but \\nthis is different.”\\n“Perhaps to \\nunderstand this we should search every prison and dungeon until we find the \\nwoman,” bantered Eragon. He actually thought it would be a good idea. Brom \\nlaughed and rode on.\\n\\xa0\\nBrom’s strict \\ntraining filled nearly every hour as the days slowly blended into weeks. \\nBecause of his splint, Eragon was forced to use his left hand whenever they \\nsparred. Before long he could duel as well with his left hand as he had with \\nhis right.\\nBy the time they \\ncrossed the Spine and came to the plains, spring had crept over Alagaësia, \\nsummoning a multitude of flowers. The bare deciduous trees were russet with \\nbuds, while new blades of grass began to push up between last year’s dead \\nstalks. Birds returned from their winter absence to mate and build nests.\\nThe travelers \\nfollowed the Toark River southeast, along the edge of the Spine. It grew steadily \\nas tributaries flowed into it from every side, feeding its bulging girth. When \\nthe river was over a league wide, Brom pointed at the silt islands that dotted \\nthe water. “We’re close to Leona Lake now,” he said. “It’s only about two \\nleagues away.”\\n“Do you think we \\ncan get there before nightfall?” asked Eragon.\\n“We can try.”\\nDusk soon made \\nthe trail hard to follow, but the sound of the river at their side guided them. \\nWhen the moon rose, the bright disk provided enough light to see what lay \\nahead.\\nLeona Lake \\nlooked like a thin sheet of silver beaten over the land. The water was so calm \\nand smooth it did not even seem to be liquid. Aside from a bright strip of \\nmoonlight reflecting off the surface, it was indistinguishable from the ground. \\nSaphira was on the rocky shore, fanning her wings to dry them. Eragon greeted \\nher and she said,The water is lovely—deep, cool, and clear.\\nMaybe I’ll go \\nswimming tomorrow,he \\nresponded. They set up camp under a stand of trees and were soon asleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAt dawn, Eragon \\neagerly rushed out to see the lake in daylight. A whitecapped expanse of water \\nrippled with fan-shaped patterns where wind brushed it. The pure size of it \\ndelighted him. He whooped and ran to the water.Saphira, where are you? Let’s \\nhave some fun!\\nThe moment Eragon \\nclimbed onto her, she jumped out over the water. They soared upward, circling \\nover the lake, but even at that height the opposing shore was not visible.Would \\nyou like to take a bath? Eragon casually asked Saphira.\\nShe grinned \\nwolfishly.Hold on! She locked her wings and sank to the waves, clipping \\nthe crests with her claws. The water sparkled in the sunlight as they sailed \\nover it. Eragon whooped again. Then Saphira folded her wings and dived into the \\nlake, her head and neck entering it like a lance.\\nThe water hit \\nEragon like an icy wall, knocking out his breath and almost tearing him off \\nSaphira. He held on tightly as she swam to the surface. With three strokes of \\nher feet, she breached it and sent a burst of shimmering water toward the sky. \\nEragon gasped and shook his hair as Saphira slithered across the lake, using \\nher tail as a rudder.\\nReady? \\nEragon nodded \\nand took a deep breath, tightening his arms. This time they slid gently under \\nthe water. They could see for yards through the unclouded liquid. Saphira \\ntwisted and turned in fantastic shapes, slipping through the water like an eel. \\nEragon felt as if he were riding a sea serpent of legend.\\nJust as his \\nlungs started to cry for air, Saphira arched her back and pointed her head \\nupward. An explosion of droplets haloed them as she leapt into the air, wings \\nsnapping open. With two powerful flaps she gained altitude.\\nWow! That was \\nfantastic,exclaimed \\nEragon.\\nYes,said Saphira \\nhappily.Though it’s a pity you can’t hold your breath longer.\\nNothing I can do \\nabout that,he \\nsaid, pressing water out of his hair. His clothes were drenched, and the wind \\nfrom Saphira’s wings chilled him. He pulled at his splint—his wrist itched.\\nOnce Eragon was \\ndry, he and Brom saddled the horses and started around Leona Lake in high \\nspirits while Saphira playfully dived in and out of the water.\\n\\xa0\\nBefore dinner, \\nEragon blocked Zar’roc’s edge in preparation for their usual sparring. Neither \\nhe nor Brom moved as they waited for the other to strike first. Eragon \\ninspected their surroundings for anything that might give him an advantage. A \\nstick near the fire caught his attention.\\nEragon swooped \\ndown, grabbed the stick, and hurled it at Brom. The splint got in his way, \\nthough, and Brom easily sidestepped the piece of wood. The old man rushed forward, \\nswinging his sword. Eragon ducked just as the blade whistled over his head. He \\ngrowled and tackled Brom ferociously.\\nThey pitched to \\nthe ground, each struggling to stay on top. Eragon rolled to the side and swept \\nZar’roc over the ground at Brom’s shins. Brom parried the blow with the hilt of \\nhis sword, then jumped to his feet. Twisting as he stood, Eragon attacked \\nagain, guiding Zar’roc through a complex pattern. Sparks danced from their \\nblades as they struck again and again. Brom blocked each blow, his face tight \\nwith concentration. But Eragon could tell that he was tiring. The relentless \\nhammering continued as each sought an opening in the other’s defenses.\\nThen Eragon felt \\nthe battle change. Blow by blow he gained advantage; Brom’s parries slowed and \\nhe lost ground. Eragon easily blocked a stab from Brom. Veins pulsed on the old \\nman’s forehead and cords bulged in his neck from the effort.\\nSuddenly \\nconfident, Eragon swung Zar’roc faster than ever, weaving a web of steel around \\nBrom’s sword. With a burst of speed, he smashed the flat of his blade against \\nBrom’s guard and knocked the sword to the ground. Before Brom could react, \\nEragon flicked Zar’roc up to his throat.\\nThey stood \\npanting, the red sword tip resting on Brom’s collarbone. Eragon slowly lowered \\nhis arm and backed away. It was the first time he had bested Brom without \\nresorting to trickery. Brom picked up his sword and sheathed it. Still \\nbreathing hard, he said, “We’re done for today.”\\n“But we just \\nstarted,” said Eragon, startled.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “I can teach you nothing more of the sword. Of all the fighters I’ve met, \\nonly three of them could have defeated me like that, and I doubt any of them \\ncould have done it with their left hand.” He smiled ruefully. “I may not be as \\nyoung as I used to be, but I can tell that you’re a talented and rare \\nswordsman.”\\n“Does this mean \\nwe’re not going to spar every night?” asked Eragon.\\n“Oh, you’re not \\ngetting out of it,” laughed Brom. “But we’ll go easier now. It’s not as \\nimportant if we miss a night here or there.” He wiped his brow. “Just remember, \\nif you ever have the misfortune to fight an elf—trained or not, female or \\nmale—expect to lose. They, along with dragons and other creatures of magic, are \\nmany times stronger than nature intended. Even the weakest elf could easily \\noverpower you. The same goes for the Ra’zac—they are not human and tire much \\nmore slowly than we do.”\\n“Is there any \\nway to become their equal?” asked Eragon. He sat cross-legged by Saphira.\\nYou fought well,she said. He \\nsmiled.\\nBrom seated \\nhimself with a shrug. “There are a few, but none are available to you now. \\nMagic will let you defeat all but the strongest enemies. For those you’ll need \\nSaphira’s help, plus a great deal of luck. Remember, when creatures of magic \\nactually use magic, they can accomplish things that could kill a human, because \\nof their enhanced abilities.”\\n“How do you \\nfight with magic?” asked Eragon.\\n“What do you \\nmean?”\\n“Well,” he said, \\nleaning on an elbow. “Suppose I was attacked by a Shade. How could I block his \\nmagic? Most spells take place instantaneously, which makes it impossible to \\nreact in time. And even if I could, how would I nullify an enemy’s magic? It \\nseems I would have to know my opponent’s intentionbefore he acted.” He \\npaused. “I just don’t see how it can be done. Whoever attacked first would \\nwin.”\\nBrom sighed. \\n“What you are talking about—a ‘wizards’ duel,’ if you will—is extremely \\ndangerous. Haven’t you ever wondered how Galbatorix was able to defeat all of \\nthe Riders with the help of only a dozen or so traitors?”\\n“I never thought \\nabout it,” acknowledged Eragon.\\n“There are \\nseveral ways. Some you’ll learn about later, but the main one is that \\nGalbatorix was, and still is, a master of breaking into people’s minds. You \\nsee, in a wizards’ duel there are strict rules that each side must observe or \\nelse both contestants will die. To begin with, no one uses magic until one of \\nthe participants gains access to the other’s mind.”\\nSaphira curled \\nher tail comfortably around Eragon and asked,Why wait? By the time an enemy \\nrealizes that you’ve attacked, it will be too late for him to act. Eragon \\nrepeated the question out loud.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, it won’t. If I were to suddenly use my power against you, Eragon, \\nyou would surely die, but in the brief moment before you were destroyed, there \\nwould be time for a counterattack. Therefore, unless one combatant has a death \\nwish, neither side attacks until one of them has breached the other’s \\ndefenses.”\\n“Then what \\nhappens?” Eragon inquired.\\nBrom shrugged and \\nsaid, “Once you’re inside your enemy’s mind, it’s easy enough to anticipate \\nwhat he will do and prevent it. Even with that advantage, it’s still possible \\nto lose if you don’t know how to counteract spells.”\\nHe filled and \\nlit his pipe. “And that requires extraordinarily quick thinking. Before you can \\ndefend yourself, you have to understand the exact nature of the forces directed \\nat you. If you’re being attacked with heat, you have to know whether it is \\nbeing conveyed to you through air, fire, light, or some other medium. Only once \\nthat’s known can you combat the magic by, for instance, chilling the heated \\nmaterial.”\\n“It sounds \\ndifficult.”\\n“Extremely,” \\nconfirmed Brom. A plume of smoke rose from his pipe. “Seldom can people survive \\nsuch a duel for more than a few seconds. The enormous amount of effort and \\nskill required condemns anyone without the proper training to a quick death. \\nOnce you’ve progressed, I’ll start teaching you the necessary methods. In the \\nmeantime, if you ever find yourself facing a wizards’ duel, I suggest you run \\naway as fast as you can.”\\nT HEMIRE OF \\nDRAS-LEONA\\nThey lunched at \\nFasaloft, a bustling lakeside village. It was a charming place set on a rise \\noverlooking the lake. As they ate in the hostel’s common room, Eragon listened \\nintently to the gossip and was relieved to hear no rumors of him and Saphira.\\nThe trail, now a \\nroad, had grown steadily worse over the past two days. Wagon wheels and \\niron-shod hooves had conspired to tear up the ground, making many sections \\nimpassable. An increase in travelers forced Saphira to hide during the day and \\nthen catch up with Brom and Eragon at night.\\nFor days they \\ncontinued south along Leona Lake’s vast shore. Eragon began to wonder if they \\nwould ever get around it, so he was heartened when they met men who said that \\nDras-Leona was an easy day’s ride ahead of them.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon rose \\nearly the following morning. His fingers twitched with anticipation at the \\nthought of finally finding the Ra’zac.The two of you must be careful, \\nsaid Saphira.The Ra’zac could have spies watching for travelers that fit \\nyour description.\\nWe’ll do our \\nbest to remain inconspicuous,he assured her.\\nShe lowered her \\nhead until their eyes met.Perhaps, but realize that I won’t be able to \\nprotect you as I did with the Urgals. I will be too far away to come to your \\naid, nor would I survive long in the narrow streets your kind favor. Follow \\nBrom’s lead in this hunt; he is sensible.\\nI know,he said \\nsomberly.\\nWill you go with \\nBrom to the Varden? Once the Ra’zac are killed, he will want to take you to \\nthem. And since Galbatorix will be enraged by the Ra’zac’s death, that may be \\nthe safest thing for us to do. \\nEragon rubbed \\nhis arms.I don’t want to fight the Empire all the time like the Varden do. \\nLife is more than constant war. There’ll be time to consider it once the Ra’zac \\nare gone.\\nDon’t be too \\nsure,she \\nwarned, then went to hide herself until night.\\nThe road was \\nclogged with farmers taking their goods to market in Dras-Leona. Brom and \\nEragon were forced to slow their horses and wait for wagons that blocked the \\nway.\\nAlthough they \\nsaw smoke in the distance before noon, it was another league before the city \\nwas clearly visible. Unlike Teirm, a planned city, Dras-Leona was a tangled \\nmess that sprawled next to Leona Lake. Ramshackle buildings sat on crooked \\nstreets, and the heart of the city was surrounded by a dirty, pale yellow wall \\nof daubed mud.\\nSeveral miles \\neast, a mountain of bare rock speared the sky with spires and columns, a \\ntenebrous nightmare ship. Near-vertical sides rose out of the ground like a \\njagged piece of the earth’s bone.\\nBrom pointed. “Thatis \\nHelgrind. It’s the reason Dras-Leona was originally built. People are \\nfascinated by it, even though it’s an unhealthy and malevolent thing.” He \\ngestured at the buildings inside the city’s wall. “We should go to the center \\nof the city first.”\\nAs they crept \\nalong the road to Dras-Leona, Eragon saw that the highest building within the \\ncity was a cathedral that loomed behind the walls. It was strikingly similar to \\nHelgrind, especially when its arches and flanged spires caught the light. “Who \\ndo they worship?” he asked.\\nBrom grimaced in \\ndistaste. “Their prayers go to Helgrind. It’s a cruel religion they practice. \\nThey drink human blood and make flesh offerings. Their priests often lack body \\nparts because they believe that the more bone and sinew you give up, the less \\nyou’re attached to the mortal world. They spend much of their time arguing \\nabout which of Helgrind’s three peaks is the highest and most important and \\nwhether the fourth—and lowest—should be included in their worship.”\\n“That’s \\nhorrible,” said Eragon, shuddering.\\n“Yes,” said Brom \\ngrimly, “but don’t say that to a believer. You’ll quickly lose a hand in \\n‘penance.’ ”\\nAt Dras-Leona’s \\nenormous gates, they led the horses through the crush of people. Ten soldiers \\nwere stationed on either side of the gates, casually scanning the crowd. Eragon \\nand Brom passed into the city without incident.\\nThe houses \\ninside the city wall were tall and thin to compensate for the lack of space. Those \\nnext to the wall were braced against it. Most of the houses hung over the \\nnarrow, winding streets, covering the sky so that it was hard to tell if it was \\nnight or day. Nearly all the buildings were constructed of the same rough brown \\nwood, which darkened the city even more. The air reeked like a sewer; the \\nstreets were filthy.\\nA group of \\nragged children ran between the houses, fighting over scraps of bread. Deformed \\nbeggars crouched next to the entrance gates, pleading for money. Their cries \\nfor help were like a chorus of the damned.We don’t even treat animals like \\nthis, thought Eragon, eyes wide with anger. “I won’t stay here,” he said, \\nrebelling against the sight.\\n“It gets better \\nfarther in,” said Brom. “Right now we need to find an inn and form a strategy. \\nDras-Leona can be a dangerous place to even the most cautious. I don’t want to \\nremain on the streets any longer than necessary.”\\nThey forged \\ndeeper into Dras-Leona, leaving the squalid entrance behind. As they entered \\nwealthier parts of the city, Eragon wondered,How can these people live in \\nease when the suffering around them is so obvious?\\nThey found \\nlodging at the Golden Globe, which was cheap but not decrepit. A narrow bed was \\ncrammed against one wall of the room, with a rickety table and a basin alongside \\nit. Eragon took one look at the mattress and said, “I’m sleeping on the floor. \\nThere are probably enough bugs in that thing to eat me alive.”\\n“Well, I \\nwouldn’t want to deprive them of a meal,” said Brom, dropping his bags on the \\nmattress. Eragon set his own on the floor and pulled off his bow.\\n“What now?” he \\nasked.\\n“We find food \\nand beer. After that, sleep. Tomorrow we can start looking for the Ra’zac.” \\nBefore they left the room, Brom warned, “No matter what happens, make sure that \\nyour tongue doesn’t loosen. We’ll have to leave immediately if we’re given \\naway.”\\nThe inn’s food \\nwas barely adequate, but its beer was excellent. By the time they stumbled back \\nto the room, Eragon’s head was buzzing pleasantly. He unrolled his blankets on \\nthe floor and slid under them as Brom tumbled onto the bed.\\nJust before \\nEragon fell asleep, he contacted Saphira:We’re going to be here for a few \\ndays, but this shouldn’t take as long as it did at Teirm. When we discover \\nwhere the Ra’zac are, you might be able to help us get them. I’ll talk to you \\nin the morning. Right now I’m not thinking too clearly.\\nYou’ve been \\ndrinking,came \\nthe accusing thought. Eragon considered it for a moment and had to agree that \\nshe was absolutely right. Her disapproval was clear, but all she said was,I \\nwon’t envy you in the morning.\\nNo,groaned Eragon,but \\nBrom will. He drank twice as much as I did.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT RAIL OFOIL\\nW hat was I \\nthinking?wondered Eragon in the morning. His head was pounding and his \\ntongue felt thick and fuzzy. As a rat skittered under the floor, Eragon winced \\nat the noise.\\nHow are we \\nfeeling?asked \\nSaphira smugly.\\nEragon ignored \\nher.\\nA moment later, \\nBrom rolled out of bed with a grumble. He doused his head in cold water from \\nthe basin, then left the room. Eragon followed him into the hallway. “Where are \\nyou going?” he asked.\\n“To recover.”\\n“I’ll come.” At \\nthe bar, Eragon discovered that Brom’s method of recovery involved imbibing \\ncopious amounts of hot tea and ice water and washing it all down with brandy. \\nWhen they returned to the room, Eragon was able to function somewhat better.\\nBrom belted on \\nhis sword and smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe. “The first thing we need \\nto do is ask some discreet questions. I want to find out where the Seithr oil \\nwas delivered in Dras-Leona and where it was taken from there. Most likely, \\nsoldiers or workmen were involved in transporting it. We have to find those men \\nand get one to talk.”\\nThey left the \\nGolden Globe and searched for warehouses where the Seithr oil might have been \\ndelivered. Near the center of Dras-Leona, the streets began to slant upward \\ntoward a palace of polished granite. It was built on a rise so that it towered \\nabove every building except the cathedral.\\nThe courtyard \\nwas a mosaic of mother-of-pearl, and parts of the walls were inlaid with gold. \\nBlack statues stood in alcoves, with sticks of incense smoking in their cold \\nhands. Soldiers stationed every four yards watched passersby keenly.\\n“Who lives \\nthere?” asked Eragon in awe.\\n“Marcus Tábor, \\nruler of this city. He answers only to the king and his own conscience, which \\nhasn’t been very active recently,” said Brom. They walked around the palace, \\nlooking at the gated, ornate houses that surrounded it.\\nBy midday they \\nhad learned nothing useful, so they stopped for lunch. “This city is too vast \\nfor us to comb it together,” said Brom. “Search on your own. Meet me at the \\nGolden Globe by dusk.” He glowered at Eragon from under his bushy eyebrows. \\n“I’m trusting you not to do anything stupid.”\\n“I won’t,” \\npromised Eragon. Brom handed him some coins, then strode away in the opposite \\ndirection.\\nThroughout the \\nrest of the day, Eragon talked with shopkeepers and workers, trying to be as \\npleasant and charming as he could. His questions led him from one end of the \\ncity to the other and back again. No one seemed to know about the oil. Wherever \\nhe went, the cathedral stared down at him. It was impossible to escape its tall \\nspires.\\nAt last he found \\na man who had helped ship the Seithr oil and remembered to which warehouse it \\nhad been taken. Eragon excitedly went to look at the building, then returned to \\nthe Golden Globe. It was over an hour before Brom came back, slumped with \\nfatigue. “Did you find anything?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom brushed \\nback his white hair. “I heard a great deal of interesting things today, not the \\nleast of which is that Galbatorix will visit Dras-Leona within the week.”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed Eragon.\\nBrom slouched \\nagainst the wall, the lines on his forehead deepening. “It seems that Tábor has \\ntaken a few too many liberties with his power, so Galbatorix has decided to \\ncome teach him a lesson in humility. It’s the first time the king has left \\nUrû’baen in over ten years.”\\n“Do you think he \\nknows of us?” asked Eragon.\\n“Of course heknows \\nof us, but I’m sure he hasn’t been told our location. If he had, we would \\nalready be in the Ra’zac’s grasp. However, this means that whatever we’re going \\nto do about the Ra’zac must be accomplished before Galbatorix arrives. We don’t \\nwant to be anywhere within twenty leagues of him. The one thing in our favor is \\nthat the Ra’zac are sure to be here, preparing for his visit.”\\n“I want to get \\nthe Ra’zac,” said Eragon, his fists tightening, “but not if it means fighting \\nthe king. He could probably tear me to pieces.”\\nThat seemed to \\namuse Brom. “Very good: caution. And you’re right; you wouldn’t stand a chance \\nagainst Galbatorix. Now tell me what you learned today. It might confirm what I \\nheard.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“It was mostly drivel, but I did talk with a man who knew where the oil was \\ntaken. It’s just an old warehouse. Other than that, I didn’t discover anything \\nuseful.”\\n“My day was a \\nlittle more fruitful than yours. I heard the same thing you did, so I went to \\nthe warehouse and talked with the workers. It didn’t take much cajoling before \\nthey revealed that the cases of Seithr oil are always sent from the warehouse \\nto the palace.”\\n“And that’s when \\nyou came back here,” finished Eragon.\\n“No, it’s not! \\nDon’t interrupt. After that, I went to the palace and got myself invited into \\nthe servants’ quarters as a bard. For several hours I wandered about, amusing \\nthe maids and others with songs and poems—and asking questions all the while.” \\nBrom slowly filled his pipe with tobacco. “It’s really amazing all the things \\nservants find out. Did you know that one of the earls hasthree mistresses, \\nand they all live in the same wing of the palace?” He shook his head and lit \\nthe pipe. “Aside from the fascinating tidbits, I was told, quite by accident, \\nwhere the oil is taken from the palace.”\\n“And that is . . \\n. ?” asked Eragon impatiently.\\nBrom puffed on \\nhis pipe and blew a smoke ring. “Out of the city, of course. Every full moon \\ntwo slaves are sent to the base of Helgrind with a month’s worth of provisions. \\nWhenever the Seithr oil arrives in Dras-Leona, they send it along with the \\nprovisions. The slaves are never seen again. And the one time someone followed \\nthem, he disappeared too.”\\n“I thought the \\nRiders demolished the slave trade,” said Eragon.\\n“Unfortunately, \\nit has flourished under the king’s reign.”\\n“So the Ra’zac \\nare in Helgrind,” said Eragon, thinking of the rock mountain.\\n“There or \\nsomewhere nearby.”\\n“If theyare \\nin Helgrind, they’ll be either at the bottom—and protected by a thick stone \\ndoor—or higher up where only their flying mounts, or Saphira, can reach. Top or \\nbottom, their shelter will no doubt be disguised.” He thought for a moment. “If \\nSaphira and I go flying around Helgrind, the Ra’zac are sure to see us—not to \\nmention all of Dras-Leona.”\\n“It is a \\nproblem,” agreed Brom.\\nEragon frowned. \\n“What if we took the place of the two slaves? The full moon isn’t far off. It \\nwould give us a perfect opportunity to get close to the Ra’zac.”\\nBrom tugged his \\nbeard thoughtfully. “That’s chancy at best. If the slaves are killed from a \\ndistance, we’ll be in trouble. We can’t harm the Ra’zac if they aren’t in \\nsight.”\\n“We don’t know \\nif the slaves are killed at all,” Eragon pointed out.\\n“I’m sure they \\nare,” said Brom, his face grave. Then his eyes sparkled, and he blew another \\nsmoke ring. “Still, it’s an intriguing idea. If it were done with Saphira \\nhidden nearby and a . . .” His voice trailed off. “It might work, but we’ll \\nhave to move quickly. With the king coming, there isn’t much time.”\\n“Should we go to \\nHelgrind and look around? It would be good to see the land in daylight so we \\nwon’t be surprised by any ambushes,” said Eragon.\\nBrom fingered \\nhis staff. “That can be done later. Tomorrow I’ll return to the palace and \\nfigure out how we can replace the slaves. I have to be careful not to arouse \\nsuspicion, though—I could easily be revealed by spies and courtiers who know \\nabout the Ra’zac.”\\n“I can’t believe \\nit; we actually found them,” said Eragon quietly. An image of his dead uncle \\nand burned farm flashed through his mind. His jaw tightened.\\n“The toughest \\npart is yet to come, but yes, we’ve done well,” said Brom. “If fortune smiles \\non us, you may soon have your revenge and the Varden will be rid of a dangerous \\nenemy. What comes after that will be up to you.”\\nEragon opened \\nhis mind and jubilantly told Saphira,We found the Ra’zac’s lair!\\nWhere?He quickly \\nexplained what they had discovered.Helgrind, she mused.A fitting \\nplace for them.\\nEragon agreed.When \\nwe’re done here, maybe we could visit Carvahall.\\nWhat is it you \\nwant?she \\nasked, suddenly sour.To go back to your previous life? You know that won’t \\nhappen, so stop mooning after it! At a certain point you have to decide what to \\ncommit to. Will you hide for the rest of your life, or will you help the \\nVarden? Those are the only options left to you, unless you join forces with \\nGalbatorix, which I do not and never will accept.\\nSoftly, he said, \\nIf I must choose, I cast my fate with the Varden, as you well know.\\nYes, but \\nsometimes you have to hear yourself say it.She left him to ponder her words.\\nWo RSHIPERS OFHELGRIND\\nEragon was alone \\nin the room when he woke. Scrawled onto the wall with a charcoal stick was a \\nnote that read:\\n\\xa0\\nEragon, \\n\\xa0\\nI will be gone \\nuntil late tonight. Coins for food are under the mattress. Explore the city, \\nenjoy yourself, butstay unnoticed! \\n\\xa0\\nBrom \\n\\xa0\\nP.S. Avoid the \\npalace. Don’t go anywhere without your bow! Keep it strung. \\n\\xa0\\nEragon wiped the \\nwall clean, then retrieved the money from under the bed. He slipped the bow \\nacross his back, thinking,I wish I didn’t have to go armed all the time.\\nHe left the \\nGolden Globe and ambled through the streets, stopping to observe whatever \\ninterested him. There were many intriguing stores, but none quite as exciting \\nas Angela’s herb shop in Teirm. At times he glared at the dark, claustrophobic \\nhouses and wished that he were free of the city. When he grew hungry, he bought \\na wedge of cheese and a loaf of bread and ate them, sitting on a curb.\\nLater, in a far \\ncorner of Dras-Leona, he heard an auctioneer rattling off a list of prices. \\nCurious, he headed toward the voice and arrived at a wide opening between two \\nbuildings. Ten men stood on a waist-high platform. Arrayed before them was a \\nrichly dressed crowd that was both colorful and boisterous.Where are the \\ngoods for sale? wondered Eragon.\\nThe auctioneer \\nfinished his list and motioned for a young man behind the platform to join him. \\nThe man awkwardly climbed up, chains dragging at his hands and feet. “And here \\nwe have our first item,” proclaimed the auctioneer. “A healthy male from the \\nHadarac Desert, captured just last month, and in excellent condition. Look at \\nthose arms and legs; he’s strong as a bull! He’d be perfect as a shield bearer, \\nor, if you don’t trust him for that, hard labor. But let me tell you, lords and \\nladies, that would be a waste. He’s bright as a nail, if you can get him to \\ntalk a civilized tongue!”\\nThe crowd \\nlaughed, and Eragon ground his teeth with fury. His lips started to form a word \\nthat would free the slave, and his arm, newly liberated from the splint, rose. \\nThe mark on his palm shimmered. He was about to release the magic when it \\nstruck him,He’d never get away! The slave would be caught before he \\nreached the city walls. Eragon would only make the situation worse if he tried \\nto help. He lowered his arm and quietly cursed.Think! This is how you got \\ninto trouble with the Urgals.\\nHe watched \\nhelplessly as the slave was sold to a tall, hawk-nosed man. The next slave was \\na tiny girl, no more than six years old, wrenched from the arms of her crying mother. \\nAs the auctioneer started the bidding, Eragon forced himself to walk away, \\nrigid with fury and outrage.\\nIt was several \\nblocks before the weeping was inaudible.I’d like to see a thief try to cut \\nmy purse right now, he thought grimly, almost wishing it would happen. \\nFrustrated, he punched a nearby wall, bruising his knuckles.\\nThat’s the sort \\nof thing I could stop by fighting the Empire,he realized. With Saphira by \\nmy side I could free those slaves. I’ve been graced with special powers; it \\nwould be selfish of me not to use them for the benefit of others. If I don’t, I \\nmight as well not be a Rider at all.\\nIt was a while \\nbefore he took stock of his bearings and was surprised to find himself before \\nthe cathedral. Its twisted spires were covered with statues and scrollwork. \\nSnarling gargoyles crouched along the eaves. Fantastic beasts writhed on the \\nwalls, and heroes and kings marched along their bottom edges, frozen in cold \\nmarble. Ribbed arches and tall stained-glass windows lined the cathedral’s \\nsides, along with columns of differing sizes. A lonely turret helmed the \\nbuilding like a mast.\\nRecessed in \\nshadow at the cathedral’s front was an iron-bound door inlaid with a row of \\nsilver script that Eragon recognized as the ancient language. As best he could \\ntell, it read:May thee who enter here understand thine impermanence and \\nforget thine attachments to that which is beloved.\\nThe entire \\nbuilding sent a shiver down Eragon’s spine. There was something menacing about \\nit, as if it were a predator crouched in the city, waiting for its next victim.\\nA broad row of \\nsteps led to the cathedral’s entrance. Eragon solemnly ascended them and \\nstopped before the door.I wonder if I can go in? Almost guiltily he \\npushed on the door. It swung open smoothly, gliding on oiled hinges. He stepped \\ninside.\\nThe silence of a \\nforgotten tomb filled the empty cathedral. The air was chill and dry. Bare \\nwalls extended to a vaulted ceiling that was so high Eragon felt no taller than \\nan ant. Stained-glass windows depicting scenes of anger, hate, and remorse \\npierced the walls, while spectral beams of light washed sections of the granite \\npews with transparent hues, leaving the rest in shadow. His hands were shaded a \\ndeep blue.\\nBetween the \\nwindows stood statues with rigid, pale eyes. He returned their stern gazes, \\nthen slowly trod up the center row, afraid to break the quiet. His leather \\nboots padded noiselessly on the polished stone floor.\\nThe altar was a \\ngreat slab of stone devoid of adornment. A solitary finger of light fell upon \\nit, illuminating motes of golden dust floating in the air. Behind the altar, \\nthe pipes of a wind organ pierced the ceiling and opened themselves to the \\nelements. The instrument would play its music only when a gale rocked \\nDras-Leona.\\nOut of respect, \\nEragon knelt before the altar and bowed his head. He did not pray but paid \\nhomage to the cathedral itself. The sorrows of the lives it had witnessed, as \\nwell as the unpleasantness of the elaborate pageantry that played out between \\nits walls, emanated from the stones. It was a forbidding place, bare and cold. \\nIn that chilling touch, though, came a glimpse of eternity and perhaps the \\npowers that lay there.\\nFinally Eragon \\ninclined his head and rose. Calm and grave, he whispered words to himself in \\nthe ancient language, then turned to leave. He froze. His heart jumped, \\nhammering like a drum.\\nThe Ra’zac stood \\nat the cathedral’s entrance, watching him. Their swords were drawn, keen edges \\nbloody in a crimson light. A sibilant hiss came from the smaller Ra’zac. \\nNeither of them moved.\\nRage welled up \\nin Eragon. He had chased the Ra’zac for so many weeks that the pain of their \\nmurderous deed had dulled within him. But his vengeance was at hand. His wrath \\nexploded like a volcano, fueled even more by his pent-up fury at the slaves’ \\nplight. A roar broke from his lips, echoing like a thunderstorm as he snatched \\nhis bow from his back. Deftly, he fit an arrow to the string and loosed it. Two \\nmore followed an instant later.\\nThe Ra’zac leapt \\naway from the arrows with inhuman swiftness. They hissed as they ran up the \\naisle between the pews, cloaks flapping like raven wings. Eragon reached for \\nanother arrow, but caution stayed his hand.If they knew where to find me, \\nBrom is in danger as well! I must warn him! Then, to Eragon’s horror, a \\nline of soldiers filed into the cathedral, and he glimpsed a field of uniforms \\njostling outside the doorway.\\nEragon gazed \\nhungrily at the charging Ra’zac, then swept around, searching for means of \\nescape. A vestibule to the left of the altar caught his attention. He bounded \\nthrough the archway and dashed down a corridor that led to a priory with a \\nbelfry. The patter of the Ra’zac’s feet behind him made him quicken his pace \\nuntil the hall abruptly ended with a closed door.\\nHe pounded \\nagainst it, trying to break it open, but the wood was too strong. The Ra’zac \\nwere nearly upon him. Frantic, he sucked in his breath and barked, “Jierda!” \\nWith a flash, the door splintered into pieces and fell to the floor. Eragon \\njumped into the small room and continued running.\\nHe sped through \\nseveral chambers, startling a group of priests. Shouts and curses followed him. \\nThe priory bell tolled an alarm. Eragon dodged through a kitchen, passed a pair \\nof monks, then slipped through a side door. He skidded to stop in a garden \\nsurrounded by a high brick wall devoid of handholds. There were no other exits.\\nEragon turned to \\nleave, but there was a low hiss as the Ra’zac shouldered aside the door. \\nDesperate, he rushed at the wall, arms pumping. Magic could not help him \\nhere—if he used it to break through the wall, he would be too tired to run.\\nHe jumped. Even \\nwith his arms outstretched, only his fingertips cleared the edge of the wall. \\nThe rest of his body smashed against the bricks, driving out his breath. Eragon \\ngasped and hung there, struggling not to fall. The Ra’zac prowled into the \\ngarden, swinging their heads from side to side like wolfhounds sniffing for \\nprey.\\nEragon sensed \\ntheir approach and heaved with his arms. His shoulders shrieked with pain as he \\nscrambled onto the wall and dropped to the other side. He stumbled, then \\nregained his balance and darted down an alley just as the Ra’zac leapt over the \\nwall. Galvanized, Eragon put on another burst of speed.\\nHe ran for over \\na mile before he had to stop and catch his breath. Unsure if he had lost the \\nRa’zac, he found a crowded marketplace and dived under a parked wagon.How \\ndid they find me? he wondered, panting.They shouldn’t have known where I \\nwas . . . unless something happened to Brom! He reached out with his mind \\nto Saphira and said,The Ra’zac found me. We’re all in danger! Check if \\nBrom’s all right. If he is, warn him and have him meet me at the inn. And be \\nready to fly here as fast as you can. We may need your help to escape.\\nShe was silent, then \\nsaid curtly,He’ll meet you at the inn. Don’t stop moving; you’re in great \\ndanger.\\n“Don’t I know \\nit,” muttered Eragon as he rolled out from under the wagon. He hurried back to \\nthe Golden Globe, quickly packed their belongings, saddled the horses, then led \\nthem to the street. Brom soon arrived, staff in hand, scowling dangerously. He \\nswung onto Snowfire and asked, “What happened?”\\n“I was in the \\ncathedral when the Ra’zac just appeared behind me,” said Eragon, climbing onto \\nCadoc. “I ran back as fast as possible, but they could be here at any second. \\nSaphira will join us once we’re out of Dras-Leona.”\\n“We have to get \\noutside the city walls before they close the gates, if they haven’t already,” \\nsaid Brom. “If they’re shut, it’ll be nigh impossible for us to leave. Whatever \\nyou do, don’t get separated from me.” Eragon stiffened as ranks of soldiers \\nmarched down one end of the street.\\nBrom cursed, \\nlashed Snowfire with his reins, and galloped away. Eragon bent low over Cadoc \\nand followed. They nearly crashed several times during the wild, hazardous \\nride, plunging through masses of people that clogged the streets as they neared \\nthe city wall. When the gates finally came into view, Eragon pulled on Cadoc’s \\nreins with dismay. The gates were already half closed, and a double line of \\npikemen blocked their way.\\n“They’ll cut us \\nto pieces!” he exclaimed.\\n“We have to try \\nand make it,” said Brom, his voice hard. “I’ll deal with the men, but you have \\nto keep the gates open for us.” Eragon nodded, gritted his teeth, and dug his \\nheels into Cadoc.\\nThey plowed \\ntoward the line of unwavering soldiers, who lowered their pikes toward the \\nhorses’ chests and braced the weapons against the ground. Though the horses \\nsnorted with fear, Eragon and Brom held them in place. Eragon heard the soldiers \\nshout but kept his attention on the gates inching shut.\\nAs they neared \\nthe sharp pikes, Brom raised his hand and spoke. The words struck with \\nprecision; the soldiers fell to each side as if their legs had been cut out \\nfrom under them. The gap between the gates shrank by the second. Hoping that \\nthe effort would not prove too much for him, Eragon drew on his power and \\nshouted, “Du grind huildr!”\\nA deep grating \\nsound emanated from the gates as they trembled, then ground to a stop. The \\ncrowd and guards fell silent, staring with amazement. With a clatter of the \\nhorses’ hooves, Brom and Eragon shot out from behind Dras-Leona’s wall. The \\ninstant they were free, Eragon released the gates. They shuddered, then boomed \\nshut.\\nHe swayed with \\nthe expected fatigue but managed to keep riding. Brom watched him with concern. \\nTheir flight continued through the outskirts of Dras-Leona as alarm trumpets \\nsounded on the city wall. Saphira was waiting for them by the edge of the city, \\nhidden behind some trees. Her eyes burned; her tail whipped back and forth. \\n“Go, ride her,” said Brom. “And this time stay in the air, no matter what \\nhappens to me. I’ll head south. Fly nearby; I don’t care if Saphira’s seen.” \\nEragon quickly mounted Saphira. As the ground dwindled away beneath him, he \\nwatched Brom gallop along the road.\\nAre you all \\nright?asked \\nSaphira.\\nYes,said Eragon.But \\nonly because we were very lucky.\\nA puff of smoke \\nblew from her nostrils.All the time we’ve spent searching for the Ra’zac was \\nuseless.\\nI know,he said, letting \\nhis head sag against her scales.If the Ra’zac had been the only enemies back \\nthere, I would have stayed and fought, but with all the soldiers on their side, \\nit was hardly a fair match!\\nYou understand \\nthat there will be talk of us now? This was hardly an unobtrusive escape. \\nEvading the Empire will be harder than ever.There was an edge to her voice \\nthat he was unaccustomed to.\\nI know. \\nThey flew low \\nand fast over the road. Leona Lake receded behind them; the land became dry and \\nrocky and filled with tough, sharp bushes and tall cactuses. Clouds darkened \\nthe sky. Lightning flashed in the distance. As the wind began to howl, Saphira \\nglided steeply down to Brom. He stopped the horses and asked, “What’s wrong?”\\n“The wind’s too \\nstrong.”\\n“It’s not that \\nbad,” objected Brom.\\n“It is up \\nthere,” said Eragon, pointing at the sky.\\nBrom swore and \\nhanded him Cadoc’s reins. They trotted away with Saphira following on foot, \\nthough on the ground she had difficulty keeping up with the horses.\\nThe gale grew \\nstronger, flinging dirt through the air and twisting like a dervish. They \\nwrapped scarves around their heads to protect their eyes. Brom’s robe flapped \\nin the wind while his beard whipped about as if it had a life of its own. \\nThough it would make them miserable, Eragon hoped it would rain so their tracks \\nwould be obliterated.\\nSoon darkness \\nforced them to stop. With only the stars to guide them, they left the road and \\nmade camp behind two boulders. It was too dangerous to light a fire, so they \\nate cold food while Saphira sheltered them from the wind.\\nAfter the sparse \\ndinner, Eragon asked bluntly, “How did they find us?”\\nBrom started to \\nlight his pipe, but thought better of it and put it away. “One of the palace \\nservants warned me there were spies among them. Somehow word of me and my \\nquestions must have reached Tábor . . . and through him, the Ra’zac.”\\n“We can’t go \\nback to Dras-Leona, can we?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “Not for a few years.”\\nEragon held his \\nhead between his hands. “Then should we draw the Ra’zac out? If we let Saphira \\nbe seen, they’ll come running to wherever she is.”\\n“And when they \\ndo, there will be fifty soldiers with them,” said Brom. “At any rate, this \\nisn’t the time to discuss it. Right now we have to concentrate on staying \\nalive. Tonight will be the most dangerous because the Ra’zac will be hunting us \\nin the dark, when they are strongest. We’ll have to trade watches until \\nmorning.”\\n“Right,” said \\nEragon, standing. He hesitated and squinted. His eyes had caught a flicker of \\nmovement, a small patch of color that stood out from the surrounding \\nnightscape. He stepped toward the edge of their camp, trying to see it better.\\n“What is it?” \\nasked Brom as he unrolled his blankets.\\nEragon stared \\ninto the darkness, then turned back. “I don’t know. I thought I saw something. \\nIt must have been a bird.” Pain erupted in the back of his head, and Saphira \\nroared. Then Eragon toppled to the ground, unconscious.\\nT HERA’ZAC’SREVENGE\\nAdull throbbing \\nroused Eragon. Every time blood pulsed through his head it brought a fresh wave \\nof pain. He cracked his eyes open and winced; tears rushed to his eyes as he \\nlooked directly into a bright lantern. He blinked and looked away. When he \\ntried to sit up, he realized that his hands were tied behind his back.\\nHe turned \\nlethargically and saw Brom’s arms. Eragon was relieved to see that they were \\nbound together. Why was that? He struggled to figure it out until the thought \\nsuddenly came to him,They wouldn’t tie up a dead man! But then who were \\n“they”? He swiveled his head further, then stopped as a pair of black boots \\nentered his vision.\\nEragon looked \\nup, right into the cowled face of a Ra’zac. Fear jolted through him. He reached \\nfor the magic and started to voice a word that would kill the Ra’zac, but then \\nhalted, puzzled. He could not remember the word. Frustrated, he tried again, \\nonly to feel it slip out of his grasp.\\nAbove him the \\nRa’zac laughed chillingly. “The drug is working, yesss? I think you will not be \\nbothering us again.”\\nThere was a \\nrattle off to the left, and Eragon was appalled to see the second Ra’zac fit a \\nmuzzle over Saphira’s head. Her wings were pinioned to her sides by black \\nchains; there were shackles on her legs. Eragon tried to contact her, but felt \\nnothing.\\n“She was most \\ncooperative once we threatened to kill you,” hissed the Ra’zac. Squatting by \\nthe lantern, he rummaged through Eragon’s bags, examining and discarding \\nvarious items until he removed Zar’roc. “What a pretty thing for one so . . . \\ninsignificant. Maybe I will keep it.” He leaned closer and sneered, “Or maybe, \\nif you behave, our master will let you polish it.” His moist breath smelled \\nlike raw meat.\\nThen he turned \\nthe sword over in his hands and screeched as he saw the symbol on the scabbard. \\nHis companion rushed over. They stood over the sword, hissing and clicking. At \\nlast they faced Eragon. “You will serve our master very well, yesss.”\\nEragon forced \\nhis thick tongue to form words: “If I do, I will kill you.”\\nThey chuckled \\ncoldly. “Oh no, we are too valuable. But you . . . you aredisposable. ” \\nA deep snarl came from Saphira; smoke roiled from her nostrils. The Ra’zac did \\nnot seem to care.\\nTheir attention \\nwas diverted when Brom groaned and rolled onto his side. One of the Ra’zac \\ngrabbed his shirt and thrust him effortlessly into the air. “It’sss wearing \\noff.”\\n“Give him more.”\\n“Let’sss just \\nkill him,” said the shorter Ra’zac. “He has caused us much grief.”\\nThe taller one \\nran his finger down his sword. “A good plan. But remember, the king’s \\ninstructions were to keep themalive. ”\\n“We can sssay he \\nwas killed when we captured them.”\\n“And what of \\nthisss one?” the Ra’zac asked, pointing his sword at Eragon. “If he talksss?”\\nHis companion \\nlaughed and drew a wicked dagger. “He would not dare.”\\nThere was a long \\nsilence, then, “Agreed.”\\nThey dragged \\nBrom to the center of the camp and shoved him to his knees. Brom sagged to one \\nside. Eragon watched with growing fear.I have to get free! He wrenched \\nat the ropes, but they were too strong to break. “None of that now,” said the \\ntall Ra’zac, poking him with a sword. He nosed the air and sniffed; something \\nseemed to trouble him.\\nThe other Ra’zac \\ngrowled, yanked Brom’s head back, and swept the dagger toward his exposed \\nthroat. At that very moment a low buzz sounded, followed by the Ra’zac’s howl. \\nAn arrow protruded from his shoulder. The Ra’zac nearest Eragon dropped to the \\nground, barely avoiding a second arrow. He scuttled to his wounded companion, \\nand they glared into the darkness, hissing angrily. They made no move to stop \\nBrom as he blearily staggered upright. “Get down!” cried Eragon.\\nBrom wavered, \\nthen tottered toward Eragon. As more arrows hissed into the camp from the \\nunseen attackers, the Ra’zac rolled behind some boulders. There was a lull, \\nthen arrows came from the opposite direction. Caught by surprise, the Ra’zac \\nreacted slowly. Their cloaks were pierced in several places, and a shattered \\narrow buried itself in one’s arm.\\nWith a wild cry, \\nthe smaller Ra’zac fled toward the road, kicking Eragon viciously in the side \\nas he passed. His companion hesitated, then grabbed the dagger from the ground \\nand raced after him. As he left the camp, he hurled the knife at Eragon.\\nA strange light \\nsuddenly burned in Brom’s eyes. He threw himself in front of Eragon, his mouth \\nopen in a soundless snarl. The dagger struck him with a soft thump, and he \\nlanded heavily on his shoulder. His head lolled limply.\\n“No!” screamed \\nEragon, though he was doubled over in pain. He heard footsteps, then his eyes \\nclosed and he knew no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nM URTAGH \\nFor a long while, \\nEragon was aware only of the burning in his side. Each breath was painful. It \\nfelt as though he had been the one stabbed, not Brom. His sense of time was \\nskewed; it was hard to tell if weeks had gone by, or only a few minutes. When \\nconsciousness finally came to him, he opened his eyes and peered curiously at a \\ncampfire several feet away. His hands were still tied together, but the drug \\nmust have worn off because he could think clearly again.Saphira, are you \\ninjured?\\nNo, but you and \\nBrom are.She \\nwas crouched over Eragon, wings spread protectively on either side.\\nSaphira, you \\ndidn’t make that fire, did you? And you couldn’t have gotten out of those \\nchains by yourself.\\n\\nNo. \\nI didn’t think \\nso.Eragon \\nstruggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire.\\nThe stranger, \\ndressed in battered clothes, exuded a calm, assured air. In his hands was a \\nbow, at his side a long hand-and-a-half sword. A white horn bound with silver \\nfittings lay in his lap, and the hilt of a dagger protruded from his boot. His \\nserious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair. He appeared to \\nbe a few years older than Eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller. Behind him a \\ngray war-horse was picketed. The stranger watched Saphira warily.\\n“Who are you?” \\nasked Eragon, taking a shallow breath.\\nThe man’s hands \\ntightened on his bow. “Murtagh.” His voice was low and controlled, but \\ncuriously emotional.\\nEragon pulled \\nhis hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him. He clenched his \\nteeth as his side flared with pain. “Why did you help us?”\\n“You aren’t the \\nonly enemies the Ra’zac have. I was tracking them.”\\n“You know who \\nthey are?”\\n“Yes.”\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic. He \\nhesitated, aware of Murtagh’s eyes on him, then decided it didn’t matter. \\n“Jierda!” he grunted. The ropes snapped off his wrists. He rubbed his hands to \\nget the blood flowing.\\nMurtagh sucked \\nin his breath. Eragon braced himself and tried to stand, but his ribs seared \\nwith agony. He fell back, gasping between clenched teeth. Murtagh tried to come \\nto his aid, but Saphira stopped him with a growl. “I would have helped you \\nearlier, but your dragon wouldn’t let me near you.”\\n“Her name’s Saphira,” \\nsaid Eragon tightly.Now let him by! I can’t do this alone. Besides, he saved \\nour lives. Saphira growled again, but folded her wings and backed away. \\nMurtagh eyed her flatly as he stepped forward.\\nHe grasped \\nEragon’s arm, gently pulling him to his feet. Eragon yelped and would have \\nfallen without support. They went to the fire, where Brom lay on his back. “How \\nis he?” asked Eragon.\\n“Bad,” said \\nMurtagh, lowering him to the ground. “The knife went right between his ribs. \\nYou can look at him in a minute, but first we’d better see how much damage the \\nRa’zac did to you.” He helped Eragon remove his shirt, then whistled. “Ouch!”\\n“Ouch,” agreed \\nEragon weakly. A blotchy bruise extended down his left side. The red, swollen \\nskin was broken in several places. Murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed \\nlightly. Eragon yelled, and Saphira growled a warning.\\nMurtagh glanced \\nat Saphira as he grabbed a blanket. “I think you have some broken ribs. It’s \\nhard to tell, but at least two, maybe more. You’re lucky you’re not coughing up \\nblood.” He tore the blanket into strips and bound Eragon’s chest.\\nEragon slipped \\nthe shirt back on. “Yes . . . I’m lucky.” He took a shallow breath, sidled over \\nto Brom, and saw that Murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound. \\nWith trembling fingers, he undid the bandage.\\n“I wouldn’t do \\nthat,” warned Murtagh. “He’ll bleed to death without it.”\\nEragon ignored \\nhim and pulled the cloth away from Brom’s side. The wound was short and thin, \\nbelying its depth. Blood streamed out of it. As he had learned when Garrow was \\ninjured, a wound inflicted by the Ra’zac was slow to heal.\\nHe peeled off \\nhis gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words Brom had \\ntaught him.Help me, Saphira, he implored.I am too weak to do this \\nalone.\\nSaphira crouched \\nnext to him, fixing her eyes on Brom.I am here, Eragon. As her mind \\njoined his, new strength infused his body. Eragon drew upon their combined \\npower and focused it on the words. His hand trembled as he held it over the \\nwound. “Waíse heill!” he said. His palm glowed, and Brom’s skin flowed \\ntogether, as if it had never been broken. Murtagh watched the entire process.\\nIt was over \\nquickly. As the light vanished, Eragon sat, feeling sick.We’ve never done \\nthat before, he said.\\nSaphira nodded.Together \\nwe can cast spells that are beyond either of us.\\nMurtagh examined \\nBrom’s side and asked, “Is he completely healed?”\\n“I can only mend \\nwhat is on the surface. I don’t know enough to fix whatever’s damaged inside. \\nIt’s up to him now. I’ve done all I can.” Eragon closed his eyes for a moment, \\nutterly weary. “My . . . my head seems to be floating in clouds.”\\n“You probably \\nneed to eat,” said Murtagh. “I’ll make soup.”\\nWhile Murtagh \\nfixed the meal, Eragon wondered who this stranger was. His sword and bow were \\nof the finest make, as was his horn. Either he was a thief or accustomed to \\nmoney—and lots of it.Why was he hunting the Ra’zac? What have they done to \\nmake him an enemy? I wonder if he works for the Varden?\\nMurtagh handed \\nhim a bowl of broth. Eragon spooned it down and asked, “How long has it been \\nsince the Ra’zac fled?”\\n“A few hours.”\\n“We have to go \\nbefore they return with reinforcements.”\\n“You might be \\nable to travel,” said Murtagh, then gestured at Brom, “but he can’t. You don’t \\nget up and ride away after being stabbed between the ribs.”\\nIf we make a \\nlitter, can you carry Brom with your claws like you did with Garrow?Eragon asked \\nSaphira.\\nYes, but landing \\nwill be awkward.\\n\\nAs long as it \\ncan be done.Eragon \\nsaid to Murtagh, “Saphira can carry him, but we need a litter. Can you make \\none? I don’t have the strength.”\\n“Wait here.” \\nMurtagh left the camp, sword drawn. Eragon hobbled to his bags and picked up \\nhis bow from where it had been thrown by the Ra’zac. He strung it, found his \\nquiver, then retrieved Zar’roc, which lay hidden in shadow. Last, he got a \\nblanket for the litter.\\nMurtagh returned \\nwith two saplings. He laid them parallel on the ground, then lashed the blanket \\nbetween the poles. After he carefully tied Brom to the makeshift litter, \\nSaphira grasped the saplings and laboriously took flight. “I never thought I \\nwould see a sight like that,” Murtagh said, an odd note in his voice.\\nAs Saphira \\ndisappeared into the dark sky, Eragon limped to Cadoc and hoisted himself \\npainfully into the saddle. “Thanks for helping us. You should leave now. Ride \\nas far away from us as you can. You’ll be in danger if the Empire finds you \\nwith us. We can’t protect you, and I wouldn’t see harm come to you on our \\naccount.”\\n“A pretty \\nspeech,” said Murtagh, grinding out the fire, “but where will you go? Is there \\na place nearby that you can rest in safety?”\\n“No,” admitted \\nEragon.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nglinted as he fingered the hilt of his sword. “In that case, I think I’ll \\naccompany you until you’re out of danger. I’ve no better place to be. Besides, \\nif I stay with you, I might get another shot at the Ra’zac sooner than if I \\nwere on my own. Interesting things are bound to happen around a Rider.”\\nEragon wavered, \\nunsure if he should accept help from a complete stranger. Yet he was \\nunpleasantly aware that he was too weak to force the issue either way.If \\nMurtagh proves untrustworthy, Saphira can always chase him away. “Join us \\nif you wish.” He shrugged.\\nMurtagh nodded \\nand mounted his gray war-horse. Eragon grabbed Snowfire’s reins and rode away \\nfrom the camp, into the wilderness. An oxbow moon provided wan light, but he \\nknew that it would only make it easier for the Ra’zac to track them.\\nThough Eragon \\nwanted to question Murtagh further, he kept silent, conserving his energy for riding. \\nNear dawn Saphira said,I must stop. My wings are tired and Brom needs \\nattention. I discovered a good place to stay, about two miles ahead of where \\nyou are.\\nThey found her \\nsitting at the base of a broad sandstone formation that curved out of the ground \\nlike a great hill. Its sides were pocked with caves of varying sizes. Similar \\ndomes were scattered across the land. Saphira looked pleased with herself.I \\nfound a cave that can’t be seen from the ground. It’s large enough for all of \\nus, including the horses. Follow me. She turned and climbed up the \\nsandstone, her sharp claws digging into the rock. The horses had difficulty, as \\ntheir shod hooves could not grip the sandstone. Eragon and Murtagh had to pull \\nand shove the animals for almost an hour before they managed to reach the cave.\\nThe cavern was a \\ngood hundred feet long and more than twenty feet wide, yet it had a small \\nopening that would protect them from bad weather and prying eyes. Darkness \\nswallowed the far end, clinging to the walls like mats of soft black wool.\\n“Impressive,” \\nsaid Murtagh. “I’ll gather wood for a fire.” Eragon hurried to Brom. Saphira \\nhad set him on a small rock ledge at the rear of the cave. Eragon clasped \\nBrom’s limp hand and anxiously watched his craggy face. After a few minutes, he \\nsighed and went to the fire Murtagh had built.\\nThey ate \\nquietly, then tried to give Brom water, but the old man would not drink. \\nStymied, they spread out their bedrolls and slept.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nL EGACY OF ARIDER\\nWake up, Eragon.He stirred and \\ngroaned.\\nI need your help.Something \\nis wrong!Eragon \\ntried to ignore the voice and return to sleep.\\nArise! \\nGo away,he grumbled.\\nEragon!A bellow rang in \\nthe cave. He bolted upright, fumbling for his bow. Saphira was crouched over \\nBrom, who had rolled off the ledge and was thrashing on the cave floor. His \\nface was contorted in a grimace; his fists were clenched. Eragon rushed over, \\nfearing the worst.\\n“Help me hold \\nhim down. He’s going to hurt himself!” he cried to Murtagh, clasping Brom’s \\narms. His side burned sharply as the old man spasmed. Together they restrained \\nBrom until his convulsions ceased. Then they carefully returned him to the \\nledge.\\nEragon touched \\nBrom’s forehead. The skin was so hot that the heat could be felt an inch away. \\n“Get me water and a cloth,” he said worriedly. Murtagh brought them, and Eragon \\ngently bathed Brom’s face, trying to cool him down. With the cave quiet again, \\nhe noticed the sun shining outside.How long did we sleep? he asked \\nSaphira.\\nA good while. \\nI’ve been watching Brom for most of that time. He was fine until a minute ago \\nwhen he started thrashing. I woke you once he fell to the floor. \\nHe stretched, \\nwincing as his ribs twinged painfully. A hand suddenly gripped his shoulder. \\nBrom’s eyes snapped opened and fixed a glassy stare on Eragon. “You!” he \\ngasped. “Bring me the wineskin!”\\n“Brom?” \\nexclaimed Eragon, pleased to hear him talk. “You shouldn’t drink wine; it’ll \\nonly make you worse.”\\n“Bring it, \\nboy—just bring it . . . ,” sighed Brom. His hand slipped off Eragon’s shoulder.\\n“I’ll be right \\nback—hold on.” Eragon dashed to the saddlebags and rummaged through them \\nfrantically. “I can’t find it!” he cried, looking around desperately.\\n“Here, take \\nmine,” said Murtagh, holding out a leather skin.\\nEragon grabbed \\nit and returned to Brom. “I have the wine,” he said, kneeling. Murtagh \\nretreated to the cave’s mouth so they could have privacy.\\nBrom’s next \\nwords were faint and indistinct. “Good . . .” He moved his arm weakly. “Now . . \\n. wash my right hand with it.”\\n“What—” Eragon \\nstarted to ask.\\n“No questions! I \\nhaven’t time.” Mystified, Eragon unstoppered the wineskin and poured the liquid \\nonto Brom’s palm. He rubbed it into the old man’s skin, spreading it around the \\nfingers and over the back of the hand. “More,” croaked Brom. Eragon splashed \\nwine onto his hand again. He scrubbed vigorously as a brown dye floated off \\nBrom’s palm, then stopped, his mouth agape with amazement. There on Brom’s palm \\nwas the gedwëy ignasia.\\n“You’re a \\nRider?” he asked incredulously.\\nA painful smile \\nflickered on Brom’s face. “Once upon a time that was true . . . but no more. \\nWhen I was young . . . younger than you are now, I was chosen . . . chosen by \\nthe Riders to join their ranks. While they trained me, I became friends with another \\napprentice . . . Morzan, before he was a Forsworn.” Eragon gasped—that had been \\nover a hundred years ago. “But then he betrayed us to Galbatorix . . . and in \\nthe fighting at Dorú Areaba—Vroengard’s city—my young dragon was killed. Her \\nname . . . was Saphira.”\\n“Why didn’t you \\ntell me this before?” asked Eragon softly.\\nBrom laughed. \\n“Because . . . there was no need to.” He stopped. His breathing was labored; \\nhis hands were clenched. “I am old, Eragon . . . so old. Though my dragon was \\nkilled, my life has been longer than most. You don’t know what it is to reach \\nmy age, look back, and realize that you don’t remember much of it; then to look \\nforward and know that many years still lie ahead of you. . . . After all this \\ntime I still grieve for my Saphira . . . and hate Galbatorix for what he tore \\nfrom me.” His feverish eyes drilled into Eragon as he said fiercely, “Don’t let \\nthat happen to you. Don’t! Guard Saphira with your life, for without her it’s \\nhardly worth living.”\\n“You shouldn’t \\ntalk like this. Nothing’s going to happen to her,” said Eragon, worried.\\nBrom turned his \\nhead to the side. “Perhaps I am rambling.” His gaze passed blindly over \\nMurtagh, then he focused on Eragon. Brom’s voice grew stronger. “Eragon! I \\ncannot last much longer. This . . . this is a grievous wound; it saps my \\nstrength. I have not the energy to fight it. . . . Before I go, will you take \\nmy blessing?”\\n“Everything will \\nbe all right,” said Eragon, tears in his eyes. “You don’t have to do this.”\\n“It is the way \\nof things . . . I must. Will you take my blessing?” Eragon bowed his head and \\nnodded, overcome. Brom placed a trembling hand on his brow. “Then I give it to \\nyou. May the coming years bring you great happiness.” He motioned for Eragon to \\nbend closer. Very quietly, he whispered seven words from the ancient language, \\nthen even more softly told him what they meant. “That is all I can give you. . \\n. . Use them only in great need.”\\nBrom blindly \\nturned his eyes to the ceiling. “And now,” he murmured, “for the greatest \\nadventure of all. . . .”\\nWeeping, Eragon \\nheld his hand, comforting him as best he could. His vigil was unwavering and \\nsteadfast, unbroken by food or drink. As the long hours passed, a gray pallor \\ncrept over Brom, and his eyes slowly dimmed. His hands grew icy; the air around \\nhim took on an evil humor. Powerless to help, Eragon could only watch as the \\nRa’zac’s wound took its toll.\\nThe evening \\nhours were young and the shadows long when Brom suddenly stiffened. Eragon \\ncalled his name and cried for Murtagh’s help, but they could do nothing. As a \\nbarren silence dampened the air, Brom locked his eyes with Eragon’s. Then \\ncontentment spread across the old man’s face, and a whisper of breath escaped \\nhis lips. And so it was that Brom the storyteller died.\\n\\xa0\\nWith shaking \\nfingers, Eragon closed Brom’s eyes and stood. Saphira raised her head behind \\nhim and roared mournfully at the sky, keening her lamentation. Tears rolled \\ndown Eragon’s cheeks as a sense of horrible loss bled through him. Haltingly, \\nhe said, “We have to bury him.”\\n“We might be \\nseen,” warned Murtagh.\\n“I don’t care!”\\nMurtagh \\nhesitated, then bore Brom’s body out of the cave, along with his sword and \\nstaff. Saphira followed them. “To the top,” Eragon said thickly, indicating the \\ncrown of the sandstone hill.\\n“We can’t dig a \\ngrave out of stone,” objected Murtagh.\\n“I can do it.”\\nEragon climbed \\nonto the smooth hilltop, struggling because of his ribs. There, Murtagh lay \\nBrom on the stone.\\nEragon wiped his \\neyes and fixed his gaze on the sandstone. Gesturing with his hand, he said, \\n“Moi stenr!” The stone rippled. It flowed like water, forming a body-length \\ndepression in the hilltop. Molding the sandstone like wet clay, he raised \\nwaist-high walls around it.\\nThey laid Brom \\ninside the unfinished sandstone vault with his staff and sword. Stepping back, \\nEragon again shaped the stone with magic. It joined over Brom’s motionless face \\nand flowed upward into a tall faceted spire. As a final tribute, Eragon set \\nrunes into the stone:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHERELIESBROM\\nWho was a Dragon \\nRider\\nAnd like a \\nfather\\nTo me.\\nMay his name \\nlive on in glory.\\n\\xa0\\nThen he bowed \\nhis head and mourned freely. He stood like a living statue until evening, when \\nlight faded from the land.\\nThat night he \\ndreamed of the imprisoned woman again.\\nHe could tell \\nthat something was wrong with her. Her breathing was irregular, and she \\nshook—whether from cold or pain, he did not know. In the semidarkness of the \\ncell, the only thing clearly illuminated was her hand, which hung over the edge \\nof the cot. A dark liquid dripped from the tips of her fingers. Eragon knew it \\nwas blood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD IAMONDTOMB\\nWhen Eragon woke, \\nhis eyes were gritty, his body stiff. The cave was empty except for the horses. \\nThe litter was gone; no sign of Brom remained. He walked to the entrance and \\nsat on the pitted sandstone.So the witch Angela was correct—there was a \\ndeath in my future, he thought, staring bleakly at the land. The topaz sun \\nbrought a desert heat to the early morning.\\nA tear slid down \\nhis listless face and evaporated in the sunlight, leaving a salty crust on his \\nskin. He closed his eyes and absorbed the warmth, emptying his mind. With a \\nfingernail, he aimlessly scratched the sandstone. When he looked, he saw that \\nhe had writtenWhy me?\\nHe was still \\nthere when Murtagh climbed up to the cave, carrying a pair of rabbits. Without \\na word he seated himself by Eragon. “How are you?” he asked.\\n“Very ill.”\\nMurtagh \\nconsidered him thoughtfully. “Will you recover?” Eragon shrugged. After a few \\nminutes of reflection, Murtagh said, “I dislike asking this at such a time, but \\nI must know . . . Is your Bromthe Brom? The one who helped steal a \\ndragon egg from the king, chased it across the Empire, and killed Morzan in a \\nduel? I heard you say his name, and I read the inscription you put on his \\ngrave, but I must know for certain, Was that he?”\\n“It was,” said \\nEragon softly. A troubled expression settled on Murtagh’s face. “How do you \\nknow all that? You talk about things that are secret to most, and you were \\ntrailing the Ra’zac right when we needed help. Are you one of the Varden?”\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nbecame inscrutable orbs. “I’m running away, like you.” There was restrained \\nsorrow in his words. “I do not belong to either the Varden or the Empire. Nor \\ndo I owe allegiance to any man but myself. As for my rescuing you, I will admit \\nthat I’ve heard whispered tales of a new Rider and reasoned that by following \\nthe Ra’zac I might discover if they were true.”\\n“I thought you \\nwanted to kill the Ra’zac,” said Eragon.\\nMurtagh smiled \\ngrimly. “I do, but if I had, I never would have met you.”\\nBut Brom would \\nstill be alive. . . . I wish he were here. He would know whether to trust \\nMurtagh.Eragon \\nremembered how Brom had sensed Trevor’s intentions in Daret and wondered if he \\ncould do the same with Murtagh. He reached for Murtagh’s consciousness, but his \\nprobe abruptly ran into an iron-hard wall, which he tried to circumvent. \\nMurtagh’s entire mind was fortified.How did he learn to do that? Brom said \\nthat few people, if any, could keep others out of their mind without training. \\nSo who is Murtagh to have this ability ? Pensive and lonely, Eragon asked, \\n“Where is Saphira?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Murtagh. “She followed me for a time when I went hunting, then flew off on \\nher own. I haven’t seen her since before noon.” Eragon rocked onto his feet and \\nreturned to the cave. Murtagh followed. “What are you going to do now?”\\n“I’m not sure.”And \\nI don’t want to think about it either. He rolled up his blankets and tied \\nthem to Cadoc’s saddlebags. His ribs hurt. Murtagh went to prepare the rabbits. \\nAs Eragon shifted things in his bags, he uncovered Zar’roc. The red sheath \\nglinted brightly. He took out the sword . . . weighed it in his hands.\\nHe had never \\ncarried Zar’roc nor used it in combat—except when he and Brom had \\nsparred—because he had not wanted people to see it. That concerned Eragon no \\nmore. The Ra’zac had seemed surprised and frightened by the sword; that was \\nmore than enough reason for him to wear it. With a shudder he pulled off his \\nbow and belted on Zar’roc.From this moment on, I’ll live by the sword. Let \\nthe whole world see what I am. I have no fear. I am a Rider now, fully and \\ncompletely.\\nHe sorted \\nthrough Brom’s bags but found only clothes, a few odd items, and a small pouch \\nof coins. Eragon took the map of Alagaësia and put the bags away, then crouched \\nby the fire. Murtagh’s eyes narrowed as he looked up from the rabbit he was \\nskinning. “That sword. May I see it?” he asked, wiping his hands.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, reluctant to relinquish the weapon for even a moment, then nodded. \\nMurtagh examined the symbol on the blade intently. His face darkened. “Where \\ndid you get this?”\\n“Brom gave it to \\nme. Why?”\\nMurtagh shoved \\nthe sword back and crossed his arms angrily. He was breathing hard. “That \\nsword,” he said with emotion, “was once as well known as its owner. The last \\nRider to carry it was Morzan—a brutal, savage man. I thought you were a foe of \\nthe Empire, yet here I find you bearing one of the Forsworn’s bloody swords!”\\nEragon stared at \\nZar’roc with shock. He realized that Brom must have taken it from Morzan after \\nthey fought in Gil’ead. “Brom never told me where it came from,” he said \\ntruthfully. “I had no idea it was Morzan’s.”\\n“He never told \\nyou?” asked Murtagh, a note of disbelief in his voice. Eragon shook his head. \\n“That’s strange. I can think of no reason for him to have concealed it.”\\n“Neither can I. \\nBut then, he kept many secrets,” said Eragon. It felt unsettling to hold the \\nsword of the man who had betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix.This blade \\nprobably killed many Riders in its time, he thought with revulsion.And \\nworse, dragons! “Even so, I’m going to carry it. I don’t have a sword of my \\nown. Until such time as I get one, I’ll use Zar’roc.”\\nMurtagh flinched \\nas Eragon said the name. “It’s your choice,” he said. He returned to skinning, \\nkeeping his gaze focused downward.\\nWhen the meal \\nwas ready, Eragon ate slowly, though he was quite hungry. The hot food made him \\nfeel better. As they scraped out their bowls, he said, “I have to sell my \\nhorse.”\\n“Why not \\nBrom’s?” asked Murtagh. He seemed to have gotten over his bad temper.\\n“Snowfire? \\nBecause Brom promised to take care of him. Since he . . . isn’t around, I’ll do \\nit for him.”\\nMurtagh set his \\nbowl on his lap. “If that’s what you want, I’m sure we can find a buyer in some \\ntown or village.”\\n“We?” asked \\nEragon.\\nMurtagh looked \\nat him sideways in a calculating way. “You won’t want to stay here for much \\nlonger. If the Ra’zac are nearby, Brom’s tomb will be like a beacon for them.” \\nEragon had not thought of that. “And your ribs are going to take time to heal. \\nI know you can defend yourself with magic, but you need a companion who can \\nlift things and use a sword. I’m asking to travel with you, at least for the \\ntime being. But I must warn you, the Empire is searching for me. There’ll be \\nblood over it eventually.”\\nEragon laughed \\nweakly and found himself crying because it hurt so much. Once his breath was \\nback, he said, “I don’t care if the entire army is searching for you. You’re \\nright. I do need help. I would be glad to have you along, though I have to talk \\nto Saphira about it. But I have to warnyou, Galbatorix justmight \\nsend the entire army after me. You won’t be any safer with Saphira and me than \\nif you were on your own.”\\n“I know that,” \\nsaid Murtagh with a quick grin. “But all the same, it won’t stop me.”\\n“Good.” Eragon \\nsmiled with gratitude.\\nWhile they \\nspoke, Saphira crawled into the cave and greeted Eragon. She was glad to see \\nhim, but there was deep sadness in her thoughts and words. She laid her big \\nblue head on the floor and asked,Are you well again?\\nNot quite. \\nI miss the old \\none.\\n\\nAs do I . . . I \\nnever suspected that he was a Rider. Brom! He really was an old man—as old as \\nthe Forsworn. Everything he taught me about magic he must have learned from the \\nRiders themselves.\\n\\nSaphira shifted \\nslightly.I knew what he was the moment he touched me at your farm.\\nAnd you didn’t \\ntell me? Why?\\n\\nHe asked me not \\nto, she \\nsaid simply.\\nEragon decided \\nnot to make an issue of it. Saphira never meant to hurt him. Brom kept more \\nthan that secret,he told her, then explained about Zar’roc and Murtagh’s \\nreaction to it.I understand now why Brom didn’t explain Zar’roc’s origins \\nwhen he gave it to me. If he had, I probably would have run away from him at \\nthe first opportunity.\\nYou would do \\nwell to rid yourself of that sword,she said with distaste.I know it’s a \\npeerless weapon, but you would be better off with a normal blade rather than \\nMorzan’s butchery tool.\\nPerhaps. \\nSaphira, where does our path go from here? Murtagh offered to come with us. I \\ndon’t know his past, but he seems honest enough. Should we go to the Varden \\nnow? Only I don’t know how to find them. Brom never told us. \\nHe told me,said Saphira.\\nEragon grew \\nangry.Why did he trust you, but not me, with all this knowledge?\\nHer scales \\nrustled over the dry rock as she stood above him, eyes profound.After we \\nleft Teirm and were attacked by the Urgals, he told me many things, some of \\nwhich I will not speak of unless necessary. He was concerned about his own \\ndeath and what would happen to you after it. One fact he imparted to me was the \\nname of a man, Dormnad, who lives in Gil’ead. He can help us find the Varden. \\nBrom also wanted you to know that of all the people in Alagaësia, he believed \\nyou were the best suited to inherit the Riders’ legacy.\\nTears welled in \\nEragon’s eyes. This was the highest praise he could have ever received from \\nBrom.A responsibility I will bear honorably.\\nGood. \\nWe will go to \\nGil’ead, then,stated \\nEragon, strength and purpose returning to him.And what of Murtagh? Do you \\nthink he should come with us?\\nWe owe him our \\nlives,said \\nSaphira.But even if that weren’t so, he has seen both you and me. We should \\nkeep him close so he doesn’t furnish the Empire with our location and descriptions, \\nwillingly or not.\\nHe agreed with \\nher, then told Saphira about his dream.What I saw disturbed me. I feel that \\ntime is running out for her; something dreadful is going to happen soon. She’s \\nin mortal danger—I’m sure of it—but I don’t know how to find her! She could be \\nanywhere.\\nWhat does your \\nheart say?asked \\nSaphira.\\nMy heart died a \\nwhile back,said \\nEragon with a hint of black humor.However, I think we should go north to \\nGil’ead. With any luck, one of the towns or cities along our path is where this \\nwoman is being held. I’m afraid that my next dream of her will show a grave. I \\ncouldn’t stand that.\\nWhy? \\nI’m not sure,he said, \\nshrugging.It’s just that when I see her, I feel as if she’s precious and \\nshouldn’t be lost. . . . It’s very strange. Saphira opened her long mouth \\nand laughed silently, fangs gleaming.What is it? snapped Eragon. She \\nshook her head and quietly padded away.\\nEragon grumbled \\nto himself, then told Murtagh what they had decided. Murtagh said, “If you find \\nthis Dormnad and then continue on to the Varden, I will leave you. Encountering \\nthe Varden would be as dangerous for me as walking unarmed into Urû’baen with a \\nfanfare of trumpets to announce my arrival.”\\n“We won’t have \\nto part anytime soon,” said Eragon. “It’s a long way to Gil’ead.” His voice \\ncracked slightly, and he squinted at the sun to distract himself. “We should \\nleave before the day grows any older.”\\n“Are you strong \\nenough to travel?” asked Murtagh, frowning.\\n“I have to do \\nsomething or I’ll go crazy,” said Eragon brusquely. “Sparring, practicing \\nmagic, or sitting around twiddling my thumbs aren’t good options right now, so \\nI choose to ride.”\\nThey doused the \\nfire, packed, and led the horses out of the cave. Eragon handed Cadoc’s and \\nSnowfire’s reins to Murtagh, saying, “Go on, I’ll be right down.” Murtagh began \\nthe slow descent from the cave.\\nEragon struggled \\nup the sandstone, resting when his side made it impossible to breathe. When he \\nreached the top, he found Saphira already there. They stood together before \\nBrom’s grave and paid their last respects.I can’t believe he’s gone . . . \\nforever. As Eragon turned to depart, Saphira snaked out her long neck to \\ntouch the tomb with the tip of her nose. Her sides vibrated as a low humming \\nfilled the air.\\nThe sandstone \\naround her nose shimmered like gilded dew, turning clear with dancing silver \\nhighlights. Eragon watched in wonder as tendrils of white diamond twisted over \\nthe tomb’s surface in a web of priceless filigree. Sparkling shadows were cast \\non the ground, reflecting splashes of brilliant colors that shifted dazzlingly \\nas the sandstone continued to change. With a satisfied snort, Saphira stepped \\nback and examined her handiwork.\\nThe sculpted \\nsandstone mausoleum of moments before had transformed into a sparkling gemstone \\nvault—under which Brom’s untouched face was visible. Eragon gazed with yearning \\nat the old man, who seemed to be only sleeping. “What did you do?” he asked \\nSaphira with awe.\\nI gave him the \\nonly gift I could. Now time will not ravage him. He can rest in peace for \\neternity.\\n\\nThank you.Eragon put a \\nhand on her side, and they left together.\\nC APTURE \\nATGIL’EAD\\nRiding was \\nextremely painful for Eragon—his broken ribs prevented them from going faster \\nthan a walk, and it was impossible for him to breathe deeply without a burst of \\nagony. Nevertheless, he refused to stop. Saphira flew close by, her mind linked \\nwith his for solace and strength.\\nMurtagh rode \\nconfidently beside Cadoc, flowing smoothly with his horse’s movements. Eragon \\nwatched the gray animal for a while. “You have a beautiful horse. What’s his \\nname?”\\n“Tornac, after \\nthe man who taught me how to fight.” Murtagh patted the horse’s side. “He was \\ngiven to me when he was just a foal. You’d be hard pressed to find a more \\ncourageous and intelligent animal in all of Alagaësia, Saphira excepted, of \\ncourse.”\\n“He is a \\nmagnificent beast,” said Eragon admiringly.\\nMurtagh laughed. \\n“Yes, but Snowfire is as close to his match as I’ve ever seen.”\\nThey covered \\nonly a short distance that day, yet Eragon was glad to be on the move again. It \\nkept his mind off other, more morbid matters. They were riding through \\nunsettled land. The road to Dras-Leona was several leagues to their left. They \\nwould skirt the city by a wide margin on the way to Gil’ead, which was almost \\nas far to the north as Carvahall.\\n\\xa0\\nThey sold Cadoc \\nin a small village. As the horse was led away by his new owner, Eragon \\nregretfully pocketed the few coins he had gained from the transaction. It was \\ndifficult to relinquish Cadoc after crossing half of Alagaësia—and outracing \\nUrgals—on him.\\nThe days rolled \\nby unnoticed as their small group traveled in isolation. Eragon was pleased to \\nfind that he and Murtagh shared many of the same interests; they spent hours \\ndebating the finer points of archery and hunting.\\nThere was one \\nsubject, however, they avoided discussing by unspoken consent: their pasts. \\nEragon did not explain how he had found Saphira, met Brom, or where he came \\nfrom. Murtagh was likewise mute as to why the Empire was chasing him. It was a \\nsimple arrangement, but it worked.\\nYet because of \\ntheir proximity, it was inevitable that they learned about each other. Eragon \\nwas intrigued by Murtagh’s familiarity with the power struggles and politics \\nwithin the Empire. He seemed to know what every noble and courtier was doing \\nand how it affected everyone else. Eragon listened carefully, suspicions \\nwhirling through his mind.\\nThe first week \\nwent by without any sign of the Ra’zac, which allayed some of Eragon’s fears. \\nEven so, they still kept watches at night. Eragon had expected to encounter \\nUrgals on the way to Gil’ead, but they found no trace of them.I thought \\nthese remote places would be teeming with monsters, he mused.Still, I’m \\nnot one to complain if they’ve gone elsewhere.\\nHe dreamed of \\nthe woman no more. And though he tried to scry her, he saw only an empty cell. \\nWhenever they passed a town or city, he checked to see if it had a jail. If it \\ndid, he would disguise himself and visit it, but she was not to be found. His \\ndisguises became increasingly elaborate as he saw notices featuring his name \\nand description—and offering a substantial reward for his capture—posted in \\nvarious towns.\\nTheir travels \\nnorth forced them toward the capital, Urû’baen. It was a heavily populated \\narea, which made it difficult to escape notice. Soldiers patrolled the roads \\nand guarded the bridges. It took them several tense, irritable days to skirt \\nthe capital.\\nOnce they were \\nsafely past Urû’baen, they found themselves on the edge of a vast plain. It was \\nthe same one that Eragon had crossed after leaving Palancar Valley, except now \\nhe was on the opposite side. They kept to the perimeter of the plain and \\ncontinued north, following the Ramr River.\\nEragon’s \\nsixteenth birthday came and went during this time. At Carvahall a celebration \\nwould have been held for his entrance into manhood, but in the wilderness he \\ndid not even mention it to Murtagh.\\nAt nearly six \\nmonths of age, Saphira was much larger. Her wings were massive; every inch of \\nthem was needed to lift her muscular body and thick bones. The fangs that \\njutted from her jaw were nearly as thick around as Eragon’s fist, their points \\nas sharp as Zar’roc.\\n\\xa0\\nThe day finally \\ncame when Eragon unwrapped his side for the last time. His ribs had healed \\ncompletely, leaving him with only a small scar where the Ra’zac’s boot had cut \\nhis side. As Saphira watched, he stretched slowly, then with increasing vigor \\nwhen there was no pain. He flexed his muscles, pleased. In an earlier time he \\nwould have smiled, but after Brom’s death, such expressions did not come \\neasily.\\nHe tugged his \\ntunic on and walked back to the small fire they had made. Murtagh sat next to \\nit, whittling a piece of wood. Eragon drew Zar’roc. Murtagh tensed, though his \\nface remained calm. “Now that I am strong enough, would you like to spar?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nMurtagh tossed \\nthe wood to the side. “With sharpened swords? We could kill each other.”\\n“Here, give me \\nyour sword,” said Eragon. Murtagh hesitated, then handed over his long \\nhand-and-a-half sword. Eragon blocked the edges with magic, the way Brom had \\ntaught him. While Murtagh examined the blade, Eragon said, “I can undo that \\nonce we’re finished.”\\nMurtagh checked \\nthe balance of his sword. Satisfied, he said, “It will do.” Eragon safed \\nZar’roc, settled into a crouch, then swung at Murtagh’s shoulder. Their swords \\nmet in midair. Eragon disengaged with a flourish, thrust, and then riposted as \\nMurtagh parried, dancing away.\\nHe’s fast!thought Eragon.\\nThey struggled \\nback and forth, trying to batter each other down. After a particularly intense \\nseries of blows, Murtagh started laughing. Not only was it impossible for \\neither of them to gain an advantage, but they were so evenly matched that they \\ntired at the same rate. Acknowledging with grins each other’s skill, they \\nfought on until their arms were leaden and sweat poured off their sides.\\nFinally Eragon \\ncalled, “Enough, halt!” Murtagh stopped in mid-blow and sat down with a gasp. \\nEragon staggered to the ground, his chest heaving. None of his fights with Brom \\nhad been this fierce.\\nAs he gulped air, \\nMurtagh exclaimed, “You’re amazing! I’ve studied swordplay all my life, but \\nnever have I fought one like you. You could be the king’s weapon master if you \\nwanted to.”\\n“You’re just as \\ngood,” observed Eragon, still panting. “The man who taught you, Tornac, could \\nmake a fortune with a fencing school. People would come from all parts of \\nAlagaësia to learn from him.”\\n“He’s dead,” \\nsaid Murtagh shortly.\\n“I’m sorry.”\\nThus it became \\ntheir custom to fight in the evening, which kept them lean and fit, like a pair \\nof matched blades. With his return to health, Eragon also resumed practicing \\nmagic. Murtagh was curious about it and soon revealed that he knew a surprising \\namount about how it worked, though he lacked the precise details and could not \\nuse it himself. Whenever Eragon practiced speaking in the ancient language, \\nMurtagh would listen quietly, occasionally asking what a word meant.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the outskirts \\nof Gil’ead they stopped the horses side by side. It had taken them nearly a \\nmonth to reach it, during which time spring had finally nudged away the \\nremnants of winter. Eragon had felt himself changing during the trip, growing \\nstronger and calmer. He still thought about Brom and spoke about him with \\nSaphira, but for the most part he tried not to awaken painful memories.\\nFrom a distance \\nthey could see the city was a rough, barbaric place, filled with log houses and \\nyapping dogs. There was a rambling stone fortress at its center. The air was \\nhazy with blue smoke. The place seemed more like a temporary trading post than \\na permanent city. Five miles beyond it was the hazy outline of Isenstar Lake.\\nThey decided to \\ncamp two miles from the city, for safety. While their dinner simmered, Murtagh \\nsaid, “I’m not sure you should be the one to go into Gil’ead.”\\n“Why? I can \\ndisguise myself well enough,” said Eragon. “And Dormnad will want to see the \\ngedwëy ignasia as proof that I really am a Rider.”\\n“Perhaps,” said \\nMurtagh, “but the Empire wants you much more than me. If I’m captured, I could \\neventually escape. But ifyou are taken, they’ll drag you to the king, \\nwhere you’ll be in for a slow death by torture—unless you join him. Plus, \\nGil’ead is one of the army’s major staging points. Those aren’t houses out \\nthere; they’re barracks. Going in there would be like handing yourself to the \\nking on a gilded platter.”\\nEragon asked \\nSaphira for her opinion. She wrapped her tail around his legs and lay next to \\nhim.You shouldn’t have to ask me; he speaks sense. There are certain words I \\ncan give him that will convince Dormnad of his truthfulness. And Murtagh’s \\nright; if anyone is to risk capture it should be him, because he would live \\nthrough it.\\nHe grimaced.I \\ndon’t like letting him put himself in danger for us. “All right, you can \\ngo,” he said reluctantly. “But if anything goes wrong, I’m coming after you.”\\nMurtagh laughed. \\n“That would be fit for a legend: how a lone Rider took on the king’s army \\nsingle-handedly.” He chuckled again and stood. “Is there anything I should know \\nbefore going?”\\n“Shouldn’t we \\nrest and wait until tomorrow?” asked Eragon cautiously.\\n“Why? The longer \\nwe stay here, the greater the chance that we’ll be discovered. If this Dormnad \\ncan take you to the Varden, then he needs to be found as quickly as possible. \\nNeither of us should remain near Gil’ead longer than a few days.”\\nAgain wisdom \\nflies from his mouth,commented \\nSaphira dryly. She told Eragon what should be said to Dormnad, and he relayed \\nthe information to Murtagh.\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Murtagh, adjusting his sword. “Unless there’s trouble, I’ll be back within \\na couple of hours. Make sure there’s some food left for me.” With a wave of his \\nhand, he jumped onto Tornac and rode away. Eragon sat by the fire, tapping \\nZar’roc’s pommel apprehensively.\\nHours passed, \\nbut Murtagh did not return. Eragon paced around the fire, Zar’roc in hand, \\nwhile Saphira watched Gil’ead attentively. Only her eyes moved. Neither of them \\nvoiced their worries, though Eragon unobtrusively prepared to leave—in case a \\ndetachment of soldiers left the city and headed toward their camp.\\nLook,snapped Saphira.\\nEragon swiveled \\ntoward Gil’ead, alert. He saw a distant horseman exit the city and ride \\nfuriously toward their camp.I don’t like this, he said as he climbed \\nonto Saphira.Be ready to fly.\\nI’m prepared for \\nmore than that.\\n\\nAs the rider \\napproached, Eragon recognized Murtagh bent low over Tornac. No one seemed to be \\npursuing him, but he did not slow his reckless pace. He galloped into the camp \\nand jumped to the ground, drawing his sword. “What’s wrong?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh scowled. \\n“Did anyone follow me from Gil’ead?”\\n“We didn’t see \\nanyone.”\\n“Good. Then let \\nme eat before I explain. I’m starving.” He seized a bowl and began eating with \\ngusto. After a few sloppy bites, he said through a full mouth, “Dormnad has \\nagreed to meet us outside Gil’ead at sunrise tomorrow. If he’s satisfied you \\nreally are a Rider and that it’s not a trap, he’ll take you to the Varden.”\\n“Where are we \\nsupposed to meet him?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh pointed \\nwest. “On a small hill across the road.”\\n“So what happened?”\\nMurtagh spooned \\nmore food into his bowl. “It’s a rather simple thing, but all the more deadly \\nbecause of it: I was seen in the street by someone who knows me. I did the only \\nthing I could and ran away. It was too late, though; he recognized me.”\\nIt was \\nunfortunate, but Eragon was unsure how bad it really was. “Since I don’t know \\nyour friend, I have to ask: Will he tell anyone?”\\nMurtagh gave a \\nstrained laugh. “If youhad met him, that wouldn’t need answering. His \\nmouth is loosely hinged and hangs open all the time, vomiting whatever happens \\nto be in his mind. The question isn’twhether he will tell people, butwhom \\nhe will tell. If word of this reaches the wrong ears, we’ll be in trouble.”\\n“I doubt that \\nsoldiers will be sent to search for you in the dark,” Eragon pointed out. “We \\ncan at least count on being safe until morning, and by then, if all goes well, \\nwe’ll be leaving with Dormnad.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head. “No, only you will accompany him. As I said before, I won’t go to the \\nVarden.”\\nEragon stared at \\nhim unhappily. He wanted Murtagh to stay. They had become friends during their \\ntravels, and he was loath to tear that apart. He started to protest, but \\nSaphira hushed him and said gently,Wait until tomorrow. Now is not the time.\\nVery well,he said glumly. \\nThey talked until the stars were bright in the sky, then slept as Saphira took \\nthe first watch.\\nEragon woke two \\nhours before dawn, his palm tingling. Everything was still and quiet, but \\nsomething sought his attention, like an itch in his mind. He buckled on Zar’roc \\nand stood, careful not to make a sound. Saphira looked at him curiously, her \\nlarge eyes bright.What is it? she asked.\\nI don’t know,said Eragon. He \\nsaw nothing amiss.\\nSaphira sniffed \\nthe air curiously. She hissed a little and lifted her head. I smell horses \\nnearby, but they’re not moving. They reek with an unfamiliar stench.\\nEragon crept to \\nMurtagh and shook his shoulder. Murtagh woke with a start, yanked a dagger from \\nunder his blankets, then looked at Eragon quizzically. Eragon motioned for him \\nto be silent, whispering, “There are horses close by.”\\nMurtagh \\nwordlessly drew his sword. They quietly stationed themselves on either side of \\nSaphira, prepared for an attack. As they waited, the morning star rose in the \\neast. A squirrel chattered.\\nThen an angry \\nsnarl from behind made Eragon spin around, sword held high. A broad Urgal stood \\nat the edge of the camp, carrying a mattock with a nasty spike.Where did he \\ncome from? We haven’t seen their tracks anywhere! thought Eragon. The Urgal \\nroared and waved his weapon, but did not charge.\\n“Brisingr!” \\nbarked Eragon, stabbing out with magic. The Urgal’s face contorted with terror \\nas he exploded in a flash of blue light. Blood splattered Eragon, and a brown \\nmass flew through the air. Behind him, Saphira bugled with alarm and reared. \\nEragon twisted around. While he had been occupied with the first Urgal, a group \\nof them had run up from the side.Of all the stupid tricks to fall for!\\nSteel clashed \\nloudly as Murtagh attacked the Urgals. Eragon tried to join him but was blocked \\nby four of the monsters. The first one swung a sword at his shoulder. He ducked \\nthe blow and killed the Urgal with magic. He caught a second one in the throat \\nwith Zar’roc, wheeled wildly, and slashed a third through the heart. As he did, \\nthe fourth Urgal rushed at him, swinging a heavy club.\\nEragon saw him \\ncoming and tried to lift his sword to block the club, but was a second too \\nslow. As the club came down on his head, he screamed, “Fly, Saphira!” A burst \\nof light filled his eyes and he lost consciousness.\\nD USÚNDAVARFREOHR\\nThe first things \\nEragon noticed were that he was warm and dry, his cheek was pressed against \\nrough fabric, and his hands were unbound. He stirred, but it was minutes before \\nhe was able to push himself upright and examine his surroundings.\\nHe was sitting \\nin a cell on a narrow, bumpy cot. A barred window was set high in the wall. The \\niron-bound door with a small window in its top half, barred like the one in the \\nwall, was shut securely.\\nDried blood \\ncracked on Eragon’s face when he moved. It took him a moment to remember that \\nit was not his. His head hurt horribly—which was to be expected, considering \\nthe blow he had taken—and his mind was strangely fuzzy. He tried to use magic, \\nbut could not concentrate well enough to remember any of the ancient words.They \\nmust have drugged me, he finally decided.\\nWith a groan he \\ngot up, missing the familiar weight of Zar’roc on his hip, and lurched to the \\nwindow in the wall. He managed to see out of it by standing on his toes. It \\ntook a minute for his eyes to adjust to the bright light outside. The window \\nwas level with the ground. A street full of busy people ran past the side of \\nhis cell, beyond which were rows of identical log houses.\\nFeeling weak, \\nEragon slid to the floor and stared at it blankly. What he had seen outside \\ndisturbed him, but he was unsure why. Cursing his sluggish thinking, he leaned \\nback his head and tried to clear his mind. A man entered the room and set a \\ntray of food and a pitcher of water on the cot.Wasn’t that nice of him? \\nthought Eragon, smiling pleasantly. He took a couple of bites of the thin \\ncabbage soup and stale bread, but was barely able to stomach it.I wish he \\nhad brought me something better, he complained, dropping the spoon.\\nHe suddenly \\nrealized what was wrong.I was captured by Urgals, not men! How did I end up \\nhere? His befuddled brain grappled with the paradox unsuccessfully. With a \\nmental shrug he filed the discovery away for a time when he would know what to \\ndo with it.\\nHe sat on the \\ncot and gazed into the distance. Hours later more food was brought in.And I \\nwas just getting hungry, he thought thickly. This time he was able to eat \\nwithout feeling sick. When he finished, he decided it was time for a nap. After \\nall, he was on a bed; what else was he going to do?\\nHis mind drifted \\noff; sleep began to envelop him. Then a gate clanged open somewhere, and the \\ndin of steel-shod boots marching on a stone floor filled the air. The noise \\ngrew louder and louder until it sounded like someone banging a pot inside \\nEragon’s head. He grumbled to himself.Can’t they let me rest in peace? \\nFuzzy curiosity slowly overcame his exhaustion, so he dragged himself to the \\ndoor, blinking like an owl.\\nThrough the \\nwindow he saw a wide hallway nearly ten yards across. The opposing wall was \\nlined with cells similar to his own. A column of soldiers marched through the \\nhall, their swords drawn and ready. Every man was dressed in matching armor; \\ntheir faces bore the same hard expression, and their feet came down on the \\nfloor with mechanical precision, never missing a beat. The sound was hypnotic. \\nIt was an impressive display of force.\\nEragon watched \\nthe soldiers until he grew bored. Just then he noticed a break in the middle of \\nthe column. Carried between two burly men was an unconscious woman.\\nHer long \\nmidnight-black hair obscured her face, despite a leather strip bound around her \\nhead to hold the tresses back. She was dressed in dark leather pants and shirt. \\nWrapped around her slim waist was a shiny belt, from which hung an empty sheath \\non her right hip. Knee-high boots covered her calves and small feet.\\nHer head lolled \\nto the side. Eragon gasped, feeling like he had been struck in the stomach. She \\nwas the woman from his dreams. Her sculpted face was as perfect as a painting. \\nHer round chin, high cheekbones, and long eyelashes gave her an exotic look. \\nThe only mar in her beauty was a scrape along her jaw; nevertheless, she was \\nthe fairest woman he had ever seen.\\nEragon’s blood \\nburned as he looked at her. Something awoke in him—something he had never felt \\nbefore. It was like an obsession, except stronger, almost a fevered madness. \\nThen the woman’s hair shifted, revealing pointed ears. A chill crept over him. \\nShe was an elf.\\nThe soldiers \\ncontinued marching, taking her from his sight. Next strode a tall, proud man, a \\nsable cape billowing behind him. His face was deathly white; his hair was red. \\nRed like blood.\\nAs he walked by \\nEragon’s cell, the man turned his head and looked squarely at him with maroon \\neyes. His upper lip pulled back in a feral smile, revealing teeth filed to \\npoints. Eragon shrank back. He knew what the man was.A Shade.So help me . . \\n. a Shade. The procession continued, and the Shade vanished from view.\\nEragon sank to \\nthe floor, hugging himself. Even in his bewildered state, he knew that the \\npresence of a Shade meant that evil was loose in the land. Whenever they \\nappeared, rivers of blood were sure to follow.What is a Shade doing here? \\nThe soldiers should have killed him on sight! Then his thoughts returned to \\nthe elf-woman, and he was grasped by strange emotions again.\\nI have to \\nescape.But \\nwith his mind clouded, his determination quickly faded. He returned to the cot. \\nBy the time the hallway fell silent, he was fast asleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAs soon as \\nEragon opened his eyes, he knew something was different. It was easier for him \\nto think; he realized that he was in Gil’ead.They made a mistake; the drug’s \\nwearing off! Hopeful, he tried to contact Saphira and use magic, but both \\nactivities were still beyond his reach. A pit of worry twisted inside him as he \\nwondered if she and Murtagh had managed to escape. He stretched his arms and \\nlooked out the window. The city was just awakening; the street was empty except \\nfor two beggars.\\nHe reached for \\nthe water pitcher, ruminating about the elf and Shade. As he started to drink, \\nhe noticed that the water had a faint odor, as if it contained a few drops of \\nrancid perfume. Grimacing, he set the pitcher down.The drug must be in there \\nand maybe in the food as well! He remembered that when the Ra’zac had \\ndrugged him, it had taken hours to wear off.If I can keep from drinking and \\neating for long enough, I should be able to use magic. Then I can rescue the \\nelf. . . . The thought made him smile. He sat in a corner, dreaming about \\nhow it could be done.\\nThe portly \\njailer entered the cell an hour later with a tray of food. Eragon waited until \\nhe departed, then carried the tray to the window. The meal was composed only of \\nbread, cheese, and an onion, but the smell made his stomach grumble hungrily. Resigning \\nhimself to a miserable day, he shoved the food out the window and onto the \\nstreet, hoping that no one would notice.\\nEragon devoted \\nhimself to overcoming the drug’s effects. He had difficulty concentrating for \\nany length of time, but as the day progressed, his mental acuity increased. He \\nbegan to remember several of the ancient words, though nothing happened when he \\nuttered them. He wanted to scream with frustration.\\nWhen lunch was \\ndelivered, he pushed it out the window after his breakfast. His hunger was \\ndistracting, but it was the lack of water that taxed him most. The back of his \\nthroat was parched. Thoughts of drinking cool water tortured him as each breath \\ndried his mouth and throat a bit more. Even so, he forced himself to ignore the \\npitcher.\\nHe was diverted \\nfrom his discomfort by a commotion in the hall. A man argued in a loud voice, \\n“You can’t go in there! The orders were clear: no one is to see him!”\\n“Really? Will \\nyou be the one to die stopping me, Captain?” cut in a smooth voice.\\nThere was a \\nsubdued, “No . . . but the king—”\\n“Iwill \\nhandle the king,” interrupted the second person. “Now, unlock the door.”\\nAfter a pause, \\nkeys jangled outside Eragon’s cell. He tried to adopt a languorous expression.I \\nhave to act like I don’t understand what’s going on. I can’t show surprise, no \\nmatter what this person says.\\nThe door opened. \\nHis breath caught as he looked into the Shade’s face. It was like gazing at a \\ndeath mask or a polished skull with skin pulled over it to give the appearance \\nof life. “Greetings,” said the Shade with a cold smile, showing his filed \\nteeth. “I’ve waited a long time to meet you.”\\n“Who—who’re \\nyou?” asked Eragon, slurring his words.\\n“No one of \\nconsequence,” answered the Shade, his maroon eyes alight with controlled \\nmenace. He sat with a flourish of his cloak. “My name does not matter to one in \\nyour position. It wouldn’t mean a thing to you anyway. It’s you that I’m \\ninterested in. Who are you?”\\nThe question was \\nposed innocently enough, but Eragon knew there had to be a catch or trap in it, \\nthough it eluded him. He pretended to struggle over the question for a while, \\nthen slowly said, frowning, “I’m not sure. . . . M’name’s Eragon, but that’s \\nnot all I am, is it?”\\nThe Shade’s \\nnarrow lips stretched tautly over his mouth as he laughed sharply. “No, it \\nisn’t. You have an interesting mind, my young Rider.” He leaned forward. The \\nskin on his forehead was thin and translucent. “It seems I must be more direct. \\nWhat is your name?”\\n“Era—”\\n“No! Not that \\none.” The Shade cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Don’t you have another \\none, one that you use only rarely?”\\nHe wants my true \\nname so he can control me!realized Eragon.But I can’t tell him. I don’t \\neven know it myself. He thought quickly, trying to invent a deception that \\nwould conceal his ignorance.What if I made up a name? He hesitated—it \\ncould easily give him away—then raced to create a name that would withstand \\nscrutiny. As he was about to utter it, he decided to take a chance and try to scare \\nthe Shade. He deftly switched a few letters, then nodded foolishly and said, \\n“Brom told it to me once. It was . . .” The pause stretched for a few seconds, \\nthen his face brightened as he appeared to remember. “It was Du Súndavar \\nFreohr.” Which meant almost literally “death of the shadows.”\\nA grim chill \\nsettled over the cell as the Shade sat motionless, eyes veiled. He seemed to be \\ndeep in thought, pondering what he had learned. Eragon wondered if he had dared \\ntoo much. He waited until the Shade stirred before asking ingenuously, “Why are \\nyou here?”\\nThe Shade looked \\nat him with contempt in his red eyes and smiled. “To gloat, of course. What use \\nis a victory if one cannot enjoy it?” There was confidence in his voice, but he \\nseemed uneasy, as if his plans had been disrupted. He stood suddenly. “I must \\nattend to certain matters, but while I am gone you would do well to think on \\nwho you would rather serve: a Rider who betrayed your own order or a fellow man \\nlike me, though one skilled in arcane arts. When the time comes to choose, \\nthere will be no middle ground.” He turned to leave, then glanced at Eragon’s \\nwater pitcher and stopped, his face granite hard. “Captain!” he snapped.\\nA \\nbroad-shouldered man rushed into the cell, sword in hand. “What is it, my \\nlord?” he asked, alarmed.\\n“Put that toy \\naway,” instructed the Shade. He turned to Eragon and said in a deadly quiet \\nvoice, “The boy hasn’t been drinking his water. Why is that?”\\n“I talked with \\nthe jailer earlier. Every bowl and plate was scraped clean.”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid the Shade, mollified. “But make sure that he starts drinking again.” He \\nleaned toward the captain and murmured into his ear. Eragon caught the last few \\nwords, “. . . extra dose, just in case.” The captain nodded. The Shade returned \\nhis attention to Eragon. “We will talk again tomorrow when I am not so pressed \\nfor time. You should know, I have an endless fascination for names. I will \\ngreatly enjoy discussing yours inmuch greater detail.”\\nThe way he said \\nit gave Eragon a sinking feeling.\\nOnce they left, \\nhe lay on the cot and closed his eyes. Brom’s lessons proved their worth now; \\nhe relied on them to keep himself from panicking and to reassure himself.Everything \\nhas been provided for me; I only have to take advantage of it. His thoughts \\nwere interrupted by the sound of approaching soldiers.\\nApprehensive, he \\nwent to the door and saw two soldiers dragging the elf down the hallway. When \\nhe could see her no more, Eragon slumped to the floor and tried to touch the \\nmagic again. Oaths flew from his lips when it eluded his grasp.\\nHe looked out at \\nthe city and ground his teeth. It was only midafternoon. Taking a calming \\nbreath, he tried to wait patiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nF IGHTINGSHADOWS\\nIt was dark in \\nEragon’s cell when he sat up with a start, electrified. The wrinkle had shifted! \\nHe had felt the magic at the edge of his consciousness for hours, but every \\ntime he tried to use it, nothing happened. Eyes bright with nervous energy, he \\nclenched his hands and said, “Nagz reisa!” With a flap, the cot’s blanket flew \\ninto the air and crumpled into a ball the size of his fist. It landed on the \\nfloor with a soft thump.\\nExhilarated, \\nEragon stood. He was weak from his enforced fast, but his excitement overcame \\nhis hunger.Now for the real test. He reached out with his mind and felt \\nthe lock on the door. Instead of trying to break or cut it, he simply pushed \\nits internal mechanism into the unlocked position. With a click, the door \\ncreaked inward.\\nWhen he had \\nfirst used magic to kill the Urgals in Yazuac, it had consumed nearly all of \\nhis strength, but he had grown much stronger since then. What once would have \\nexhausted him now only tired him slightly.\\nHe cautiously \\nstepped into the hall.I have to find Zar’roc and the elf. She must be in one \\nof these cells, but there isn’t time to look in them all. As for Zar’roc, the \\nShade might have it with him. He realized that his thinking was still \\nmuddled.Why am I out here? I could escape right now if I went back into the \\ncell and opened the window with magic. But then I wouldn’t be able to rescue \\nthe elf. . . . Saphira, where are you? I need your help. He silently \\nberated himself for not contacting her sooner. That should have been the first \\nthing he did after getting his power back.\\nHer reply came \\nwith surprising alacrity.Eragon! I’m over Gil’ead. Don’t do anything. \\nMurtagh is on the way.\\nWhat are—Footsteps \\ninterrupted him. He spun around, crouching as a squad of six soldiers marched \\ninto the hall. They halted abruptly, eyes flicking between Eragon and the open \\ncell door. Blood drained from their faces.Good, they know who I am.Maybe I \\ncan scare them off so we won’t have to fight.\\n“Charge!” yelled \\none of the soldiers, running forward. The rest of the men drew their blades and \\npounded down the hall.\\nIt was madness \\nto fight six men when he was unarmed and weak, but the thought of the elf kept \\nhim in place. He could not force himself to abandon her. Uncertain if the \\neffort would leave him standing, he pulled on his power and raised his hand, \\nthe gedwëy ignasia glowing. Fear showed in the soldiers’ eyes, but they were \\nhardened warriors and did not slow. As Eragon opened his mouth to pronounce the \\nfatal words, there was a low buzz, a flicker of motion. One of the men crashed \\nto the floor with an arrow in his back. Two more were struck before anyone \\nunderstood what was happening.\\nAt the end of \\nthe hall, where the soldiers had entered, stood a ragged, bearded man with a \\nbow. A crutch lay on the floor by his feet, apparently unneeded, for he stood \\ntall and straight.\\nThe three remaining \\nsoldiers turned to face this new threat. Eragon took advantage of the \\nconfusion. “Thrysta!” he shouted. One of the men clutched his chest and fell. \\nEragon staggered as the magic took its toll. Another soldier fell, pierced \\nthrough the neck with an arrow. “Don’t kill him!” called Eragon, seeing his \\nrescuer take aim at the last soldier. The bearded man lowered his bow.\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on the soldier before him. The man was breathing hard; the whites \\nof his eyes showed. He seemed to understand that his life was being spared.\\n“You’ve seen \\nwhat I can do,” said Eragon harshly. “If you don’t answer my questions, the \\nrest of your life will be spent in utter misery and torment. Now where’s my \\nsword—its sheath and blade are red—and what cell is the elf in?”\\nThe man clamped \\nhis mouth shut.\\nEragon’s palm \\nglowed ominously as he reached for the magic. “That was the wrong answer,” he \\nsnapped. “Do you know how much pain a grain of sand can cause you when it’s \\nembedded red hot in your stomach? Especially when it doesn’t cool off for the \\nnext twenty years and slowly burns its way down to your toes! By the time it \\ngets out of you, you’ll be an old man.” He paused for effect. “Unless you tell \\nme what I want.”\\nThe soldier’s \\neyes bulged, but he remained silent. Eragon scraped some dirt off the stone \\nfloor and observed dispassionately, “This is a bit more than a piece of sand, \\nbut be comforted; it’ll burn through you faster. Still, it’ll leave a bigger \\nhole.” At his word, the dirt shone cherry red, though it did not burn his hand.\\n“All right, just \\ndon’t put that in me!” yelped the soldier. “The elf’s in the last cell to the \\nleft! I don’t know about your sword, but it’s probably in the guardroom \\nupstairs. All the weapons are there.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nthen murmured, “Slytha.” The soldier’s eyes rolled up in his head, and he \\ncollapsed limply.\\n“Did you kill \\nhim?”\\nEragon looked at \\nthe stranger, who was now only a few paces away. He narrowed his eyes, trying \\nto see past the beard. “Murtagh! Is that you?” he exclaimed.\\n“Yes,” said \\nMurtagh, briefly lifting the beard from his shaven face. “I don’t want my face \\nseen. Did you kill him?”\\n“No, he’s only \\nasleep. How did you get in?”\\n“There’s no time \\nto explain. We have to get up to the next floor before anyone finds us. \\nThere’ll be an escape route for us in a few minutes. We don’t want to miss it.”\\n“Didn’t you hear \\nwhat I said?” asked Eragon, gesturing at the unconscious soldier. “There’s an \\nelf in the prison. I saw her! We have to rescue her. I need your help.”\\n“An elf . . . !” \\nMurtagh hurried down the hall, growling, “This is a mistake. We should flee \\nwhile we have the chance.” He stopped before the cell the soldier had indicated \\nand produced a ring of keys from under his ragged cloak. “I took it from one of \\nthe guards,” he explained.\\nEragon motioned \\nfor the keys. Murtagh shrugged and handed them to him. Eragon found the right \\none and swung the door open. A single beam of moonlight slanted through the \\nwindow, illuminating the elf’s face with cool silver.\\nShe faced him, \\ntense and coiled, ready for whatever would happen next. She held her head high, \\nwith a queen’s demeanor. Her eyes, dark green, almost black, and slightly \\nangled like a cat’s, lifted to Eragon’s. Chills shot through him.\\nTheir gaze held \\nfor a moment, then the elf trembled and collapsed soundlessly. Eragon barely \\ncaught her before she struck the floor. She was surprisingly light. The aroma \\nof freshly crushed pine needles surrounded her.\\nMurtagh entered \\nthe cell. “She’s beautiful!”\\n“But hurt.”\\n“We can tend to \\nher later. Are you strong enough to carry her?” Eragon shook his head. “Then \\nI’ll do it,” said Murtagh as he slung the elf across his shoulders. “Now, \\nupstairs!” He handed Eragon a dagger, then hurried back into the hall littered \\nwith soldiers’ bodies.\\nWith heavy \\nfootsteps Murtagh led Eragon to a stone-hewn staircase at the end of the hall. \\nAs they climbed it, Eragon asked, “How are we going to get out without being \\nnoticed?”\\n“We’re not,” \\ngrunted Murtagh.\\nThat did not \\nallay Eragon’s fears. He listened anxiously for soldiers or anyone else who \\nmight be nearby, dreading what might happen if they met the Shade. At the head \\nof the stairs was a banquet room filled with broad wooden tables. Shields lined \\nthe walls, and the wood ceiling was trussed with curved beams. Murtagh laid the \\nelf on a table and looked at the ceiling worriedly. “Can you talk to Saphira \\nfor me?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Tell her to \\nwait another five minutes.”\\nThere were \\nshouts in the distance. Soldiers marched past the entrance to the banquet room. \\nEragon’s mouth tightened with pent-up tension. “Whatever you’re planning to do, \\nI don’t think we have much time.”\\n“Just tell her, \\nand stay out of sight,” snapped Murtagh, running off.\\nAs Eragon \\nrelayed the message, he was alarmed to hear men coming up the stairs. Fighting \\nhunger and exhaustion, he dragged the elf off the table and hid her underneath \\nit. He crouched next to her, holding his breath, tightly clenching the dagger.\\nTen soldiers \\nentered the room. They swept through it hurriedly, looking under only a couple \\nof tables, and continued on their way. Eragon leaned against a table leg, \\nsighing. The respite made him suddenly aware of his burning stomach and parched \\nthroat. A tankard and a plate of half-eaten food on the other side of the room \\ncaught his attention.\\nEragon dashed \\nfrom his hiding place, grabbed the food, then scurried back to the table. There \\nwas amber beer in the tankard, which he drank in two great gulps. Relief seeped \\nthrough him as the cool liquid ran down his throat, soothing the irritated \\ntissue. He suppressed a belch before ravenously tearing into a hunk of bread.\\nMurtagh returned \\ncarrying Zar’roc, a strange bow, and an elegant sword without a sheath. Murtagh \\ngave Zar’roc to Eragon. “I found the other sword and bow in the guardroom. I’ve \\nnever seen weapons like them before, so I assumed they were the elf’s.”\\n“Let’s find \\nout,” said Eragon through a mouthful of bread. The sword—slim and light with a \\ncurved crossguard, the ends of which narrowed into sharp points—fit the elf’s \\nsheath perfectly. There was no way to tell if the bow was hers, but it was \\nshaped so gracefully he doubted it could be anyone else’s. “What now?” he \\nasked, cramming another bite of food into his mouth. “We can’t stay here \\nforever. Sooner or later the soldiers will find us.”\\n“Now,” said \\nMurtagh, taking out his own bow and fitting an arrow to the string, “we wait. \\nLike I said, our escape has been arranged.”\\n“You don’t \\nunderstand; there’s a Shade here! If he finds us, we’re doomed.”\\n“A Shade!” \\nexclaimed Murtagh. “In that case, tell Saphira to come immediately. We were \\ngoing to wait until the watch changed, but delaying even that long is too \\ndangerous now.” Eragon relayed the message succinctly, refraining from \\ndistracting Saphira with questions. “You messed up my plans by escaping \\nyourself,” groused Murtagh, watching the room’s entrances for soldiers.\\nEragon smiled. \\n“In that case, perhaps I should have waited.Your timing was perfect, \\nthough. I wouldn’t have been able to even crawl if I had been forced to fight \\nall those soldiers with magic.”\\n“Glad to be of \\nsome use,” remarked Murtagh. He stiffened as they heard men running nearby. \\n“Let’s just hope the Shade doesn’t find us.”\\nA cold chuckle \\nfilled the banquet room. “I’m afraid it’s far too late for that.”\\nMurtagh and \\nEragon spun around. The Shade stood alone at the end of the room. In his hand \\nwas a pale sword with a thin scratch on the blade. He unclasped the brooch that \\nheld his cape in place and let the garment fall to the floor. His body was like \\na runner’s, thin and compact, but Eragon remembered Brom’s warning and knew \\nthat the Shade’s appearance was deceiving; he was many times stronger than a \\nnormal human.\\n“So, my youngRider, \\ndo you wish to test yourself against me?” sneered the Shade. “I shouldn’t have \\ntrusted the captain when he said you ate all your food. I will not make that \\nmistake again.”\\n“I’ll take care \\nof him,” said Murtagh quietly, putting down his bow and drawing his sword.\\n“No,” said \\nEragon under his breath. “He wants me alive, not you. I can stall him for a \\nshort while, but then you’d better have a way out for us.”\\n“Fine, go,” said \\nMurtagh. “You won’t have to hold him off for long.”\\n“I hope not,” \\nsaid Eragon grimly. He drew Zar’roc and slowly advanced. The red blade glinted \\nwith light from torches on the wall.\\nThe Shade’s \\nmaroon eyes burned like coals. He laughed softly. “Do you really think to \\ndefeat me, Du Súndavar Freohr? What a pitiful name. I would have expected \\nsomething more subtle from you, but I suppose that’s all you’re capable of.”\\nEragon refused \\nto let himself be goaded. He stared at the Shade’s face, waiting for a flicker \\nof his eyes or twitch of his lip, anything that would betray his next move.I \\ncan’t use magic for fear of provoking him to do the same. He has to think that \\nhe can win without resorting to it—which he probably can.\\nBefore either of \\nthem moved, the ceiling boomed and shook. Dust billowed from it and turned the \\nair gray while pieces of wood fell around them, shattering on the floor. From \\nthe roof came screams and the sound of clashing metal. Afraid of being brained \\nby the falling timber, Eragon flicked his eyes upward. The Shade took advantage \\nof his distraction and attacked.\\nEragon barely \\nmanaged to get Zar’roc up in time to block a slash at his ribs. Their blades \\nmet with a clang that jarred his teeth and numbed his arm.Hellfire! He’s \\nstrong! He grasped Zar’roc with both hands and swung with all of his might \\nat the Shade’s head. The Shade blocked him with ease, whipping his sword \\nthrough the air faster than Eragon had thought possible.\\nTerrible \\nscreeches sounded above them, like iron spikes being drawn across rock. Three \\nlong cracks split the ceiling. Shingles from the slate roof fell through the \\nfissures. Eragon ignored them, even when one smashed into the floor next to \\nhim. Though he had trained with a master of the blade, Brom, and with Murtagh, \\nwho was also a deadly swordsman, he had never been this outclassed. The Shade \\nwasplaying with him.\\nEragon retreated \\ntoward Murtagh, arms trembling as he parried the Shade’s blows. Each one seemed \\nmore powerful than the last. Eragon was no longer strong enough to call upon \\nmagic for help even if he had wanted to. Then, with a contemptuous flick of his \\nwrist, the Shade knocked Zar’roc out of Eragon’s hand. The force of the blow \\nsent him to his knees, where he stayed, panting. The screeching was louder than \\never. Whatever was happening, it was getting closer.\\nThe Shade stared \\ndown at him haughtily. “A powerful piece you may be in the game that is being \\nplayed, but I’m disappointed that this is your best. If the other Riders were this \\nweak, they must have controlled the Empire only through sheer numbers.”\\nEragon looked up \\nand shook his head. He had figured out Murtagh’s plan.Saphira, now would be \\na good time. “No, you forget something.”\\n“And what might \\nthat be?” asked the Shade mockingly.\\nThere was a \\nthunderous reverberation as a chunk of the ceiling was torn away to reveal the \\nnight sky. “The dragons!” roared Eragon over the noise, and threw himself out \\nof the Shade’s reach. The Shade snarled in rage, swinging his sword viciously. \\nHe missed and lunged. Surprise spread across his face as one of Murtagh’s \\narrows sprouted from his shoulder.\\nThe Shade \\nlaughed and snapped the arrow off with two fingers. “You’ll have to do better \\nthan that if you want to stop me.” The next arrow caught him between the eyes. \\nThe Shade howled with agony and writhed, covering his face. His skin turned \\ngray. Mist formed in the air around him, obscuring his figure. There was a \\nshattering cry; then the cloud vanished.\\nWhere the Shade \\nhad been, nothing was left but his cape and a pile of clothes. “You killed \\nhim!” exclaimed Eragon. He knew of only two heroes of legend who had survived \\nslaying a Shade.\\n“I’m not so \\nsure,” said Murtagh.\\nA man shouted, \\n“That’s it. He failed. Go in and get them!” Soldiers with nets and spears \\npoured into the banquet room from both ends. Eragon and Murtagh backed up \\nagainst the wall, dragging the elf with them. The men formed a menacing \\nhalf-circle around them. Then Saphira stuck her head through the hole in the \\nceiling and roared. She gripped the edge of the opening with her powerful \\ntalons and ripped off another large section of the ceiling.\\nThree soldiers \\nturned and ran, but the rest held their positions. With a resounding report, \\nthe center beam of the ceiling cracked and rained down heavy shingles. \\nConfusion scattered the ranks as they tried to dodge the deadly barrage. Eragon \\nand Murtagh pressed against the wall to avoid the falling debris. Saphira \\nroared again, and the soldiers fled, some getting crushed on the way.\\nWith a final \\ntitanic effort, Saphira tore off the rest of the ceiling before jumping into \\nthe banquet hall with her wings folded. Her weight splintered a table with a \\nsharp crunch. Crying out with relief, Eragon threw his arms around her. She \\nhummed contentedly.I’ve missed you, little one.\\nSame here. \\nThere’s someone else with us. Can you carry three? \\nOf course,she said, \\nkicking shingles and tables out of the way so she could take off. Murtagh and \\nEragon pulled the elf out of hiding. Saphira hissed in surprise as she saw her.An \\nelf!\\nYes, and the \\nwoman I saw in my dreams,said Eragon, picking up Zar’roc. He helped Murtagh \\nsecure the elf into the saddle, then they both climbed onto Saphira.I heard \\nfighting on the roof. Are there men up there?\\nThere were, but \\nno more. Are you ready? \\nYes. \\nSaphira leapt \\nout of the banquet hall and onto the fortress’s roof, where the bodies of \\nwatchmen lay scattered. “Look!” said Murtagh, pointing. A row of archers filed \\nout of a tower on the other side of the roofless hall.\\n“Saphira, you \\nhave to take off. Now!” warned Eragon.\\nShe unfurled her \\nwings, ran toward the edge of the building, and propelled them over it with her \\npowerful legs. The extra weight on her back made her drop alarmingly. As she \\nstruggled to gain altitude, Eragon heard the musical twang of bowstrings being \\nreleased.\\nArrows whizzed \\ntoward them in the dark. Saphira roared with pain as she was struck and quickly \\nrolled to the left to avoid the next volley. More arrows perforated the sky, but \\nthe night protected them from the shafts’ deadly bite. Distressed, Eragon bent \\nover Saphira’s neck.Where are you hurt?\\nMy wings are \\npierced . . . one of the arrows didn’t go all the way through. It’s still \\nthere.Her \\nbreathing was labored and heavy.\\nHow far can you \\ntake us?\\n\\nFar enough.Eragon clutched \\nthe elf tightly as they skimmed over Gil’ead, then left the city behind and \\nveered eastward, soaring upward through the night.\\nAW ARRIOR AND \\nAHEALER\\nSaphira drifted \\ndown to a clearing, landed on the crest of a hill, and rested her outstretched \\nwings on the ground. Eragon could feel her shaking beneath him. They were only \\na half-league from Gil’ead.\\nPicketed in the \\nclearing were Snowfire and Tornac, who snorted nervously at Saphira’s arrival. \\nEragon slid to the ground and immediately turned to Saphira’s injuries, while \\nMurtagh readied the horses.\\nUnable to see \\nwell in the darkness, Eragon ran his hands blindly over Saphira’s wings. He \\nfound three places where arrows had punctured the thin membrane, leaving bloody \\nholes as thick around as his thumb. A small piece had also been torn out of the \\nback edge of her left wing. She shivered when his fingers brushed the injuries. \\nHe tiredly healed the wounds with words from the ancient language. Then he went \\nto the arrow that was embedded in one of the large muscles of her flying arm. \\nThe arrowhead poked through its underside. Warm blood dripped off it.\\nEragon called \\nMurtagh over and instructed, “Hold her wing down. I have to remove this arrow.” \\nHe indicated where Murtagh should grip.This will be painful, he warned \\nSaphira,but it’ll be over quickly. Try not to struggle—you’ll hurt us.\\nShe extended her \\nneck and grabbed a tall sapling between her curved teeth. With a yank of her \\nhead, she pulled the tree out of the ground and clamped it firmly in her jaws.I’m \\nready.\\nOkay,said Eragon. \\n“Hold on,” he whispered to Murtagh, then broke off the head of the arrow. \\nTrying not cause any more damage, he swiftly pulled the shaft out of Saphira. \\nAs it left her muscle, she threw back her head and whimpered past the tree in \\nher mouth. Her wing jerked involuntarily, clipping Murtagh under the chin and \\nknocking him to the ground.\\nWith a growl, \\nSaphira shook the tree, spraying them with dirt before tossing it away. After \\nEragon sealed the wound, he helped Murtagh up. “She caught me by surprise,” \\nadmitted Murtagh, touching his scraped jaw.\\nI’m sorry. \\n“She didn’t mean \\nto hit you,” assured Eragon. He checked on the unconscious elf.You’re going \\nto have to carry her a bit longer, he told Saphira.We can’t take her on \\nthe horses and ride fast enough. Flying should be easier for you now that the \\narrow is out.\\nSaphira dipped \\nher head.I will do it.\\nThank you,said Eragon. He \\nhugged her fiercely.What you did was incredible; I’ll never forget it.\\nHer eyes \\nsoftened.I will go now. He backed away as she flew up in a flurry of \\nair, the elf’s hair streaming back. Seconds later they were gone. Eragon \\nhurried to Snowfire, pulled himself into the saddle, and galloped away with \\nMurtagh.\\nWhile they rode, \\nEragon tried to remember what he knew about elves. They had long lives—that \\nfact was oft repeated—although he knew not how long. They spoke the ancient \\nlanguage, and many could use magic. After the Riders’ fall, elves had retreated \\ninto seclusion. None of them had been seen in the Empire since.So why is one \\nhere now? And how did the Empire manage to capture her? If she can use magic, \\nshe’s probably drugged as I was.\\nThey traveled \\nthrough the night, not stopping even when their flagging strength began to slow \\nthem. They continued onward despite burning eyes and clumsy movements. Behind \\nthem, lines of torch-bearing horsemen searched around Gil’ead for their trail.\\nAfter many \\nbleary hours, dawn lightened the sky. By unspoken consent Eragon and Murtagh \\nstopped the horses. “We have to make camp,” said Eragon wearily. “I must \\nsleep—whether they catch us or not.”\\n“Agreed,” said \\nMurtagh, rubbing his eyes. “Have Saphira land. We’ll meet her.”\\nThey followed \\nSaphira’s directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a \\nsmall cliff, the elf still slouched on her back. Saphira greeted them with a \\nsoft bugle as Eragon dismounted.\\nMurtagh helped \\nhim remove the elf from Saphira’s saddle and lower her to the ground. Then they \\nsagged against the rock face, exhausted. Saphira examined the elf curiously.I \\nwonder why she hasn’t woken. It’s been hours since we left Gil’ead.\\nWho knows what \\nthey did to her?said \\nEragon grimly.\\nMurtagh followed \\ntheir gaze. “As far as I know, she’s the first elf the king has captured. Ever \\nsince they went into hiding, he’s been looking for them without success—until \\nnow. So he’s either found their sanctuary, or she was captured by chance. I \\nthink it was chance. If he had found the elf haven, he would have declared war \\nand sent his army after the elves. Since that hasn’t happened, the question is, \\nWere Galbatorix’s men able to extract the elves’ location before we rescued \\nher?”\\n“We won’t know \\nuntil she regains consciousness. Tell me what happened after I was captured. \\nHow did I end up in Gil’ead?”\\n“The Urgals are \\nworking for the Empire,” said Murtagh shortly, pushing back his hair. “And, it \\nseems, the Shade as well. Saphira and I saw the Urgals give you to him—though I \\ndidn’t know who it was at the time—and a group of soldiers. They were the ones \\nwho took you to Gil’ead.”\\nIt’s true,said Saphira, \\ncurling up next to them.\\nEragon’s mind \\nflashed back to the Urgals he had spoken with at Teirm and the “master” they \\nhad mentioned.They meant the king! I insulted the most powerful man in \\nAlagaësia! he realized with dread. Then he remembered the horror of the \\nslaughtered villagers in Yazuac. A sick, angry feeling welled in his stomach.The \\nUrgals were under Galbatorix’s orders! Why would he commit such an atrocity on \\nhis own subjects?\\nBecause he is \\nevil,stated \\nSaphira flatly.\\nGlowering, \\nEragon exclaimed, “This will mean war! Once the people of the Empire learn of \\nit, they will rebel and support the Varden.”\\nMurtagh rested \\nhis chin in his hand. “Even if they heard of this outrage, few would make it to \\nthe Varden. With the Urgals under his command, the king has enough warriors to \\nclose the Empire’s borders and remain in control, no matter how disruptive \\npeople are. With such a rule of terror, he will be able to shape the Empire \\nhowever he wants. And though he is hated, people could be galvanized into \\njoining him if they had a common enemy.”\\n“Who would that \\nbe?” asked Eragon, confused.\\n“The elves and \\nthe Varden. With the right rumors they can be portrayed as the most despicable \\nmonsters in Alagaësia—fiends who are waiting to seize your land and wealth. The \\nEmpire could even say that the Urgals have been misunderstood all this time and \\nthat they are really friends and allies against such terrible enemies. I only \\nwonder what the king promised them in return for their services.”\\n“It wouldn’t \\nwork,” said Eragon, shaking his head. “No one could be deceived that easily \\nabout Galbatorix and the Urgals. Besides, why would he want to do that? He’s \\nalready in power.”\\n“But his \\nauthority is challenged by the Varden, with whom people sympathize. There’s \\nalso Surda, which has defied him since it seceded from the Empire. Galbatorix \\nis strong within the Empire, but his arm is weak outside of it. As for people \\nseeing through his deceptions, they’ll believe whatever he wants them to. It’s \\nhappened before.” Murtagh fell silent and gazed moodily into the distance.\\nHis words \\ntroubled Eragon. Saphira touched him with her mind:Where is Galbatorix \\nsending the Urgals?\\nWhat? \\nIn both \\nCarvahall and Teirm, you heard that Urgals were leaving the area and migrating \\nsoutheast, as if to brave the Hadarac Desert. If the king truly does control \\nthem, why is he sending them in that direction? Maybe an Urgal army is being \\ngathered for his private use or an Urgal city is being formed. \\nEragon shuddered \\nat the thought.I’m too tired to figure it out. Whatever Galbatorix’s plans, \\nthey’ll only cause us trouble. I just wish that we knew where the Varden are. \\nThat’s where we should be going, but we’re lost without Dormnad. It doesn’t \\nmatter what we do; the Empire will find us.\\nDon’t give up,she said \\nencouragingly, then added dryly,though you’re probably right.\\nThanks.He looked at \\nMurtagh. “You risked your life to rescue me; I owe you for that. I couldn’t \\nhave escaped on my own.” It was more than that, though. There was a bond \\nbetween them now, welded in the brotherhood of battle and tempered by the \\nloyalty Murtagh had shown.\\n“I’m just glad I \\ncould help. It . . .” Murtagh faltered and rubbed his face. “My main worry now \\nis how we’re going to travel with so many men searching for us. Gil’ead’s \\nsoldiers will be hunting us tomorrow; once they find the horses’ tracks, \\nthey’ll know you didn’t fly away with Saphira.”\\nEragon glumly \\nagreed. “How did you manage to get into the castle?”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nsoftly. “By paying a steep bribe and crawling through a filthy scullery chute. \\nBut the plan wouldn’t have worked without Saphira. She,” he stopped and \\ndirected his words at her, “that is, you, are the only reason we escaped \\nalive.”\\nEragon solemnly \\nput a hand on her scaly neck. As she hummed contentedly, he gazed at the elf’s \\nface, captivated. Reluctantly, he dragged himself upright. “We should make a \\nbed for her.”\\nMurtagh got to \\nhis feet and stretched out a blanket for the elf. When they lifted her onto it, \\nthe cuff of her sleeve tore on a branch. Eragon began to pinch the fabric \\ntogether, then gasped.\\nThe elf’s arm \\nwas mottled with a layer of bruises and cuts; some were half healed, while \\nothers were fresh and oozing. Eragon shook his head with anger and pulled the \\nsleeve up higher. The injuries continued to her shoulder. With trembling \\nfingers, he unlaced the back of her shirt, dreading what might be under it.\\nAs the leather \\nslipped off, Murtagh cursed. The elf’s back was strong and muscled, but it was \\ncovered with scabs that made her skin look like dry, cracked mud. She had been \\nwhipped mercilessly and branded with hot irons in the shape of claws. Where her \\nskin was still intact, it was purple and black from numerous beatings. On her \\nleft shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink. It was the same symbol \\nthat had been on the sapphire of Brom’s ring. Eragon silently swore an oath \\nthat he would kill whoever was responsible for torturing the elf.\\n“Can you heal \\nthis?” asked Murtagh.\\n“I—I don’t \\nknow,” said Eragon. He swallowed back sudden queasiness. “There’s so much.”\\nEragon!said Saphira \\nsharply.This is an elf. She cannot be allowed to die. Tired or not, hungry \\nor not, you must save her. I will meld my strength with yours, but you are the \\none who must wield the magic.\\nYes . . . you \\nare right,he \\nmurmured, unable to tear his eyes from the elf. Determined, he pulled off his \\ngloves and said to Murtagh, “This is going to take some time. Can you get me \\nfood? Also, boil rags for bandages; I can’t heal all her wounds.”\\n“We can’t make a \\nfire without being seen,” objected Murtagh. “You’ll have to use unwashed \\ncloths, and the food will be cold.” Eragon grimaced but acquiesced. As he \\ngently laid a hand on the elf’s spine, Saphira settled next to him, her \\nglittering eyes fixed on the elf. He took a deep breath, then reached for the \\nmagic and started working.\\nHe spoke the \\nancient words, “Waíse heill!” A burn shimmered under his palm, and new, \\nunmarked skin flowed over it, joining together without a scar. He passed over \\nbruises or other wounds that were not life-threatening—healing them all would \\nconsume the energy he needed for more serious injuries. As Eragon toiled, he \\nmarveled that the elf was still alive. She had been repeatedly tortured to the \\nedge of death with a precision that chilled him.\\nAlthough he \\ntried to preserve the elf’s modesty, he could not help but notice that \\nunderneath the disfiguring marks, her body was exceptionally beautiful. He was \\nexhausted and did not dwell upon it—though his ears turned red at times, and he \\nfervently hoped that Saphira did not know what he was thinking.\\nHe labored \\nthrough dawn, pausing only at brief intervals to eat and drink, trying to \\nreplenish himself from his fast, the escape, and now healing the elf. Saphira \\nremained by his side, lending her strength where she could. The sun was well \\ninto the sky when he finally stood, groaning as his cramped muscles stretched. \\nHis hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty. He stumbled to the \\nsaddlebags and took a long drink from the wineskin. “Is it done?” asked \\nMurtagh.\\nEragon nodded, \\ntrembling. He did not trust himself to speak. The camp spun before him; he \\nnearly fainted.You did well, said Saphira soothingly.\\n“Will she live?”\\n“I don’t—don’t \\nknow,” he said in a ravaged voice. “Elves are strong, but even they cannot \\nendure abuse like this with impunity. If I knew more about healing, I might be \\nable to revive her, but . . .” He gestured helplessly. His hand was shaking so \\nbadly he spilled some of the wine. Another swig helped to steady him. “We’d \\nbetter start riding again.”\\n“No! You must \\nsleep,” protested Murtagh.\\n“I . . . can \\nsleep in the saddle. But we can’t afford to stay here, not with the soldiers \\nclosing on us.”\\nMurtagh \\nreluctantly gave in. “In that case I’ll lead Snowfire while you rest.” They resaddled \\nthe horses, strapped the elf onto Saphira, and departed the camp. Eragon ate \\nwhile he rode, trying to replace his depleted energy before he leaned forward \\nagainst Snowfire and closed his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nW ATER FROMSAND\\nWhen they stopped \\nfor the evening, Eragon felt no better and his temper had worsened. Most of the \\nday had been spent on long detours to avoid detection by soldiers with hunting \\ndogs. He dismounted Snowfire and asked Saphira,How is she?\\nI think no worse \\nthan before. She stirred slightly a few times, but that was all.Saphira crouched \\nlow to the ground to let him lift the elf out of the saddle. For a moment her \\nsoft form pressed against Eragon. Then he hurriedly put her down.\\nHe and Murtagh \\nmade a small dinner. It was difficult for them to fight off the urge to sleep. \\nWhen they had eaten, Murtagh said, “We can’t keep up this pace; we aren’t \\ngaining any ground on the soldiers. Another day or two of this and they’ll be \\nsure to overtake us.”\\n“What else can \\nwe do?” snapped Eragon. “If it were just the two of us and you were willing to \\nleave Tornac behind, Saphira could fly us out of here. But with the elf, too? \\nImpossible.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nat him carefully. “If you want to go your own way, I won’t stop you. I can’t \\nexpect you and Saphira to stay and risk imprisonment.”\\n“Don’t insult \\nme,” Eragon muttered. “The only reason I’m free is because of you. I’m not \\ngoing to abandon you to the Empire. Poor thanks that would be!”\\nMurtagh bowed \\nhis head. “Your words hearten me.” He paused. “But they don’t solve our \\nproblem.”\\n“What can?” \\nEragon asked. He gestured at the elf. “I wish she could tell us where the elves \\nare; perhaps we could seek sanctuary with them.”\\n“Considering how \\nthey’ve protected themselves, I doubt she’d reveal their location. Even if she \\ndid, the others of her kind might not welcome us. Why would they want to \\nshelter us anyway? The last Riders they had contact with were Galbatorix and \\nthe Forsworn. I doubt that left them with pleasant memories. And I don’t even \\nhave the dubious honor of being a Rider like you. No, they would not want me at \\nall.”\\nThey would \\naccept us,said \\nSaphira confidently as she shifted her wings to a more comfortable position.\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“Even if they would protect us, we can’t find them, and it’s impossible to ask \\nthe elf until she regains consciousness. We must flee, but in which \\ndirection—north, south, east, or west?”\\nMurtagh laced \\nhis fingers together and pressed his thumbs against his temples. “I think the \\nonly thing we can do is leave the Empire. The few safe places within it are far \\nfrom here. They would be difficult to reach without being caught or followed. . \\n. . There’s nothing for us to the north except the forest Du Weldenvarden—which \\nwe might be able to hide in, but I don’t relish going back past Gil’ead. Only \\nthe Empire and the sea lie westward. To the south is Surda, where you might be \\nable to find someone to direct you to the Varden. As for going east . . .” He \\nshrugged. “To the east, the Hadarac Desert stands between us and whatever lands \\nexist in that direction. The Varden are somewhere across it, but without \\ndirections it might take us years to find them.”\\nWe would be \\nsafe, though,remarked \\nSaphira.As long as we didn’t encounter any Urgals.\\nEragon knitted \\nhis brow. A headache threatened to drown his thoughts in hot throbs. “It’s too \\ndangerous to go to Surda. We would have to traverse most of the Empire, \\navoiding every town and village. There are too many people between us and Surda \\nto get there unnoticed.”\\nMurtagh raised \\nan eyebrow. “So you want to go across the desert?”\\n“I don’t see any \\nother options. Besides, that way we can leave the Empire before the Ra’zac get \\nhere. With their flying steeds, they’ll probably arrive in Gil’ead in a couple \\nof days, so we don’t have much time.”\\n“Even if we do \\nreach the desert before they get here,” said Murtagh, “they could still \\novertake us. It’ll be hard to outdistance them at all.”\\nEragon rubbed \\nSaphira’s side, her scales rough under his fingers. “That’s assuming they can \\nfollow our trail. To catch us, though, they’ll have to leave the soldiers \\nbehind, which is to our advantage. If it comes to a fight, I think the three of \\nus can defeat them . . . as long as we aren’t ambushed the way Brom and I \\nwere.”\\n“If we reach the \\nother side of the Hadarac safely,” said Murtagh slowly, “where will we go? \\nThose lands are well outside of the Empire. There will be few cities, if any. \\nAnd then there is the desert itself. What do you know of it?”\\n“Only that it’s \\nhot, dry, and full of sand,” confessed Eragon.\\n“That about sums \\nit up,” replied Murtagh. “It’s filled with poisonous and inedible plants, \\nvenomous snakes, scorpions, and a blistering sun. You saw the great plain on \\nour way to Gil’ead?”\\nIt was a rhetorical \\nquestion, but Eragon answered anyway, “Yes, and once before.”\\n“Then you are \\nfamiliar with its immense range. It fills the heart of the Empire. Now imagine \\nsomething two or three times its size, and you’ll understand the vastness of \\nthe Hadarac Desert. That is what you’re proposing to cross.”\\nEragon tried to \\nenvision a piece of land that gigantic but was unable to grasp the distances \\ninvolved. He retrieved the map of Alagaësia from his saddlebags. The parchment \\nsmelled musty as he unrolled it on the ground. He inspected the plains and \\nshook his head in amazement. “No wonder the Empire ends at the desert. \\nEverything on the other side is too far away for Galbatorix to control.”\\nMurtagh swept \\nhis hand over the right side of the parchment. “All the land beyond the desert, \\nwhich is blank on this map, was under one rule when the Riders lived. If the \\nking were to raise up new Riders under his command, it would allow him to \\nexpand the Empire to an unprecedented size. But that wasn’t the point I was \\ntrying to make. The Hadarac Desert is so huge and contains so many dangers, the \\nchances are slim that we can cross it unscathed. It is a desperate path to \\ntake.”\\n“Weare \\ndesperate,” said Eragon firmly. He studied the map carefully. “If we rode \\nthrough the belly of the desert, it would take well over a month, perhaps even \\ntwo, to cross it. But if we angle southeast, toward the Beor Mountains, we \\ncould cut through much faster. Then we can either follow the Beor Mountains \\nfarther east into the wilderness or go west to Surda. If this map is accurate, \\nthe distance between here and the Beors is roughly equal to what we covered on \\nour way to Gil’ead.”\\n“But that took \\nus nearly a month!”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead impatiently. “Our ride to Gil’ead was slow on account of my injuries. If we \\npress ourselves, it’ll take only a fraction of that time to reach the Beor \\nMountains.”\\n“Enough. You \\nmade your point,” acknowledged Murtagh. “Before I consent, however, something \\nmust be solved. As I’m sure you noticed, I bought supplies for us and the horses \\nwhile I was in Gil’ead. But how can we get enough water? The roving tribes who \\nlive in the Hadarac usually disguise their wells and oases so no one can steal \\ntheir water. And carrying enough for more than a day is impractical. Just think \\nabout how much Saphira drinks! She and the horses consume more water at one \\ntime than we do in a week. Unless you can make it rain whenever we need, I \\ndon’t see how we can go the direction you propose.”\\nEragon rocked \\nback on his heels. Making rain was well beyond his power. He suspected that not \\neven the strongest Rider could have done it. Moving that much air was like \\ntrying to lift a mountain. He needed a solution that would not drain all of his \\nstrength.I wonder if it’s possible to convert sand into water? That would \\nsolve our problem, but only if it doesn’t take too much energy.\\n“I have an \\nidea,” he said. “Let me experiment, then I’ll give you an answer.” Eragon \\nstrode out of the camp, with Saphira following closely.\\nWhat are you \\ngoing to try?she \\nasked.\\n“I don’t know,” \\nhe muttered.Saphira, could you carry enough water for us?\\nShe shook her \\nenormous head.No, I wouldn’t even be able to lift that much weight, let \\nalone fly with it.\\nToo bad.He knelt and \\npicked up a stone with a cavity large enough for a mouthful of water. He \\npressed a clump of dirt into the hollow and studied it thoughtfully. Now came \\nthe hard part. Somehow he had to convert the dirt into water.But what words \\nshould I use? He puzzled over it for a moment, then picked two he hoped \\nwould work. The icy magic rushed through him as he breached the familiar \\nbarrier in his mind and commanded, “Deloi moi!”\\nImmediately the \\ndirt began to absorb his strength at a prodigious rate. Eragon’s mind flashed \\nback to Brom’s warning that certain tasks could consume all of his power and \\ntake his life. Panic blossomed in his chest. He tried to release the magic but \\ncould not. It was linked to him until the task was complete or he was dead. All \\nhe could do was remain motionless, growing weaker every moment.\\nJust as he \\nbecame convinced that he would die kneeling there, the dirt shimmered and \\nmorphed into a thimbleful of water. Relieved, Eragon sat back, breathing hard. \\nHis heart pounded painfully and hunger gnawed at his innards.\\nWhat happened?asked Saphira.\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, still in shock from the drain on his body’s reserves. He was glad that he \\nhad not tried to transmute anything larger.This . . . this won’t work, \\nhe said.I don’t even have the strength to give myself a drink.\\nYou should have \\nbeen more careful,she \\nchided.Magic can yield unexpected results when the ancient words are \\ncombined in new ways.\\nHe glared at \\nher.I know that, but this was the only way I could test my idea. I wasn’t \\ngoing to wait until we were in the desert! He reminded himself that she was \\nonly trying to help.How did you turn Brom’s grave into diamond without \\nkilling yourself? I can barely handle a bit of dirt, much less all that \\nsandstone.\\nI don’t know how \\nI did it,she \\nstated calmly.It just happened.\\nCould you do it \\nagain, but this time make water? \\nEragon,she said, \\nlooking him squarely in the face.I’ve no more control over my abilities than \\na spider does. Things like that occur whether I will them or not. Brom told you \\nthat unusual events happen around dragons. He spoke truly. He gave no \\nexplanation for it, nor do I have one. Sometimes I can work changes just by \\nfeel, almost without thought. The rest of the time—like right now—I’m as \\npowerless as Snowfire.\\nYou’re never \\npowerless,he \\nsaid softly, putting a hand on her neck. For a long period they were both \\nquiet. Eragon remembered the grave he had made and how Brom lay within it. He \\ncould still see the sandstone flowing over the old man’s face. “At least we \\ngave him a decent burial,” he whispered.\\nHe idly swirled \\na finger in the dirt, making twisting ridges. Two of the ridges formed a \\nminiature valley, so he added mountains around it. With his fingernail he \\nscratched a river down the valley, then deepened it because it seemed too \\nshallow. He added a few more details until he found himself staring at a passable \\nreproduction of Palancar Valley. Homesickness welled up within him, and he \\nobliterated the valley with a swipe of his hand.\\nI don’t want to \\ntalk about it,he \\nmuttered angrily, staving off Saphira’s questions. He crossed his arms and \\nglared at the ground. Almost against his will, his eyes flicked back to where \\nhe had gouged the earth. He straightened, surprised. Though the ground was dry, \\nthe furrow he had made was lined with moisture. Curious, he scraped away more \\ndirt and found a damp layer a few inches under the surface. “Look at this!” he \\nsaid excitedly.\\nSaphira lowered \\nher nose to his discovery.How does this help us? Water in the desert is sure \\nto be buried so deeply we would have to dig for weeks to find it.\\nYes,said Eragon \\ndelightedly,but as long as it’s there, I can get it. Watch! He deepened \\nthe hole, then mentally accessed the magic. Instead of changing the dirt into \\nwater, he simply summoned forth the moisture that was already in the earth. \\nWith a faint trickle, water rushed into the hole. He smiled and sipped from it. \\nThe liquid was cool and pure, perfect for drinking.See! We can get all we \\nneed.\\nSaphira sniffed \\nthe pool.Here, yes. But in the desert? There may not be enough water in the \\nground for you to bring to the surface.\\nIt will work,Eragon assured \\nher.All I’m doing is lifting the water, an easy enough task. As long as it’s \\ndone slowly, my strength will hold. Even if I have to draw the water from fifty \\npaces down, it won’t be a problem. Especially if you help me.\\nSaphira looked \\nat him dubiously.Are you sure? Think carefully upon your answer, for it will \\nmean our lives if you are wrong.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then said firmly,I’m sure.\\nThen go tell \\nMurtagh. I will keep watch while you sleep. \\nBut you’ve \\nstayed up all night like us,he objected.You should rest.\\nI’ll be fine—I’m \\nstronger than you know,she said gently. Her scales rustled as she curled up \\nwith a watchful eye turned northward, toward their pursuers. Eragon hugged her, \\nand she hummed deeply, sides vibrating.Go.\\nHe lingered, \\nthen reluctantly returned to Murtagh, who asked, “Well? Is the desert open to \\nus?”\\n“It is,” \\nacknowledged Eragon. He flopped onto his blankets and explained what he had \\nlearned. When he finished, Eragon turned to the elf. Her face was the last \\nthing he saw before falling asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HERAMRRIVER\\nThey forced \\nthemselves to rise early in the gray predawn hours. Eragon shivered in the cool \\nair. “How are we going to transport the elf? She can’t ride on Saphira’s back \\nmuch longer without getting sores from her scales. Saphira can’t carry her in \\nher claws—it tires her and makes landing dangerous. A sledge won’t work; it \\nwould get battered to pieces while we ride, and I don’t want the horses slowed \\nby the weight of another person.”\\nMurtagh \\nconsidered the matter as he saddled Tornac. “If you were to ride Saphira, we \\ncould lash the elf onto Snowfire, but we’d have the same problem with sores.”\\nI have a \\nsolution,said \\nSaphira unexpectedly.Why don’t you tie the elf to my belly? I’ll still be \\nable to move freely, and she will be safer than anywhere else. The only danger \\nwill be if soldiers shoot arrows at me, but I can easily fly above those.\\nNone of them \\ncould come up with a better idea, so they quickly adopted hers. Eragon folded \\none of his blankets in half lengthwise, secured it around the elf’s petite \\nform, then took her to Saphira. Blankets and spare clothes were sacrificed to \\nform ropes long enough to encircle Saphira’s girth. With those ropes, the elf \\nwas tied back-first against Saphira’s belly, her head between Saphira’s front \\nlegs. Eragon looked critically at their handiwork. “I’m afraid your scales may \\nrub through the ropes.”\\n“We’ll have to \\ncheck them occasionally for fraying,” commented Murtagh.\\nShall we go now?Saphira asked, \\nand Eragon repeated the question.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nsparked dangerously, a tight smile lifting his lips. He glanced back the way \\nthey had come, where smoke from soldiers’ camps was clearly visible, and said, \\n“I always did like races.”\\n“And now we are \\nin one for our lives!”\\nMurtagh swung \\ninto Tornac’s saddle and trotted out of the camp. Eragon followed close behind \\non Snowfire. Saphira jumped into the air with the elf. She flew low to the \\nground to avoid being seen by the soldiers. In this fashion, the three of them \\nmade their way southeast toward the distant Hadarac Desert.\\nEragon kept a \\nquick eye out for pursuers as he rode. His mind repeatedly wandered back to the \\nelf.An elf! He had actually seen one, and she was with them! He wondered \\nwhat Roran would think of that. It struck him that if he ever returned to \\nCarvahall, he would have a hard time convincing anyone that his adventures had \\nactually occurred.\\n\\xa0\\nFor the rest of \\nthe day, Eragon and Murtagh sped through the land, ignoring discomfort and fatigue. \\nThey drove the horses as hard as they could without killing them. Sometimes \\nthey dismounted and ran on foot to give Tornac and Snowfire a rest. Only twice \\ndid they stop—both times to let the horses eat and drink.\\nThough the \\nsoldiers of Gil’ead were far behind now, Eragon and Murtagh found themselves \\nhaving to avoid new soldiers every time they passed a town or village. Somehow \\nthe alarm had been sent ahead of them. Twice they were nearly ambushed along \\nthe trail, escaping only because Saphira happened to smell the men ahead of \\nthem. After the second incident, they avoided the trail entirely.\\nDusk softened \\nthe countryside as evening drew a black cloak across the sky. Through the night \\nthey traveled, relentlessly pacing out the miles. In the deepest hours of \\nnight, the ground rose beneath them to form low cactus-dotted hills.\\nMurtagh pointed \\nforward. “There’s a town, Bullridge, some leagues ahead that we must bypass. \\nThey’re sure to have soldiers watching for us. We should try to slip past them \\nnow while it’s dark.”\\nAfter three \\nhours they saw the straw-yellow lanterns of Bullridge. A web of soldiers \\npatrolled between watch fires scattered around the town. Eragon and Murtagh \\nmuffled their sword sheaths and carefully dismounted. They led the horses in a \\nwide detour around Bullridge, listening attentively to avoid stumbling on an \\nencampment.\\nWith the town \\nbehind them, Eragon relaxed slightly. Daybreak finally flooded the sky with a \\ndelicate blush and warmed the chilly night air. They halted on the crest of a hill \\nto observe their surroundings. The Ramr River was to their left, but it was \\nalso five miles to their right. The river continued south for several leagues, \\nthen doubled back on itself in a narrow loop before curving west. They had \\ncovered over sixteen leagues in one day.\\nEragon leaned \\nagainst Snowfire’s neck, happy with the distance they had gone. “Let’s find a \\ngully or hollow where we can sleep undisturbed.” They stopped at a small stand \\nof juniper trees and laid their blankets beneath them. Saphira waited patiently \\nas they untied the elf from her belly.\\n“I’ll take the \\nfirst watch and wake you at midmorning,” said Murtagh, setting his bare sword \\nacross his knees. Eragon mumbled his assent and pulled the blankets over his \\nshoulders.\\n\\xa0\\nNightfall found \\nthem worn and drowsy but determined to continue. As they prepared to leave, \\nSaphira observed to Eragon,This is the third night since we rescued you from \\nGil’ead, and the elf still hasn’t woken. I’m worried. And, she continued,she \\nhas neither drunk nor eaten in that time. I know little of elves, but she is \\nslender, and I doubt she can survive much longer without nourishment.\\n“What’s wrong?” \\nasked Murtagh over Tornac’s back.\\n“The elf,” said \\nEragon, looking down at her. “Saphira is troubled that she hasn’t woken or \\neaten; it disturbs me too. I healed her wounds, at least on the surface, but it \\ndoesn’t seem to have done her any good.”\\n“Maybe the Shade \\ntampered with her mind,” suggested Murtagh.\\n“Then we have to \\nhelp her.”\\nMurtagh knelt by \\nthe elf. He examined her intently, then shook his head and stood. “As far as I \\ncan tell, she’s only sleeping. It seems as if I could wake her with a word or a \\ntouch, yet she slumbers on. Her coma might be something elves self-induce to \\nescape the pain of injury, but if so, why doesn’t she end it? There’s no danger \\nto her now.”\\n“But does she \\nknow that?” asked Eragon quietly.\\nMurtagh put a \\nhand on his shoulder. “This must wait. We have to leave now or risk losing our \\nhard-won lead. You can tend to her later when we stop.”\\n“One thing first,” \\nsaid Eragon. He soaked a rag, then squeezed the cloth so water dripped between \\nthe elf’s sculpted lips. He did that several times and dabbed above her \\nstraight, angled eyebrows, feeling oddly protective.\\n\\xa0\\nThey headed \\nthrough the hills, avoiding the tops for fear of being spotted by sentries. \\nSaphira stayed with them on the ground for the same reason. Despite her bulk, \\nshe was stealthy; only her tail could be heard scraping over the ground, like a \\nthick blue snake.\\nEventually the \\nsky brightened in the east. The morning star Aiedail appeared as they reached \\nthe edge of a steep bank covered with mounds of brush. Water roared below as it \\ntore over boulders and sluiced through branches.\\n“The Ramr!” said \\nEragon over the noise.\\nMurtagh nodded. \\n“Yes! We have to find a place to ford safely.”\\nThat isn’t \\nnecessary,said \\nSaphira.I can carry you across, no matter how wide the river is.\\nEragon looked up \\nat her blue-gray form.What about the horses? We can’t leave them behind. \\nThey’re too heavy for you to lift.\\nAs long as \\nyou’re not on them and they don’t struggle too much, I’m sure that I can carry \\nthem. If I can dodge arrows with three people on my back, I can certainly fly a \\nhorse in a straight line over a river. \\nI believe you, \\nbut let’s not attempt it unless we have to. It’s too dangerous. \\nShe clambered \\ndown the embankment.We can’t afford to squander time here.\\nEragon followed \\nher, leading Snowfire. The bank came to an abrupt end at the Ramr, where the \\nriver ran dark and swift. White mist wafted up from the water, like blood \\nsteaming in winter. It was impossible to see the far side. Murtagh tossed a \\nbranch into the torrent and watched it race away, bobbing on the rough water.\\n“How deep do you \\nthink it is?” asked Eragon.\\n“I can’t tell,” \\nsaid Murtagh, worry coloring his voice. “Can you see how far across it is with \\nmagic?”\\n“I don’t think \\nso, not without lighting up this place like a beacon.”\\nWith a gust of \\nair, Saphira took off and soared over the Ramr. After a short time, she said,I’m \\non the other bank. The river is over a half-mile wide. You couldn’t have chosen \\na worse place to cross; the Ramr bends at this point and is at its widest.\\n“A half-mile!” \\nexclaimed Eragon. He told Murtagh about Saphira’s offer to fly them.\\n“I’d rather not \\ntry it, for the horses’ sake. Tornac isn’t as accustomed to Saphira as \\nSnowfire. He might panic and injure them both. Ask Saphira to look for shallows \\nwhere we can swim over safely. If there aren’t any within a mile in either \\ndirection, then I suppose she can ferry us.”\\nAt Eragon’s request, \\nSaphira agreed to search for a ford. While she explored, they hunkered next to \\nthe horses and ate dry bread. It was not long before Saphira returned, her \\nvelvet wings whispering in the early dawn sky.The water is both deep and \\nstrong, upstream as well as downstream.\\nOnce he was \\ntold, Murtagh said, “I’d better go over first, so I can watch the horses.” He \\nscrambled onto Saphira’s saddle. “Be careful with Tornac. I’ve had him for many \\nyears. I don’t want anything to happen to him.” Then Saphira took off.\\nWhen she \\nreturned, the unconscious elf had been untied from her belly. Eragon led Tornac \\nto Saphira, ignoring the horse’s low whinnies. Saphira reared back on her \\nhaunches to grasp the horse around the belly with her forelegs. Eragon eyed her \\nformidable claws and said, “Wait!” He repositioned Tornac’s saddle blanket, \\nstrapping it to the horse’s belly so it protected his soft underside, then \\ngestured for Saphira to proceed.\\nTornac snorted \\nin fright and tried to bolt when Saphira’s forelegs clamped around his sides, \\nbut she held him tightly. The horse rolled his eyes wildly, the whites rimming \\nhis dilated pupils. Eragon tried to gentle Tornac with his mind, but the \\nhorse’s panic resisted his touch. Before Tornac could try to escape again, \\nSaphira jumped skyward, her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws \\ngouged the rocks underneath. Her wings strained furiously, struggling to lift \\nthe enormous load. For a moment it seemed she would fall back to the ground. \\nThen, with a lunge, she shot into the air. Tornac screamed in terror, kicking \\nand tossing. It was a terrible sound, like screeching metal.\\nEragon swore, \\nwondering if anyone was close enough to hear.You’d better hurry, Saphira. \\nHe listened for soldiers as he waited, scanning the inky landscape for the \\ntelltale flash of torches. It soon met his eye in a line of horsemen sliding \\ndown a bluff almost a league away.\\nAs Saphira \\nlanded, Eragon brought Snowfire to her.Murtagh’s silly animal is in \\nhysterics. He had to tie Tornac down to prevent him from running away. She \\ngripped Snowfire and carried him off, ignoring the horse’s trumpeted \\nprotestations. Eragon watched her go, feeling lonely in the night. The horsemen \\nwere only a mile away.\\nFinally Saphira \\ncame for him, and they were soon on firm ground once more, with the Ramr to \\ntheir backs. Once the horses were calmed and the saddles readjusted, they \\nresumed their flight toward the Beor Mountains. The air filled with the calls \\nof birds waking to a new day.\\nEragon dozed \\neven when walking. He was barely aware that Murtagh was just as drowsy. There \\nwere times when neither of them guided the horses, and it was only Saphira’s \\nvigilance that kept them on course.\\nEventually the \\nground became soft and gave way under their feet, forcing them to halt. The sun \\nwas high overhead. The Ramr River was no more than a fuzzy line behind them.\\nThey had reached \\nthe Hadarac Desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEHADARACDESERT\\nAvast expanse of \\ndunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean. Bursts of wind twirled \\nthe reddish gold sand into the air. Scraggly trees grew on scattered patches of \\nsolid ground—ground any farmer would have declared unfit for crops. Rising in \\nthe distance was a line of purple crags. The imposing desolation was barren of \\nany animals except for a bird gliding on the zephyrs.\\n“You’re sure \\nwe’ll find food for the horses out there?” queried Eragon, slurring his words. \\nThe hot, dry air stung his throat.\\n“See those?” \\nasked Murtagh, indicating the crags. “Grass grows around them. It’s short and \\ntough, but the horses will find it sufficient.”\\n“I hope you’re \\nright,” said Eragon, squinting at the sun. “Before we continue, let’s rest. My \\nmind is slow as a snail, and I can barely move my legs.”\\nThey untied the \\nelf from Saphira, ate, then lay in the shadow of a dune for a nap. As Eragon \\nsettled into the sand, Saphira coiled up next to him and spread her wings over \\nthem.This is a wondrous place, she said.I could spend years here and \\nnot notice the passing time.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes.It would be a nice place to fly, he agreed drowsily.\\nNot only that, I \\nfeel as though I was made for this desert. It has the space I need, mountains \\nwhere I could roost, and camouflaged prey that I could spend days hunting. And \\nthe warmth! Cold does not disturb me, but this heat makes me feel alive and \\nfull of energy.She \\ncraned her head toward the sky, stretching happily.\\nYou like it that \\nmuch?mumbled \\nEragon.\\nYes. \\nThen when this \\nis all done, perhaps we can return. . . .He drifted into slumber even as \\nhe spoke. Saphira was pleased and hummed gently while he and Murtagh rested.\\nIt was the \\nmorning of the fourth day since leaving Gil’ead. They had already covered \\nthirty-five leagues.\\n\\xa0\\nThey slept just \\nlong enough to clear their minds and rest the horses. No soldiers could be seen \\nto the rear, but that did not lull them into slowing their pace. They knew that \\nthe Empire would keep searching until they were far beyond the king’s reach. \\nEragon said, “Couriers must have carried news of my escape to Galbatorix. He \\nwould have alerted the Ra’zac. They’re sure to be on our trail by now. It’ll \\ntake them a while to catch us even by flying, but we should be ready for them \\nat all times.”\\nAnd this time \\nthey will find I am not so easily bound with chains,said Saphira.\\nMurtagh \\nscratched his chin. “I hope they won’t be able to follow us past Bullridge. The \\nRamr was an effective way to lose pursuers; there’s a good chance our tracks \\nwon’t be found again.”\\n“Something to \\nhope for indeed,” said Eragon as he checked the elf. Her condition was \\nunchanged; she still did not react to his ministrations. “I place no faith in \\nluck right now, though. The Ra’zac could be on our trail even as we speak.”\\n\\xa0\\nAt sunset they \\narrived at the crags they had viewed from afar that morning. The imposing stone \\nbluffs towered over them, casting thin shadows. The surrounding area was free \\nof dunes for a half mile. Heat assailed Eragon like a physical blow as he \\ndismounted Snowfire onto the baked, cracked ground. The back of his neck and \\nhis face were sunburned; his skin was hot and feverish.\\nAfter picketing \\nthe horses where they could nibble the sparse grass, Murtagh started a small \\nfire. “How far do you think we went?” Eragon asked, releasing the elf from \\nSaphira.\\n“I don’t know!” \\nsnapped Murtagh. His skin was red, his eyes bloodshot. He picked up a pot and \\nmuttered a curse. “We don’t have enough water. And the horses have to drink.”\\nEragon was just \\nas irritated by the heat and dryness, but he held his temper in check. “Bring \\nthe horses.” Saphira dug a hole for him with her claws, then he closed his \\neyes, releasing the spell. Though the ground was parched, there was enough \\nmoisture for the plants to live on and enough for him to fill the hole several \\ntimes over.\\nMurtagh refilled \\nthe waterskins as water pooled in the hole, then stood aside and let the horses \\ndrink. The thirsty animals quaffed gallons. Eragon was forced to draw the \\nliquid from ever deeper in the earth to satisfy their desire. It taxed his \\nstrength to the limit. When the horses were finally sated, he said to Saphira,If \\nyou need a drink, take it now. Her head snaked around him and she took two \\nlong draughts, but no more.\\nBefore letting \\nthe water flow back into the ground, Eragon gulped down as much as he could, \\nthen watched the last drops melt back into the dirt. Holding the water on the \\nsurface was harder than he had expected.But at least it’s within my \\nabilities, he reflected, remembering with some amusement how he had once \\nstruggled to lift even a pebble.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was freezing \\nwhen they rose the next day. The sand had a pink hue in the morning light, and \\nthe sky was hazy, concealing the horizon. Murtagh’s mood had not improved with \\nsleep, and Eragon found his own rapidly deteriorating. During breakfast, he \\nasked, “Do you think it’ll be long before we leave the desert?”\\nMurtagh \\nglowered. “We’re only crossing a small section of it, so I can’t imagine that \\nit’ll take us more than two or three days.”\\n“But look how \\nfar we’ve already come.”\\n“All right, \\nmaybe it won’t! All I care about right now is getting out of the Hadarac as \\nquickly as possible. What we’re doing is hard enough without having to pick \\nsand from our eyes every few minutes.”\\nThey finished \\neating, then Eragon went to the elf. She lay as one dead—a corpse except for \\nher measured breathing. “Where lies your injury?” whispered Eragon, brushing a \\nstrand of hair from her face. “How can you sleep like this and yet live?” The \\nimage of her, alert and poised in the prison cell, was still vivid in his mind. \\nTroubled, he prepared the elf for travel, then saddled and mounted Snowfire.\\nAs they left the \\ncamp, a line of dark smudges became visible on the horizon, indistinct in the \\nhazy air. Murtagh thought they were distant hills. Eragon was not convinced, \\nbut he could make out no details.\\nThe elf’s plight \\nfilled his thoughts. He was sure that something had to be done to help her or \\nshe would die, though he knew not what that might be. Saphira was just as \\nconcerned. They talked about it for hours, but neither of them knew enough \\nabout healing to solve the problem confronting them.\\nAt midday they \\nstopped for a brief rest. When they resumed their journey, Eragon noticed that \\nthe haze had thinned since morning, and the distant smudges had gained \\ndefinition.\\nNo longer were \\nthey indistinct purple-blue lumps, but rather broad, forest-covered mounds with \\nclear outlines. The air above them was pale white, bleached of its usual \\nhue—all color seemed to have been leached out of a horizontal band of sky that \\nlay on top of the hills and extended to the horizon’s edges.\\nHe stared, \\npuzzled, but the more he tried to make sense of it, the more confused he \\nbecame. He blinked and shook his head, thinking that it must be some illusion \\nof the desert air. Yet when he opened his eyes, the annoying incongruity was \\nstill there. Indeed, the whiteness blanketed half the sky before them. Sure \\nthat something was terribly wrong, he started to point this out to Murtagh and \\nSaphira when he suddenly understood what he was seeing.\\nWhat they had \\ntaken to be hills were actually the bases of gigantic mountains, scores of \\nmiles wide. Except for the dense forest along their lower regions, the \\nmountains were entirely covered with snow and ice. It was this that had \\ndeceived Eragon into thinking the sky white. He craned back his neck, searching \\nfor the peaks, but they were not visible. The mountains stretched up into the \\nsky until they faded from sight. Narrow, jagged valleys with ridges that nearly \\ntouched split the mountains like deep gorges. It was like a ragged, toothy wall \\nlinking Alagaësia with the heavens.\\nThere’s no end \\nto them!he \\nthought, awestruck. Stories that mentioned the Beor Mountains always noted \\ntheir size, but he had discounted such reports as fanciful embellishments. Now, \\nhowever, he was forced to acknowledge their authenticity.\\nSensing his \\nwonder and surprise, Saphira followed his gaze with her own. Within a few \\nseconds she recognized the mountains for what they were.I feel like a \\nhatchling again. Compared to them, even I feel small!\\nWe must be near \\nthe edge of the desert,said Eragon.It’s only taken two days and we can \\nalready see the far side and beyond!\\nSaphira spiraled \\nabove the dunes.Yes, but considering the size of those peaks, they could \\nstill be fifty leagues from here. It’s hard to gauge distances against \\nsomething so immense. Wouldn’t they be a perfect hiding place for the elves or \\nthe Varden?\\nYou could hide \\nmore than the elves and Varden,he stated.Entire nations could exist \\nin secret there, hidden from the Empire. Imagine living with those behemoths \\nlooming over you!He guided Snowfire to Murtagh and pointed, grinning.\\n“What?” grunted \\nMurtagh, scanning the land.\\n“Look closely,” \\nurged Eragon.\\nMurtagh peered \\nclosely at the horizon. He shrugged. “What, I don’t—” The words died in his \\nmouth and gave way to slack-jawed wonder. Murtagh shook his head, muttering, \\n“That’s impossible!” He squinted so hard that the corners of his eyes crinkled. \\nHe shook his head again. “I knew the Beor Mountains were large, but not that \\nmonstrous size!”\\n“Let’s hope the \\nanimals that live there aren’t in proportion to the mountains,” said Eragon \\nlightly.\\nMurtagh smiled. \\n“It will be good to find some shade and spend a few weeks in leisure. I’ve had \\nenough of this forced march.”\\n“I’m tired too,” \\nadmitted Eragon, “but I don’t want to stop until the elf is cured . . . or she \\ndies.”\\n“I don’t see how \\ncontinuing to travel will help her,” said Murtagh gravely. “A bed will do her \\nmore good than hanging underneath Saphira all day.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“Maybe . . . When we reach the mountains, I could take her to Surda—it’s not \\nthat far. There must be a healer there who can help her; we certainly can’t.”\\nMurtagh shaded \\nhis eyes with his hand and stared at the mountains. “We can talk about it \\nlater. For now our goal is to reach the Beors. There, at least, the Ra’zac will \\nhave trouble finding us, and we will be safe from the Empire.”\\nAs the day wore \\non, the Beor Mountains seemed to get no closer, though the landscape changed \\ndramatically. The sand slowly transformed from loose grains of reddish hue to \\nhard-packed, dusky-cream dirt. In place of dunes were ragged patches of plants \\nand deep furrows in the ground where flooding had occurred. A cool breeze \\nwafted through the air, bringing welcome refreshment. The horses sensed the \\nchange of climate and hurried forward eagerly.\\nWhen evening \\nsubdued the sun, the mountains’ foothills were a mere league away. Herds of \\ngazelles bounded through lush fields of waving grass. Eragon caught Saphira \\neyeing them hungrily. They camped by a stream, relieved to be out of the \\npunishing Hadarac Desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAP ATHREVEALED\\nFatigued and \\nhaggard, but with triumphant smiles, they sat around the fire, congratulating \\neach other. Saphira crowed jubilantly, which startled the horses. Eragon stared \\nat the flames. He was proud that they had covered roughly sixty leagues in five \\ndays. It was an impressive feat, even for a rider able to change mounts \\nregularly.\\nI am outside of \\nthe Empire.It \\nwas a strange thought. He had been born in the Empire, lived his entire life \\nunder Galbatorix’s rule, lost his closest friends and family to the king’s \\nservants, and had nearly died several times within his domain. Now Eragon was \\nfree. No more would he and Saphira have to dodge soldiers, avoid towns, or hide \\nwho they were. It was a bittersweet realization, for the cost had been the loss \\nof his entire world.\\nHe looked at the \\nstars in the gloaming sky. And though the thought of building a home in the \\nsafety of isolation appealed to him, he had witnessed too many wrongs committed \\nin Galbatorix’s name, from murder to slavery, to turn his back on the Empire. \\nNo longer was it just vengeance—for Brom’s death as well as Garrow’s—that drove \\nhim. As a Rider, it was his duty to assist those without strength to resist \\nGalbatorix’s oppression.\\nWith a sigh he \\nabandoned his deliberation and observed the elf stretched out by Saphira. The fire’s \\norange light gave her face a warm cast. Smooth shadows flickered under her \\ncheekbones. As he stared, an idea slowly came to him.\\nHe could hear \\nthe thoughts of people and animals—and communicate with them in that manner if \\nhe chose to—but it was something he had done infrequently except with Saphira. \\nHe always remembered Brom’s admonishment not to violate someone’s mind unless \\nabsolutely necessary. Save for the one time he had tried to probe Murtagh’s \\nconsciousness, he had refrained from doing so.\\nNow, however, he \\nwondered if it were possible to contact the elf in her comatose state.I \\nmight be able to learn from her memories why she remains like this. But if she \\nrecovers, would she forgive me for such an intrusion? . . . Whether she does or \\nnot, I must try. She’s been in this condition for almost a week. Without \\nspeaking of his intentions to Murtagh or Saphira, he knelt by the elf and \\nplaced his palm on her brow.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes and extended a tendril of thought, like a probing finger, toward the elf’s \\nmind. He found it without difficulty. It was not fuzzy and filled with pain as \\nhe had anticipated, but lucid and clear, like a note from a crystal bell. \\nSuddenly an icy dagger drove into his mind. Pain exploded behind his eyes with \\nsplashes of color. He recoiled from the attack but found himself held in an \\niron grip, unable to retreat.\\nEragon fought as \\nhard as he could and used every defense he could think of. The dagger stabbed \\ninto his mind again. He frantically threw his own barriers before it, blunting \\nthe attack. The pain was less excruciating than the first time, but it jarred \\nhis concentration. The elf took the opportunity to ruthlessly crush his \\ndefenses.\\nA stifling \\nblanket pressed down on Eragon from all directions, smothering his thoughts. The \\noverpowering force slowly contracted, squeezing the life out of him bit by bit, \\nthough he held on, unwilling to give up.\\nThe elf \\ntightened her relentless grip even more, so as to extinguish him like a snuffed \\ncandle. He desperately cried in the ancient language, “Eka aí fricai un \\nShur’tugal!” I am a Rider and friend! The deadly embrace did not loosen its \\nhold, but its constriction halted and surprise emanated from her.\\nSuspicion \\nfollowed a second later, but he knew she would believe him; he could not have \\nlied in the ancient language. However, while he had said he was a friend, that \\ndid not mean he meant her no harm. For all she knew, Eragon believed himself to \\nbe her friend, making the statement true for him, thoughshe might not \\nconsider him one.The ancient language does have its limitations, thought \\nEragon, hoping that the elf would be curious enough to risk freeing him.\\nShe was. The \\npressure lifted, and the barriers around her mind hesitantly lowered. The elf \\nwarily let their thoughts touch, like two wild animals meeting for the first \\ntime. A cold shiver ran down Eragon’s side. Her mind was alien. It felt vast \\nand powerful, weighted with memories of uncounted years. Dark thoughts loomed \\nout of sight and touch, artifacts of her race that made him cringe when they \\nbrushed his consciousness. Yet through all the sensations shimmered a melody of \\nwild, haunting beauty that embodied her identity.\\nWhat is your \\nname?she \\nasked, speaking in the ancient language. Her voice was weary and filled with \\nquiet despair.\\nEragon. And \\nyours?Her \\nconsciousness lured him closer, inviting him to submerge himself in the lyric \\nstrains of her blood. He resisted the summons with difficulty, though his heart \\nached to accept it. For the first time he understood the fey attraction of elves. \\nThey were creatures of magic, unbound by the mortal laws of the land—as \\ndifferent from humans as dragons were from animals.\\n. . . Arya. Why \\nhave you contacted me in this manner? Am I still a captive of theEmpire? \\nNo, you are \\nfree!said \\nEragon. Though he knew only scattered words in the ancient language, he managed \\nto convey:I was imprisoned in Gil’ead, like you, but I escaped and rescued \\nyou. In the five days since then, we’ve crossed the edge of the Hadarac Desert \\nand are now camped by the Beor Mountains. You’ve not stirred nor said a word in \\nall that time.\\nAh . . . so it \\nwas Gil’ead.She \\npaused.I know that my wounds were healed. At the time I did not understand \\nwhy—preparation for some new torture, I was certain. Now I realize it was you. \\nSoftly she added,Even so, I have not risen, and you are puzzled.\\nYes. \\nDuring my \\ncaptivity, a rare poison, the Skilna Bragh, was given to me, along with the \\ndrug to suppress my power. Every morning the antidote for the previous day’s \\npoison was administered to me, by force if I refused to take it. Without it I \\nwill die within a few hours. That is why I lie in this trance—it slows the \\nSkilna Bragh’s progress, though does not stop it. . . . I contemplated waking \\nfor the purpose of ending my life and denyingGalbatorix, but I refrained from \\ndoing so out of hope that you might be an ally. . . .Her voice \\ndwindled off weakly.\\nHow long can you \\nremain like this?asked \\nEragon.\\nFor weeks, but \\nI’m afraid I haven’t that much time. This dormancy cannot restrain death \\nforever . . . I can feel it in my veins even now. Unless I receive the \\nantidote, I will succumb to the poison in three or four days. \\nWhere can the \\nantidote be found?\\n\\nIt exists in \\nonly two places outside of the Empire: with my own people and with the Varden. \\nHowever, my home is beyond the reach of dragonback. \\nWhat about the \\nVarden? We would have taken you straight to them, but we don’t know where they \\nare.\\n\\nI will tell \\nyou—if you give me your word that you will never reveal their location to \\nGalbatorix or to anyone who serves him. In addition you must swear that you \\nhave not deceived me in some manner and that you intend no harm to the elves, \\ndwarves, Varden, or the race of dragons. \\nWhat Arya asked \\nfor would have been simple enough—if they had not been conversing in the \\nancient language. Eragon knew she wanted oaths more binding than life itself. \\nOnce made, they could never be broken. That weighed heavily on him as he \\ngravely pledged his word in agreement.\\nIt is \\nunderstood. . . .A \\nseries of vertigo-inducing images suddenly flashed through his mind. He found \\nhimself riding along the Beor Mountain range, traveling eastward many leagues. \\nEragon did his best to remember the route as craggy mountains and hills flashed \\npast. He was heading south now, still following the mountains. Then everything \\nwheeled abruptly, and he entered a narrow, winding valley. It snaked through \\nthe mountains to the base of a frothy waterfall that pounded into a deep lake.\\nThe images \\nstopped.It is far, said Arya,but do not let the distance dissuade \\nyou. When you arrive at the lake Kóstha-mérna at the end of the Beartooth \\nRiver, take a rock, bang on the cliff next to the waterfall, and cry, Aí \\nvarden abr du Shur’tugals gata vanta.You will be admitted. You will be \\nchallenged, but do not falter no matter how perilous it seems.\\nWhat should they \\ngive you for the poison?he asked.\\nHer voice \\nquavered, but then she regained her strength.Tell them—to give me Túnivor’s \\nNectar. You must leave me now . . . I have expended too much energy already. Do \\nnot talk with me again unless there is no hope of reaching the Varden. If that \\nis the case, there is information I must impart to you so the Varden will \\nsurvive. Farewell, Eragon, rider of dragons . . . my life is in your hands.\\nArya withdrew \\nfrom their contact. The unearthly strains that had echoed across their link \\nwere gone. Eragon took a shuddering breath and forced his eyes open. Murtagh \\nand Saphira stood on either side of him, watching with concern. “Are you all \\nright?” asked Murtagh. “You’ve been kneeling here for almost fifteen minutes.”\\n“I have?” asked \\nEragon, blinking.\\nYes, and \\ngrimacing like a pained gargoyle,commented Saphira dryly.\\nEragon stood, \\nwincing as his cramped knees stretched. “I talked with Arya!” Murtagh frowned \\nquizzically, as if to inquire if he had gone mad. Eragon explained, “The \\nelf—that’s her name.”\\nAnd what is it \\nthat ails her?asked \\nSaphira impatiently.\\nEragon swiftly \\ntold them of his entire discussion. “How far away are the Varden?” asked \\nMurtagh.\\n“I’m not exactly \\nsure,” confessed Eragon. “From what she showed me, I think it’s even farther \\nthan from here to Gil’ead.”\\n“And we’re \\nsupposed to cover that in three or four days?” demanded Murtagh angrily. “It \\ntook us fivelong days to get here! What do you want to do, kill the \\nhorses? They’re exhausted as it is.”\\n“But if we do \\nnothing, she’ll die! If it’s too much for the horses, Saphira can fly ahead \\nwith Arya and me; at least we would get to the Varden in time. You could catch \\nup with us in a few days.”\\nMurtagh grunted \\nand crossed his arms. “Of course. Murtagh the pack animal. Murtagh the horse \\nleader. I should have remembered that’s all I’m good for nowadays. Oh, and \\nlet’s not forget, every soldier in the Empire is searching for me now because \\nyou couldn’t defend yourself, and I had to go andsave you. Yes, I \\nsuppose I’ll just follow your instructions and bring up the horses in the rear \\nlike a good servant.”\\nEragon was \\nbewildered by the sudden venom in Murtagh’s voice. “What’s wrong with you? I’m \\ngrateful for what you did. There’s no reason to be angry with me! I didn’t ask \\nyou to accompany me or to rescue me from Gil’ead. You chose that. I haven’t \\nforced you to do anything.”\\n“Oh, not openly, \\nno. What else could I do but help you with the Ra’zac? And then later, at \\nGil’ead, how could I have left with a clear conscience? The problem with you,” \\nsaid Murtagh, poking Eragon in the chest, “is that you’re so totally helpless \\nyou force everyone to take care of you!”\\nThe words stung \\nEragon’s pride; he recognized a grain of truth in them. “Don’t touch me,” he \\ngrowled.\\nMurtagh laughed, \\na harsh note in his voice. “Or what, you’ll punch me? You couldn’t hit a brick \\nwall.” He went to shove Eragon again, but Eragon grabbed his arm and struck him \\nin the stomach.\\n“I said, don’t \\ntouch me!”\\nMurtagh doubled \\nover, swearing. Then he yelled and launched himself at Eragon. They fell in a \\ntangle of arms and legs, pounding on each other. Eragon kicked at Murtagh’s \\nright hip, missed, and grazed the fire. Sparks and burning embers scattered \\nthrough the air.\\nThey scrabbled \\nacross the ground, trying to get leverage. Eragon managed to get his feet under \\nMurtagh’s chest and kicked mightily. Murtagh flew upside down over Eragon’s \\nhead, landing flat on his back with a solid thump.\\nMurtagh’s breath \\nwhooshed out. He rolled stiffly to his feet, then wheeled to face Eragon, \\npanting heavily. They charged each other once more. Saphira’s tail slapped \\nbetween them, accompanied by a deafening roar. Eragon ignored her and tried to \\njump over her tail, but a taloned paw caught him in midair and flung him back \\nto the ground.\\nEnough! \\nHe futilely \\ntried to push Saphira’s muscled leg off his chest and saw that Murtagh was \\nlikewise pinned. Saphira roared again, snapping her jaws. She swung her head \\nover Eragon and glared at him.You of all people should know better! Fighting \\nlike starving dogs over a scrap of meat. What would Brom say?\\nEragon felt his \\ncheeks burn and averted his eyes. He knew what Brom would have said. Saphira \\nheld them on the ground, letting them simmer, then said to Eragon pointedly,Now, \\nif you don’t want to spend the night under my foot, you will politely ask \\nMurtagh what is troubling him. She snaked her head over to Murtagh and \\nstared down at him with an impassive blue eye.And tell him that I won’t \\nstand for insults from either of you.\\nWon’t you let us \\nup?complained \\nEragon.\\nNo. \\nEragon \\nreluctantly turned his head toward Murtagh, tasting blood in the side of his \\nmouth. Murtagh avoided his eyes and looked up at the sky. “Well, is she going to \\nget off us?”\\n“No, not unless \\nwe talk. . . . She wants me to ask you what’s really the problem,” said Eragon, \\nembarrassed.\\nSaphira growled \\nan affirmative and continued to stare at Murtagh. It was impossible for him to \\nescape her piercing glare. Finally he shrugged, muttering something under his \\nbreath. Saphira’s claws tightened on his chest, and her tail whistled through \\nthe air. Murtagh shot her an angry glance, then grudgingly said louder, “I told \\nyou before: I don’t want to go to the Varden.”\\nEragon frowned. \\nWas that all that was the matter? “Don’t want to . . . or can’t?”\\nMurtagh tried to \\nshove Saphira’s leg off him, then gave up with a curse. “Don’t want to! They’ll \\nexpect things from me that I can’t deliver.”\\n“Did you steal \\nsomething from them?”\\n“I wish it were \\nthat simple.”\\nEragon rolled \\nhis eyes, exasperated. “Well, what is it, then? Did you kill someone important \\nor bed the wrong woman?”\\n“No, I was \\nborn,” said Murtagh cryptically. He pushed at Saphira again. This time she \\nreleased them both. They got to their feet under her watchful eye and brushed \\ndirt from their backs.\\n“You’re avoiding \\nthe question,” Eragon said, dabbing his split lip.\\n“So what?” spat \\nMurtagh as he stomped to the edge of the camp. After a minute he sighed. “It \\ndoesn’t matter why I’m in this predicament, but I can tell you that the Varden \\nwouldn’t welcome me even if I came bearing the king’s head. Oh, they might \\ngreet me nicely enough and let me into their councils, but trust me? Never. And \\nif I were to arrive under less fortuitous circumstances, like the present ones, \\nthey’d likely clap me in irons.”\\n“Won’t you tell \\nme what this is about?” asked Eragon. “I’ve done things I’m not proud of, too, \\nso it’s not as if I’m going to pass judgment.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head slowly, eyes glistening. “It isn’t like that. I haven’tdone \\nanything to deserve this treatment, though it would have been easier to atone \\nfor if I had. No . . . my only wrongdoing is existing in the first place.” He \\nstopped and took a shaky breath. “You see, my father—”\\nA sharp hiss \\nfrom Saphira cut him off abruptly.Look!\\nThey followed \\nher gaze westward. Murtagh’s face paled. “Demons above and below!”\\nA league or so \\naway, parallel to the mountain range, was a column of figures marching east. \\nThe line of troops, hundreds strong, stretched for nearly a mile. Dust billowed \\nfrom their heels. Their weapons glinted in the dying light. A standard-bearer \\nrode before them in a black chariot, holding aloft a crimson banner.\\n“It’s the \\nEmpire,” said Eragon tiredly. “They’ve found us . . . somehow.” Saphira poked \\nher head over his shoulder and gazed at the column.\\n“Yes . . . but \\nthose are Urgals, not men,” said Murtagh.\\n“How can you \\ntell?”\\nMurtagh pointed \\nat the standard. “That flag bears the personal symbol of an Urgal chieftain. \\nHe’s a ruthless brute, given to violent fits and insanity.”\\n“You’ve met \\nhim?”\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\ntightened. “Once, briefly. I still have scars from that encounter. These Urgals \\nmight not have been sent here for us, but I’m sure we’ve been seen by now and \\nthat they will follow us. Their chieftain isn’t the sort to let a dragon escape \\nhis grasp, especially if he’s heard about Gil’ead.”\\nEragon hurried \\nto the fire and covered it with dirt. “We have to flee! You don’t want to go to \\nthe Varden, but I have to take Arya to them before she dies. Here’s a \\ncompromise: come with me until I reach the lake Kóstha-mérna, then go your own \\nway.” Murtagh hesitated. Eragon added quickly, “If you leave now, in sight of \\nthe column, Urgals will follow you. And then where will you be, facing them \\nalone?”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Murtagh, tossing his saddlebags over Tornac’s flanks, “but when we near \\nthe Varden, Iwill leave.”\\nEragon burned to \\nquestion Murtagh further, but not with Urgals so near. He gathered his \\nbelongings and saddled Snowfire. Saphira fanned her wings, took off in a rush, \\nand circled above. She kept guard over Murtagh and Eragon as they left camp.\\nWhat direction \\nshall I fly?she \\nasked.\\nEast, along the \\nBeors.\\n\\nStilling her \\nwings, Saphira rose on an updraft and teetered on the pillar of warm air, \\nhovering in the sky over the horses. I wonder why the Urgals are here. Maybe \\nthey were sent to attack the Varden.\\nThen we should \\ntry to warn them,he \\nsaid, guiding Snowfire past half-visible obstacles. As the night deepened, the \\nUrgals faded into the gloom behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAC LASH OFWILLS\\nWhen morning \\ncame, Eragon’s cheek was raw from chafing against Snowfire’s neck, and he was \\nsore from his fight with Murtagh. They had alternated sleeping in their saddles \\nthroughout the night. It had allowed them to outdistance the Urgal troops, but \\nneither of them knew if the lead could be retained. The horses were exhausted \\nto the point of stopping, yet they still maintained a relentless pace. Whether \\nit would be enough to escape depended on how rested the monsters were . . . and \\nif Eragon and Murtagh’s horses survived.\\nThe Beor \\nMountains cast great shadows over the land, stealing the sun’s warmth. To the \\nnorth was the Hadarac Desert, a thin white band as bright as noonday snow.\\nI must eat,said Saphira.Days \\nhave passed since I last hunted. Hunger claws my belly. If I start now, I might \\nbe able to catch enough of those bounding deer for a few mouthfuls.\\nEragon smiled at \\nher exaggeration.Go if you must, but leave Arya here.\\nI will be swift.He untied the \\nelf from her belly and transferred her to Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira soared \\naway, disappearing in the direction of the mountains. Eragon ran beside the \\nhorses, close enough to Snowfire to keep Arya from falling. Neither he nor \\nMurtagh intruded on the silence. Yesterday’s fight no longer seemed as \\nimportant because of the Urgals, but the bruises remained.\\n\\xa0\\nSaphira made her \\nkills within the hour and notified Eragon of her success. Eragon was pleased \\nthat she would soon return. Her absence made him nervous.\\nThey stopped at \\na pond to let the horses drink. Eragon idly plucked a stalk of grass, twirling \\nit while he stared at the elf. He was startled from his reverie by the steely \\nrasp of a sword being unsheathed. He instinctively grasped Zar’roc and spun around \\nin search of the enemy. There was only Murtagh, his long sword held ready. He \\npointed at a hill ahead of them, where a tall, brown-cloaked man sat on a \\nsorrel horse, mace in hand. Behind him was a group of twenty horsemen. No one \\nmoved. “Could they be Varden?” asked Murtagh.\\nEragon \\nsurreptitiously strung his bow. “According to Arya, they’re still scores of \\nleagues away. This might be one of their patrols or raiding groups.”\\n“Assuming \\nthey’re not bandits.” Murtagh swung onto Tornac and readied his own bow.\\n“Should we try \\nto outrun them?” asked Eragon, draping a blanket over Arya. The horsemen must \\nhave seen her, but he hoped to conceal the fact that she was an elf.\\n“It wouldn’t do \\nany good,” said Murtagh, shaking his head. “Tornac and Snowfire are fine \\nwar-horses, but they’re tired, and they aren’t sprinters. Look at the horses \\nthose men have; they’re meant for running. They would catch us before we had \\ngone a half-mile. Besides, they may have something important to say. You’d \\nbetter tell Saphira to hurry back.”\\nEragon was \\nalready doing that. He explained the situation, then warned,Don’t show \\nyourself unless it’s necessary. We’re not in the Empire, but I still don’t want \\nanyone to know about you.\\nNever mind that,she replied.Remember, \\nmagic can protect you where speed and luck fail. He felt her take off and \\nrace toward them, skimming close to the ground.\\nThe band of men \\nwatched them from the hill.\\nEragon nervously \\ngripped Zar’roc. The wire-wrapped hilt was secure under his glove. He said in a \\nlow voice, “If they threaten us, I can frighten them away with magic. If that \\ndoesn’t work, there’s Saphira. I wonder how they’d react to a Rider? So many \\nstories have been told about their powers. . . . It might be enough to avoid a fight.”\\n“Don’t count on \\nit,” said Murtagh flatly. “If there’s a fight, we’ll just have to kill enough \\nof them to convince them we’re not worth the effort.” His face was controlled \\nand unemotional.\\nThe man on the \\nsorrel horse signaled with his mace, sending the horsemen cantering toward \\nthem. The men shook javelins over their heads, whooping loudly as they neared. \\nBattered sheaths hung from their sides. Their weapons were rusty and stained. \\nFour of them trained arrows on Eragon and Murtagh.\\nTheir leader \\nswirled the mace in the air, and his men responded with yells as they wildly \\nencircled Eragon and Murtagh. Eragon’s lips twitched. He almost loosed a blast \\nof magic into their midst, then restrained himself.We don’t know what they \\nwant yet, he reminded himself, containing his growing apprehension.\\nThe moment \\nEragon and Murtagh were thoroughly surrounded, the leader reined in his horse, \\nthen crossed his arms and examined them critically. He raised his eyebrows. \\n“Well, these are better than the usual dregs we find! At least we got healthy \\nones this time. And we didn’t even have to shoot them. Grieg will be pleased.” \\nThe men chuckled.\\nAt his words, a \\nsinking sensation filled Eragon’s gut. A suspicion stirred in his mind.Saphira \\n. . .\\n“Now as for you \\ntwo,” said the leader, speaking to Eragon and Murtagh, “if you would be so good \\nas to drop your weapons, you’ll avoid being turned into living quivers by my \\nmen.” The archers grinned suggestively; the men laughed again.\\nMurtagh’s only \\nmovement was to shift his sword. “Who are you and what do you want? We are free \\nmen traveling through this land. You have no right to stop us.”\\n“Oh, I have \\nevery right,” said the man contemptuously. “And as for my name,slaves do \\nnot address their masters in that manner, unless they want to be beaten.”\\nEragon cursed to \\nhimself.Slavers! He remembered vividly the people he had seen at auction \\nin Dras-Leona. Rage boiled within him. He glared at the men around him with new \\nhatred and disgust.\\nThe lines \\ndeepened on the leader’s face. “Throw down your swords and surrender!” The \\nslavers tensed, staring at them with cold eyes as neither Eragon nor Murtagh \\nlowered his weapon. Eragon’s palm tingled. He heard a rustle behind him, then a \\nloud curse. Startled, he spun around.\\nOne of the \\nslavers had pulled the blanket off Arya, revealing her face. He gaped in \\nastonishment, then shouted, “Torkenbrand, this one’s an elf!” The men stirred \\nwith surprise while the leader spurred his horse over to Snowfire. He looked \\ndown at Arya and whistled.\\n“Well, ’ow much \\nis she worth?” someone asked.\\nTorkenbrand was \\nquiet for a moment, then spread his hands and said, “At the very least? \\nFortunes upon fortunes. The Empire will pay a mountain of gold for her!”\\nThe slavers \\nyelled with excitement and pounded each other on the back. A roar filled \\nEragon’s mind as Saphira banked sharply far overhead.Attack now! he \\ncried.But let them escape if they run. She immediately folded her wings \\nand plummeted downward. Eragon caught Murtagh’s attention with a sharp signal. \\nMurtagh took the cue. He smashed his elbow into a slaver’s face, knocking the \\nman out of his saddle, and jabbed his heels into Tornac.\\nWith a toss of \\nhis mane, the war-horse jumped forward, twirled around, and reared. Murtagh \\nbrandished his sword as Tornac plunged back down, driving his forehooves into \\nthe back of the dismounted slaver. The man screamed.\\nBefore the \\nslavers could gather their senses, Eragon scrambled out of the commotion and \\nraised his hands, invoking words in the ancient language. A globule of indigo \\nfire struck the ground in the midst of the fray, bursting into a fountain of \\nmolten drops that dissipated like sun-warmed dew. A second later, Saphira \\ndropped from the sky and landed next to him. She parted her jaws, displaying \\nher massive fangs, and bellowed. “Behold!” cried Eragon over the furor, “I am a \\nRider!” He raised Zar’roc over his head, the red blade dazzling in the \\nsunlight, then pointed it at the slavers. “Flee if you wish to live!”\\nThe men shouted \\nincoherently and scrambled over each other in their haste to escape. In the \\nconfusion, Torkenbrand was struck in the temple with a javelin. He tumbled to \\nthe ground, stunned. The men ignored their fallen leader and raced away in a \\nragged mass, casting fearful looks at Saphira.\\nTorkenbrand \\nstruggled to his knees. Blood ran from his temple, branching across his cheek \\nwith crimson tendrils. Murtagh dismounted and strode over to him, sword in \\nhand. Torkenbrand weakly raised his arm as if to ward off a blow. Murtagh gazed \\nat him coldly, then swung his blade at Torkenbrand’s neck. “No!” shouted \\nEragon, but it was too late.\\nTorkenbrand’s \\ndecapitated trunk crumpled to the ground in a puff of dirt. His head landed \\nwith a hard thump. Eragon rushed to Murtagh, his jaw working furiously. “Is \\nyour brain rotten?” he yelled, enraged. “Why did you kill him?”\\nMurtagh wiped \\nhis sword on the back of Torkenbrand’s jerkin. The steel left a dark stain. “I \\ndon’t see why you’re so upset—”\\n“Upset!” \\nexploded Eragon. “I’m well past that! Did it even occur to you that we could \\njust leave him here and continue on our way? No! Instead you turn into an \\nexecutioner and chop off his head. He was defenseless!”\\nMurtagh seemed \\nperplexed by Eragon’s wrath. “Well, we couldn’t keep him around—hewas dangerous. \\nThe others ran off . . . without a horse he wouldn’t have made it far. I didn’t \\nwant the Urgals to find him and learn about Arya. So I thought it would—”\\n“But tokill \\nhim?” interrupted Eragon. Saphira sniffed Torkenbrand’s head curiously. She opened \\nher mouth slightly, as if to snap it up, then appeared to decide better of it \\nand prowled to Eragon’s side.\\n“I’m only trying \\nto stay alive,” stated Murtagh. “No stranger’s life is more important than my \\nown.”\\n“But you can’t \\nindulge in wanton violence. Where is your empathy?” growled Eragon, pointing at \\nthe head.\\n“Empathy? \\nEmpathy? What empathy can I afford my enemies? Shall I dither about whether to \\ndefend myself because it will cause someone pain? If that had been the case, I \\nwould have died years ago! You must be willing to protect yourself and what you \\ncherish, no matter what the cost.”\\nEragon slammed \\nZar’roc back into its sheath, shaking his head savagely. “You can justify any \\natrocity with that reasoning.”\\n“Do you think I \\nenjoy this?” Murtagh shouted. “My life has been threatened from the day I was \\nborn! All of my waking hours have been spent avoiding danger in one form or \\nanother. And sleep never comes easily because I always worry if I’ll live to \\nsee the dawn. If there ever was a time I felt secure, it must have been in my \\nmother’s womb, though I wasn’t safe even there! You don’t understand—if you \\nlived with thisfear, you would have learned the same lesson I did:Do \\nnot take chances. ” He gestured at Torkenbrand’s body. “He was a risk that \\nI removed. I refuse to repent, and I won’t plague myself over what is done and \\npast.”\\nEragon shoved \\nhis face into Murtagh’s. “It was still the wrong thing to do.” He lashed Arya \\nto Saphira, then climbed onto Snowfire. “Let’s go.” Murtagh guided Tornac \\naround Torkenbrand’s prone form in the bloodstained dust.\\n\\xa0\\nThey rode at a \\nrate that Eragon would have thought impossible a week ago; leagues melted away \\nbefore them as if wings were attached to their feet. They turned south, between \\ntwo outstretched arms of the Beor Mountains. The arms were shaped like pincers \\nabout to close, the tips a day’s travel apart. Yet the distance seemed less \\nbecause of the mountains’ size. It was as if they were in a valley made for \\ngiants.\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the day, Eragon and Murtagh ate dinner in silence, refusing to look \\nup from their food. Afterward, Eragon said tersely, “I’ll take the first \\nwatch.” Murtagh nodded and lay on his blankets with his back to Eragon.\\nDo you want to \\ntalk?asked \\nSaphira.\\nNot right now,murmured Eragon.Give \\nme some time to think; I’m . . . confused.\\nShe withdrew \\nfrom his mind with a gentle touch and a whisper.I love you, little one.\\nAnd I you,he said. She \\ncurled into a ball next to him, lending him her warmth. He sat motionless in \\nthe dark, wrestling with his disquiet.\\nF LIGHTTHROUGHTHEVALLEY\\nIn the morning \\nSaphira took off with both Eragon and Arya. Eragon wanted to get away from \\nMurtagh for a time. He shivered, pulling his clothes tighter. It looked like it \\nmight snow. Saphira ascended lazily on an updraft and asked,What are you \\nthinking?\\nEragon \\ncontemplated the Beor Mountains, which towered above them even though Saphira \\nflew far above the ground.That was murder yesterday. I’ve no other word for \\nit.\\nSaphira banked \\nto the left. It was a hasty deed and ill considered, but Murtagh tried to do \\nthe right thing. The men who buy and sell other humans deserve every misfortune \\nthat befalls them. If we weren’t committed to helping Arya, I would hunt down \\nevery slaver and tear them apart!\\nYes,said Eragon \\nmiserably,but Torkenbrand was helpless. He couldn’t shield himself or run. A \\nmoment more and he probably would have surrendered. Murtagh didn’t give him \\nthat chance. If Torkenbrand had at least been able to fight, it wouldn’t have \\nbeen so bad.\\nEragon, even if \\nTorkenbrand had fought, the results would have been the same. You know as well \\nas I do that few can equal you or Murtagh with the blade. Torkenbrand would \\nhave still died, though you seem to think it would have been more just or honorable \\nin a mismatched duel.\\n\\nI don’t know \\nwhat’s right!admitted \\nEragon, distressed.There aren’t any answers that make sense.\\nSometimes,said Saphira \\ngently,there are no answers. Learn what you can about Murtagh from this. \\nThen forgive him. And if you can’t forgive, at least forget, for he meant you \\nno harm, however rash the act was. Your head is still attached, yes?\\nFrowning, Eragon \\nshifted in the saddle. He shook himself, like a horse trying to rid itself of a \\nfly, and checked Murtagh’s position over Saphira’s shoulder. A patch of color \\nfarther back along their route caught his attention.\\nCamped by a \\nstreambed they had crossed late yesterday were the Urgals. Eragon’s heartbeat \\nquickened. How could the Urgals be on foot, yet still gain on them? Saphira saw \\nthe monsters as well and tilted her wings, brought them close to her body, and \\nslipped into a steep dive, splitting the air.I don’t think they spotted us, \\nshe said.\\nEragon hoped \\nnot. He squinted against the blast of air as she increased the angle of their \\ndive.Their chieftain must be driving them at a breakneck pace, he said.\\nYes—maybe \\nthey’ll all die of exhaustion. \\nWhen they \\nlanded, Murtagh asked curtly, “What now?”\\n“The Urgals are \\novertaking us,” said Eragon. He pointed back toward the column’s camp.\\n“How far do we \\nstill have to go?” asked Murtagh, putting his hands against the sky and \\nmeasuring the hours until sunset.\\n“Normally? . . . \\nI would guess another five days. At the speed we’ve been traveling, only three. \\nBut unless we get there tomorrow, the Urgals will probably catch us, and Arya \\nwill certainly die.”\\n“She might last \\nanother day.”\\n“We can’t count \\non it,” objected Eragon. “The only way we can get to the Varden in time is if \\nwe don’t stop for anything, least of all sleep. That’s our only chance.”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nbitterly. “How can you expect to do that? We’ve already gone days without \\nadequate sleep. Unless Riders are made of different stuff than us mortals, \\nyou’re as tired as I am. We’ve covered a staggering distance, and the horses, \\nin case you haven’t noticed, are ready to drop. Another day of this might kill \\nus all.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“So be it. We don’t have a choice.”\\nMurtagh gazed at \\nthe mountains. “I could leave and let you fly ahead with Saphira. . . . That \\nwould force the Urgals to divide their troops and would give you a better \\nchance of reaching the Varden.”\\n“It would be \\nsuicide,” said Eragon, crossing his arms. “Somehow those Urgals are faster on \\nfoot than we are on horseback. They would run you down like a deer. The only \\nway to evade them is to find sanctuary with the Varden.” Despite his words, he \\nwas unsure if he wanted Murtagh to stay.I like him, Eragon confessed to \\nhimself,but I’m no longer certain if that’s a good thing.\\n“I’ll escape \\nlater,” said Murtagh abruptly. “When we get to the Varden, I can disappear down \\na side valley and find my way to Surda, where I can hide without attracting too \\nmuch attention.”\\n“So you’re \\nstaying?”\\n“Sleep or no \\nsleep, I’ll see you to the Varden,” promised Murtagh.\\n\\xa0\\nWith newfound \\ndetermination, they struggled to distance themselves from the Urgals, yet their \\npursuers continued to creep nearer. At nightfall the monsters were a third \\ncloser than they had been that morning. As fatigue eroded his and Murtagh’s \\nstrength, they slept in turns on the horses, while whoever was awake led the \\nanimals in the right direction.\\nEragon relied \\nheavily on Arya’s memories to guide them. Because of the alien nature of her \\nmind, he sometimes made mistakes as to the route, costing them precious time. \\nThey gradually angled toward the foothills of the eastern arm of mountains, \\nlooking for the valley that would lead them to the Varden. Midnight arrived and \\npassed without any sign of it.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen the sun \\nreturned, they were pleased to see that the Urgals were far behind. “This is \\nthe last day,” said Eragon, yawning widely. “If we’re not reasonably close to \\nthe Varden by noon, I’m going to fly ahead with Arya. You’ll be free to go \\nwherever you want then, but you’ll have to take Snowfire with you. I won’t be \\nable to come back for him.”\\n“That might not \\nbe necessary; we could still get there in time,” said Murtagh. He rubbed the \\npommel of his sword.\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“We could.” He went to Arya and put a hand on her forehead. It was damp and \\ndangerously hot. Her eyes wandered uneasily beneath her eyelids, as if she \\nsuffered a nightmare. Eragon pressed a damp rag to her brow, wishing he could \\ndo more.\\n\\xa0\\nLate in the \\nmorning, after they circumnavigated an especially broad mountain, Eragon saw a \\nnarrow valley tucked against its far side. The valley was so restricted it \\ncould easily be overlooked. The Beartooth River, which Arya had mentioned, \\nflowed out of it and looped carelessly across the land. He smiled with relief; \\nthat was where they needed to go.\\nLooking back, \\nEragon was alarmed to see that the distance between them and the Urgals had \\nshrunk to little more than a league. He pointed out the valley to Murtagh. “If \\nwe can slip in there without being seen, it might confuse them.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nskeptical. “It’s worth a try. But they’ve followed us easily enough so far.”\\nAs they \\napproached the valley, they passed under the knotted branches of the Beor \\nMountains’ forest. The trees were tall, with creviced bark that was almost \\nblack, dull needles of the same color, and knobby roots that rose from the soil \\nlike bare knees. Cones littered the ground, each the size of a horse’s head. \\nSable squirrels chattered from the treetops, and eyes gleamed from holes in the \\ntrunks. Green beards of tangled wolfsbane hung from the gnarled branches.\\nThe forest gave \\nEragon an uneasy feeling; the hair on the back of his neck prickled. There was \\nsomething hostile in the air, as if the trees resented their intrusion.They \\nare very old, said Saphira, touching a trunk with her nose.\\nYes,said Eragon,but \\nnot friendly. The forest grew denser the farther in they traveled. The lack \\nof space forced Saphira to take off with Arya. Without a clear trail to follow, \\nthe tough underbrush slowed Eragon and Murtagh. The Beartooth River wound next \\nto them, filling the air with the sound of gurgling water. A nearby peak \\nobscured the sun, casting them into premature dusk.\\nAt the valley’s \\nmouth, Eragon realized that although it looked like a slim gash between the \\npeaks, the valley was really as wide as many of the Spine’s vales. It was only \\nthe enormous size of the ridged and shadowy mountains that made it appear so \\nconfined. Waterfalls dotted its sheer sides. The sky was reduced to a thin \\nstrip winding overhead, mostly hidden by gray clouds. From the dank ground rose \\na clinging fog that chilled the air until their breath was visible. Wild \\nstrawberries crawled among a carpet of mosses and ferns, fighting for the \\nmeager sunlight. Sprouting on piles of rotting wood were red and yellow \\ntoadstools.\\nAll was hushed \\nand quiet, sounds dampened by the heavy air. Saphira landed by them in a nearby \\nglade, the rush of her wings strangely muted. She took in the view with a swing \\nof her head.I just passed a flock of birds that were black and green with \\nred markings on their wings. I’ve never seen birds like that before.\\nEverything in \\nthese mountains seems unusual,replied Eragon.Do you mind if I ride \\nyou awhile? I want to keep an eye on the Urgals.\\nOf course. \\nHe turned to \\nMurtagh. “The Varden are hidden at the end of this valley. If we hurry, we \\nmight get there before nightfall.”\\nMurtagh grunted, \\nhands on his hips. “How am I going to get out of here? I don’t see any valleys \\njoining this one, and the Urgals are going to hem us in pretty soon. I need an \\nescape route.”\\n“Don’t worry \\nabout it,” said Eragon impatiently. “This is a long valley; there’s sure to be \\nan exit further in.” He released Arya from Saphira and lifted the elf onto \\nSnowfire. “Watch Arya—I’m going to fly with Saphira. We’ll meet you up ahead.” \\nHe scrambled onto Saphira’s back and strapped himself onto her saddle.\\n“Be careful,” \\nMurtagh warned, his brow furrowed in thought, then clucked to the horses and \\nhurried back into the forest.\\nAs Saphira \\njumped toward the sky, Eragon said,Do you think you could fly up to one of \\nthose peaks? We might be able to spot our destination, as well as a passage for \\nMurtagh. I don’t want to listen to him griping through the entire valley.\\nWe can try,agreed Saphira,but \\nit will get much colder.\\nI’m dressed \\nwarmly.\\n\\nHold on, then!Saphira suddenly \\nswooped straight up, throwing him back in the saddle. Her wings flapped \\nstrongly, driving their weight upward. The valley shrank to a green line below \\nthem. The Beartooth River shimmered like braided silver where light struck it.\\nThey rose to the \\ncloud layer, and icy moisture saturated the air. A formless gray blanket \\nengulfed them, limiting their vision to an arm’s length. Eragon hoped they \\nwould not collide with anything in the murk. He stuck out a hand \\nexperimentally, swinging it through the air. Water condensed on it and ran down \\nhis arm, soaking his sleeve.\\nA blurred gray \\nmass fluttered past his head, and he glimpsed a dove, its wings pumping \\nfrantically. There was a white band around its leg. Saphira struck at the bird, \\ntongue lashing out, jaws gaping. The dove squawked as Saphira’s sharp teeth \\nsnapped together a hair’s breadth behind its tail feathers. Then it darted away \\nand disappeared into the haze, the frenzied thumping of its wings fading to \\nsilence.\\nWhen they breached \\nthe top of the clouds, Saphira’s scales were covered with thousands of water \\ndroplets that reflected tiny rainbows and shimmered with the blue of her \\nscales. Eragon shook himself, spraying water from his clothes, and shivered. He \\ncould no longer see the ground, only hills of clouds snaking between the \\nmountains.\\nThe trees on the \\nmountains gave way to thick glaciers, blue and white under the sun. The glare \\nfrom the snow forced Eragon to close his eyes. He tried to open them after a \\nminute, but the light dazzled him. Irritated, he stared into the crook of his \\narm.How can you stand it? he asked Saphira.\\nMy eyes are \\nstronger than yours,she \\nreplied.\\nIt was frigid. \\nThe water in Eragon’s hair froze, giving him a shiny helmet. His shirt and \\npants were hard shells around his limbs. Saphira’s scales became slick with \\nice; hoarfrost laced her wings. They had never flown this high before, yet the \\nmountaintops were still miles above them.\\nSaphira’s \\nflapping gradually slowed, and her breathing became labored. Eragon gasped and \\npanted; there didn’t seem to be enough air. Fighting back panic, he clutched \\nSaphira’s neck spikes for support.\\nWe . . . have to \\nget out of here,he \\nsaid. Red dots swam before his eyes.I can’t . . . breathe. Saphira \\nseemed not to hear him, so he repeated the message, louder this time. Again \\nthere was no response.She can’t hear me, he realized. He swayed, finding \\nit hard to think, then pounded on her side and shouted, “Take us down!”\\nThe effort made \\nhim lightheaded. His vision faded into swirling darkness.\\n\\xa0\\nHe regained \\nconsciousness as they emerged from the bottom of the clouds. His head was \\npounding.What happened? he asked, pushing himself upright and looking \\naround with confusion.\\nYou blacked out,answered \\nSaphira.\\nHe tried to run \\nhis fingers through his hair, but stopped when he felt icicles.Yes, I know \\nthat, but why didn’t you answer me?\\nMy brain was \\nconfused. Your words didn’t make any sense. When you lost consciousness, I knew \\nsomething was wrong and descended. I didn’t have to sink far before I realized \\nwhat had occurred.\\n\\nIt’s a good \\nthing you didn’t pass out as well,said Eragon with a nervous laugh. \\nSaphira only swished her tail. He looked wistfully at where the mountain peaks \\nwere now concealed by clouds.A pity we couldn’t stand upon one of those \\nsummits. . . . Well, now we know: we can only fly out of this valley the way we \\ncame in. Why did we run out of air? How can we have it down here, but not up \\nabove?\\nI don’t know, \\nbut I’ll never dare to fly so close to the sun again. We should remember this \\nexperience. The knowledge may be useful if we ever have to fight another Rider. \\nI hope that \\nnever happens,said \\nEragon.Let’s stay down below for now. I’ve had enough adventure for one day.\\nThey floated on \\nthe gentle air currents, drifting from one mountain to the next, until Eragon \\nsaw that the Urgal column had reached the valley’s mouth.What drives them to \\nsuch speed, and how can they bear to sustain it?\\nNow that we are \\ncloser to them,Saphira \\nsaid,I can see that these Urgals are bigger than the ones we’ve met before. \\nThey would stand chest and shoulders over a tall man. I don’t know what land \\nthey march from, but it must be a fierce place to produce such brutes.\\nEragon glared at \\nthe ground below—he could not see the detail that she did.If they keep to \\nthis pace, they’ll catch Murtagh before we find the Varden.\\nHave hope. The \\nforest may hamper their progress. . . . Would it be possible to stop them with \\nmagic?\\n\\nEragon shook his \\nhead.Stop them . . . no. There are too many. He thought of the thin \\nlayer of mist on the valley floor and grinned.But I might be able to delay \\nthem a bit. He closed his eyes, selected the words he needed, stared at the \\nmist, and then commanded, “Gath un reisa du rakr!”\\nThere was a \\ndisturbance below. From above, it looked as if the ground was flowing together \\nlike a great sluggish river. A leaden band of mist gathered in front of the \\nUrgals and thickened into an intimidating wall, dark as a thunderhead. The \\nUrgals hesitated before it, then continued forward like an unstoppable \\nbattering ram. The barrier swirled around them, concealing the lead ranks from \\nview.\\nThe drain on \\nEragon’s strength was sudden and massive, making his heart flutter like a dying \\nbird. He gasped, eyes rolling. He struggled to sever the magic’s hold on him—to \\nplug the breach through which his life streamed. With a savage growl he jerked \\naway from the magic and broke contact. Tendrils of magic snapped through his \\nmind like decapitated snakes, then reluctantly retreated from his \\nconsciousness, clutching at the dregs of his strength. The wall of mist \\ndissipated, and the fog sluggishly collapsed across the ground like a tower of \\nmud sliding apart. The Urgals had not been hindered at all.\\nEragon lay \\nlimply on Saphira, panting. Only now did he remember Brom saying, “Magic is \\naffected by distance, just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move \\nsomething a mile away, it’ll take more energy than if you were closer.”I \\nwon’t forget that again, he thought grimly.\\nYou shouldn’t \\nhave forgotten in the first place,Saphira inserted pointedly.First the \\ndirt at Gil’ead and now this. Weren’t you paying attention to anything Brom \\ntold you? You’ll kill yourself if you keep this up.\\nI paid \\nattention,he \\ninsisted, rubbing his chin. It’s just been a while, and I haven’t had an \\nopportunity to think back on it. I’ve never used magic at a distance, so how \\ncould I know it would be so difficult?\\nShe growled.Next \\nthing I know you’ll be trying to bring corpses back to life. Don’t forget what \\nBrom said about that, too.\\nI won’t,he said \\nimpatiently. Saphira dipped toward the ground, searching for Murtagh and the \\nhorses. Eragon would have helped her, but he barely had the energy to sit up.\\nSaphira settled \\nin a small field with a jolt, and Eragon was puzzled to see the horses stopped \\nand Murtagh kneeling, examining the ground. When Eragon did not dismount, \\nMurtagh hurried over and inquired, “What’s wrong?” He sounded angry, worried, \\nand tired at the same time.\\n“. . . I made a \\nmistake,” said Eragon truthfully. “The Urgals have entered the valley. I tried \\nto confuse them, but I forgot one of the rules of magic, and it cost me a great \\ndeal.”\\nScowling, \\nMurtagh jerked his thumb over his shoulder. “I just found some wolf tracks, but \\nthe footprints are as wide as both of my hands and an inch deep. There are \\nanimals around here that could be dangerous even to you, Saphira.” He turned to \\nher. “I know you can’t enter the forest, but could you circle above me and the \\nhorses? That should keep these beasts away. Otherwise there may only be enough \\nleft of me to roast in a thimble.”\\n“Humor, \\nMurtagh?” asked Eragon, a quick smile coming to his face. His muscles trembled, \\nmaking it hard for him to concentrate.\\n“Only on the \\ngallows.” Murtagh rubbed his eyes. “I can’t believe that the same Urgals have \\nbeen following us the whole time. They would have to be birds to catch up with \\nus.”\\n“Saphira said \\nthey’re larger than any we’ve seen,” remarked Eragon.\\nMurtagh cursed, \\nclenching the pommel of his sword. “That explains it! Saphira, if you’re right, \\nthen those are Kull, elite of the Urgals. I should have guessed that the \\nchieftain had been put in charge of them. They don’t ride because horses can’t \\ncarry their weight—not one of them is under eight feet tall—and they can run \\nfor days without sleep and still be ready for battle. It can take five men to \\nkill one. Kull never leave their caves except for war, so they must expect a \\ngreat slaughter if they are out in such force.”\\n“Can we stay \\nahead of them?”\\n“Who knows?” \\nsaid Murtagh. “They’re strong, determined, and large in numbers. It’s possible \\nthat we may have to face them. If that happens, I only hope that the Varden \\nhave men posted nearby who’ll help us. Despite our skill and Saphira, we can’t \\nhold off Kull.”\\nEragon swayed. \\n“Could you get me some bread? I need to eat.” Murtagh quickly brought him part \\nof a loaf. It was old and hard, but Eragon chewed on it gratefully. Murtagh \\nscanned the valley walls, worry in his eyes. Eragon knew he was searching for a \\nway out. “There’ll be one farther in.”\\n“Of course,” said \\nMurtagh with forced optimism, then slapped his thigh. “We must go.”\\n“How is Arya?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “The fever’s worse. She’s been tossing and turning. What do you \\nexpect? Her strength is failing. You should fly her to the Varden before the \\npoison does any more damage.”\\n“I won’t leave \\nyou behind,” insisted Eragon, gaining strength with each bite. “Not with the \\nUrgals so near.”\\nMurtagh shrugged \\nagain. “As you wish. But I’m warning you, she won’t live if you stay with me.”\\n“Don’t say \\nthat,” insisted Eragon, pushing himself upright in Saphira’s saddle. “Help me \\nsave her. We can still do it. Consider it a life for a life—atonement for \\nTorkenbrand’s death.”\\nMurtagh’s face \\ndarkened instantly. “It’s not a debt owed. You—” He stopped as a horn echoed \\nthrough the dark forest. “I’ll have more to say to you later,” he said shortly, \\nstomping to the horses. He grabbed their reins and trotted away, shooting an \\nangry glare at Eragon.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes as Saphira took flight. He wished that he could lie on a soft bed and \\nforget all their troubles. Saphira,he said at last, cupping his ears to \\nwarm them, what if we did take Arya to the Varden? Once she was safe, we \\ncould fly back to Murtagh and help him out of here.\\nThe Varden \\nwouldn’t let you,said \\nSaphira.For all they know, you might be returning to inform the Urgals of \\ntheir hiding place. We aren’t arriving under the best conditions to gain their \\ntrust. They’ll want to know why we’ve brought an entire company of Kull to \\ntheir very gates.\\nWe’ll just have to \\ntell them the truth and hope they believe us,said Eragon.\\nAnd what will we \\ndo if the Kull attack Murtagh? \\nFight them, of \\ncourse! I won’t let him and Arya be captured or killed,said Eragon \\nindignantly.\\nThere was a \\ntouch of sarcasm in her words.How noble. Oh, we would fell many of the \\nUrgals—you with magic and blade, whilst my weapons would be tooth and claw—but \\nit would be futile in the end. They are too numerous. . . . We cannot defeat \\nthem, only be defeated.\\nWhat, then?he demanded.I’ll \\nnot leave Arya or Murtagh to their mercy.\\nSaphira waved \\nher tail, the tip whistling loudly.I’m not asking you to. However, if we \\nattack first, we may gain the advantage.\\nHave you gone \\ncrazy? They’ll . . .Eragon’s \\nvoice trailed off as he thought about it.They won’t be able to do a thing, \\nhe concluded, surprised.\\nExactly,said Saphira.We \\ncan inflict lots of damage from a safe height.\\nLet’s drop rocks \\non them!proposed \\nEragon.That should scatter them.\\nIf their skulls \\naren’t thick enough to protect them.Saphira banked to the right and quickly \\ndescended to the Beartooth River. She grasped a mid-sized boulder with her \\nstrong talons while Eragon scooped up several fist-sized rocks. Laden with the \\nstones, Saphira glided on silent wings until they were over the Urgal host.Now! \\nshe exclaimed, releasing the boulder. There were muffled cracks as the missiles \\nplummeted through the forest top, smashing branches. A second later howls \\nechoed through the valley.\\nEragon smiled \\ntightly as he heard the Urgals scramble for cover.Let’s find more \\nammunition, he suggested, bending low over Saphira. She growled in \\nagreement and returned to the riverbed.\\nIt was hard \\nwork, but they were able to hinder the Urgals’ progress—though it was \\nimpossible to stop them altogether. The Urgals gained ground whenever Saphira \\nwent for stones. Despite that, their efforts allowed Murtagh to stay ahead of \\nthe advancing column.\\nThe valley \\ndarkened as the hours slipped by. Without the sun to provide warmth, the sharp \\nbite of frost crept into the air and the ground mist froze on the trees, \\ncoating them white. Night animals began to creep from their dens to peer from \\nshadowed hideouts at the strangers trespassing on their land.\\nEragon continued \\nto examine the mountainsides, searching for the waterfall that would signify \\nthe end of their journey. He was painfully aware that every passing minute \\nbrought Arya closer to death. “Faster, faster,” he muttered to himself, looking \\ndown at Murtagh. Before Saphira scooped up more rocks, he said,Let’s take a \\nrespite and check on Arya. The day is almost over, and I’m afraid her life is \\nmeasured in hours, if not minutes.\\nArya’s life is \\nin Fate’s hands now. You made your choice to stay with Murtagh; it’s too late \\nto change that, so stop agonizing over it. . . . You’re making my scales itch. \\nThe best thing we can do right now is to keep bombarding the Urgals.Eragon knew she \\nwas right, yet her words did nothing to calm his anxiety. He resumed his search \\nfor the waterfall, but whatever lay before them was hidden by a thick mountain \\nridge.\\nTrue darkness \\nbegan to fill the valley, settling over the trees and mountains like an inky \\ncloud. Even with her keen hearing and delicate sense of smell, Saphira could no \\nlonger locate the Urgals through the dense forest. There was no moon to help \\nthem; it would be hours before it rose above the mountains.\\nSaphira made a \\nlong, gentle left turn and glided around the mountain ridge. Eragon vaguely \\nsensed it pass by them, then squinted as he saw a faint white line ahead.Could \\nthat be the waterfall? he wondered.\\nHe looked at the \\nsky, which still held the afterglow of sunset. The mountains’ dark silhouettes \\ncurved together and formed a rough bowl that closed off the valley.The head \\nof the valley isn’t much farther! he exclaimed, pointing at the mountains.Do \\nyou think that the Varden know we’re coming? Maybe they’ll send men out to help \\nus.\\nI doubt they’ll \\nassist us until they know if we are friend or foe,Saphira said as \\nshe abruptly dropped toward the ground.I’m returning to Murtagh—we should \\nstay with him now. Since I can’t find the Urgals, they could sneak up on him \\nwithout us knowing.\\nEragon loosened \\nZar’roc in its sheath, wondering if he was strong enough to fight. Saphira \\nlanded to the left of the Beartooth River, then crouched expectantly. The \\nwaterfall rumbled in the distance.He comes, she said. Eragon strained \\nhis ears and caught the sound of pounding hooves. Murtagh ran out of the \\nforest, driving the horses before him. He saw them but did not slow.\\nEragon jumped \\noff Saphira, stumbling a bit as he matched Murtagh’s pace. Behind him Saphira \\nwent to the river so she could follow them without being hindered by the trees. \\nBefore Eragon could relay his news, Murtagh said, “I saw you dropping rocks \\nwith Saphira—ambitious. Have the Kull stopped or turned back?”\\n“They’re still \\nbehind us, but we’re almost to the head of the valley. How’s Arya?”\\n“She hasn’t \\ndied,” Murtagh said harshly. His breath came in short bursts. His next words \\nwere deceptively calm, like those of a man concealing a terrible passion. “Is there \\na valley or gorge ahead that I can leave through?”\\nApprehensive, \\nEragon tried to remember if he had seen any breaks in the mountains around \\nthem; he had not thought about Murtagh’s dilemma for a while. “It’s dark,” he \\nbegan evasively, dodging a low branch, “so I might have missed something, but . \\n. . no.”\\nMurtagh swore \\nexplosively and came to an abrupt stop, dragging on the horses’ reins until \\nthey halted as well. “Are you saying that the only place I can go is to the \\nVarden?”\\n“Yes, but keep \\nrunning. The Urgals are almost upon us!”\\n“No!” said \\nMurtagh angrily. He stabbed a finger at Eragon. “I warned you that I wouldn’t \\ngo to the Varden, but you went ahead and trapped me between a hammer and an \\nanvil! You’re the one with the elf’s memories. Why didn’t you tell me this was \\na dead end?”\\nEragon bristled \\nat the barrage and retorted, “All I knew was where we had to go, not what lay \\nin between. Don’t blame me for choosing to come.”\\nMurtagh’s breath \\nhissed between his teeth as he furiously spun away. All Eragon could see of him \\nwas a motionless, bowed figure. His own shoulders were tense, and a vein \\nthrobbed on the side of his neck. He put his hands on his hips, impatience \\nrising.\\nWhy have you \\nstopped?asked \\nSaphira, alarmed.\\nDon’t distract \\nme.“What’s \\nyour quarrel with the Varden? It can’t be so terrible that you must keep it \\nhidden even now. Would you rather fight the Kull than reveal it? How many times \\nwill we go through this before you trust me?”\\nThere was a long \\nsilence.\\nThe Urgals!reminded Saphira \\nurgently.\\nI know,said Eragon, \\npushing back his temper.But we have to resolve this.\\nQuickly, \\nquickly.\\n\\n“Murtagh,” said \\nEragon earnestly, “unless you wish to die, we must go to the Varden. Don’t let \\nme walk into their arms without knowing how they will react to you. It’s going \\nto be dangerous enough without unnecessary surprises.”\\nFinally Murtagh \\nturned to Eragon. His breathing was hard and fast, like that of a cornered \\nwolf. He paused, then said with a tortured voice, “You have a right to know. I \\n. . . I am the son of Morzan, first and last of the Forsworn.”\\nT HEHORNS OFADILEMMA\\nEragon was \\nspeechless. Disbelief roared through his mind as he tried to reject Murtagh’s \\nwords.The Forsworn never had any children, least of all Morzan. Morzan! The \\nman who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix and remained the king’s favorite \\nservant for the rest of his life. Could it be true?\\nSaphira’s own \\nshock reached him a second later. She crashed through trees and brush as she \\nbarreled from the river to his side, fangs bared, tail raised threateningly.Be \\nready for anything, she warned.He may be able to use magic.\\n“You are his \\nheir?” asked Eragon, surreptitiously reaching for Zar’roc.What could he want \\nwith me? Is he really working for the king?\\n“I didn’t choose \\nthis!” cried Murtagh, anguish twisting his face. He ripped at his clothes with \\na desperate air, tearing off his tunic and shirt to bare his torso. “Look!” he \\npleaded, and turned his back to Eragon.\\nUnsure, Eragon \\nleaned forward, straining his eyes in the darkness. There, against Murtagh’s \\ntanned and muscled skin, was a knotted white scar that stretched from his right \\nshoulder to his left hip—a testament to some terrible agony.\\n“See that?” \\ndemanded Murtagh bitterly. He talked quickly now, as if relieved to have his secret \\nfinally revealed. “I was only three when I got it. During one of his many \\ndrunken rages, Morzan threw his sword at me as I ran by. My back was laid open \\nby the very sword you now carry—the only thing I expected to receive as \\ninheritance, until Brom stole it from my father’s corpse. I was lucky, I \\nsuppose—there was a healer nearby who kept me from dying. You must understand, \\nI don’t love the Empire or the king. I have no allegiance to them, nor do I \\nmean you harm!” His pleas were almost frantic.\\nEragon uneasily \\nlifted his hand from Zar’roc’s pommel. “Then your father,” he said in a \\nfaltering voice, “was killed by . . .”\\n“Yes, Brom,” \\nsaid Murtagh. He pulled his tunic back on with a detached air.\\nA horn rang out \\nbehind them, prompting Eragon to cry, “Come, run with me.” Murtagh shook the \\nhorses’ reins and forced them into a tired trot, eyes fixed straight ahead, \\nwhile Arya bounced limply in Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira stayed by Eragon’s \\nside, easily keeping pace with her long legs.You could walk unhindered in \\nthe riverbed, he said as she was forced to smash through a dense web of \\nbranches.\\nI’ll not leave \\nyou with him.\\n\\nEragon was glad \\nfor her protection.Morzan’s son! He said between strides, “Your tale is \\nhard to believe. How do I know you aren’t lying?”\\n“Why would I \\nlie?”\\n“You could be—”\\nMurtagh \\ninterrupted him quickly. “I can’t prove anything to you now. Keep your doubts \\nuntil we reach the Varden. They’ll recognize me quickly enough.”\\n“I must know,” \\npressed Eragon. “Do you serve the Empire?”\\n“No. And if I did, \\nwhat would I accomplish by traveling with you? If I were trying to capture or \\nkill you, I would have left you in prison.” Murtagh stumbled as he jumped over \\na fallen log.\\n“You could be \\nleading the Urgals to the Varden.”\\n“Then,” said \\nMurtagh shortly, “why am I still with you? I know where the Varden are now. \\nWhat reason could I have for delivering myself to them? If I were going to \\nattack them, I’d turn around and join the Urgals.”\\n“Maybe you’re an \\nassassin,” stated Eragon flatly.\\n“Maybe. You \\ncan’t really know, can you?”\\nSaphira?Eragon asked \\nsimply.\\nHer tail swished \\nover his head.If he wanted to harm you, he could have done it long ago.\\nA branch whipped \\nEragon’s neck, causing a line of blood to appear on his skin. The waterfall was \\ngrowing louder.I want you to watch Murtagh closely when we get to the \\nVarden. He may do something foolish, and I don’t want him killed by accident.\\nI’ll do my best,she said as she \\nshouldered her way between two trees, scraping off slabs of bark. The horn \\nsounded behind them again. Eragon glanced over his shoulder, expecting Urgals \\nto rush out of the darkness. The waterfall throbbed dully ahead of them, \\ndrowning out the sounds of the night.\\nThe forest \\nended, and Murtagh pulled the horses to a stop. They were on a pebble beach directly \\nto the left of the mouth of the Beartooth River. The deep lake Kóstha-mérna \\nfilled the valley, blocking their way. The water gleamed with flickering \\nstarlight. The mountain walls restricted passage around Kóstha-mérna to a thin \\nstrip of shore on either side of the lake, both no more than a few steps wide. \\nAt the lake’s far end, a broad sheet of water tumbled down a black cliff into \\nboiling mounds of froth.\\n“Do we go to the \\nfalls?” asked Murtagh tightly.\\n“Yes.” Eragon \\ntook the lead and picked his way along the lake’s left side. The pebbles \\nunderfoot were damp and slime covered. There was barely enough room for Saphira \\nbetween the sheer valley wall and the lake; she had to walk with two feet in \\nthe water.\\nThey were \\nhalfway to the waterfall when Murtagh warned, “Urgals!”\\nEragon whirled \\naround, rocks spraying from under his heel. By the shore of Kóstha-mérna, where \\nthey had been only minutes before, hulking figures streamed out of the forest. \\nThe Urgals massed before the lake. One of them gestured at Saphira; guttural \\nwords drifted over the water. Immediately the horde split and started around \\nboth sides of the lake, leaving Eragon and Murtagh without an escape route. The \\nnarrow shore forced the bulky Kull to march single file.\\n“Run!” barked \\nMurtagh, drawing his sword and slapping the horses on their flanks. Saphira \\ntook off without warning and wheeled back toward the Urgals.\\n“No!” cried \\nEragon, shouting with his mind,Come back! but she continued, heedless to \\nhis pleas. With an agonizing effort, he tore his gaze from her and plunged \\nforward, wrenching Zar’roc from its sheath.\\nSaphira dived at \\nthe Urgals, bellowing fiercely. They tried to scatter but were trapped against \\nthe mountainside. She caught a Kull between her talons and carried the \\nscreaming creature aloft, tearing at him with her fangs. The silent body \\ncrashed into the lake a moment later, an arm and a leg missing.\\nThe Kull \\ncontinued around Kóstha-mérna undeterred. With smoke streaming from her \\nnostrils, Saphira dived at them again. She twisted and rolled as a cloud of \\nblack arrows shot toward her. Most of the darts glanced off her scaled sides, \\nleaving no more than bruises, but she roared as the rest pierced her wings.\\nEragon’s arms \\ntwinged with sympathetic pain, and he had to restrain himself from rushing to \\nher defense. Fear flooded his veins as he saw the line of Urgals closing in on \\nthem. He tried to run faster, but his muscles were too tired, the rocks too \\nslippery.\\nThen, with a \\nloud splash, Saphira plunged into Kóstha-mérna. She submerged completely, \\nsending ripples across the lake. The Urgals nervously eyed the dark water \\nlapping their feet. One growled something indecipherable and jabbed his spear \\nat the lake.\\nThe water \\nexploded as Saphira’s head shot out of the depths. Her jaws closed on the \\nspear, breaking it like a twig as she tore it out of the Kull’s hands with a \\nvicious twist. Before she could seize the Urgal himself, his companions thrust \\nat her with their spears, bloodying her nose.\\nSaphira jerked \\nback and hissed angrily, beating the water with her tail. Keeping his spear \\npointed at her, the lead Kull tried to edge past, but halted when she snapped \\nat his legs. The string of Urgals was forced to stop as she held him at bay. \\nMeanwhile, the Kull on the other side of the lake still hurried toward the \\nfalls.\\nI’ve trapped \\nthem,she \\ntold Eragon tersely,but hurry—I cannot hold them long. Archers on the \\nshore were already taking aim at her. Eragon concentrated on going faster, but \\na rock gave under his boot and he pitched forward. Murtagh’s strong arm kept \\nhim on his feet, and clasping each other’s forearms, they urged the horses \\nforward with shouts.\\nThey were almost \\nto the waterfall. The noise was overwhelming, like an avalanche. A white wall \\nof water gushed down the cliff, pounding the rocks below with a fury that sent \\nmist spraying through the air to run down their faces. Four yards from the \\nthunderous curtain, the beach widened, giving them room to maneuver.\\nSaphira roared \\nas an Urgal spear grazed her haunch, then retreated underwater. With her \\nwithdrawal the Kull rushed forward with long strides. They were only a few \\nhundred feet away. “What do we do now?” Murtagh demanded coldly.\\n“I don’t know. \\nLet me think!” cried Eragon, searching Arya’s memories for her final \\ninstructions. He scanned the ground until he found a rock the size of an apple, \\ngrabbed it, then pounded on the cliff next to the falls, shouting, “Aí varden \\nabr du Shur’tugals gata vanta!”\\nNothing \\nhappened.\\nHe tried again, \\nshouting louder than before, but only succeeded in bruising his hand. He turned \\nin despair to Murtagh. “We’re trap—” His words were cut off as Saphira leapt \\nout of the lake, dousing them with icy water. She landed on the beach and \\ncrouched, ready to fight.\\nThe horses \\nbackpedaled wildly, trying to bolt. Eragon reached out with his mind to steady \\nthem.Behind you! cried Saphira. He turned and glimpsed the lead Urgal \\nrunning at him, heavy spear raised. Up close a Kull was as tall as a small \\ngiant, with legs and arms as thick as tree trunks.\\nMurtagh drew back \\nhis arm and threw his sword with incredible speed. The long weapon revolved \\nonce, then struck the Kull point first in the chest with a dull crunch. The \\nhuge Urgal toppled to the ground with a strangled gurgle. Before another Kull \\ncould attack, Murtagh dashed forward and yanked his sword out of the body.\\nEragon raised \\nhis palm, shouting, “Jierda theirra kalfis!” Sharp cracks resounded off the \\ncliff. Twenty of the charging Urgals fell into Kóstha-mérna, howling and \\nclutching their legs where shards of bone protruded. Without breaking stride, \\nthe rest of the Urgals advanced over their fallen companions. Eragon struggled \\nagainst his weariness, putting a hand on Saphira for support.\\nA flight of \\narrows, impossible to see in the darkness, brushed past them and clattered \\nagainst the cliff. Eragon and Murtagh ducked, covering their heads. With a \\nsmall growl, Saphira jumped over them so that her armored sides shielded them \\nand the horses. A chorus of clinks sounded as a second volley of arrows bounced \\noff her scales.\\n“What now?” \\nshouted Murtagh. There was still no opening in the cliff. “We can’t stay here!”\\nEragon heard \\nSaphira snarl as an arrow caught the edge of her wing, tearing the thin \\nmembrane. He looked around wildly, trying to understand why Arya’s instructions \\nhad not worked. “I don’t know! This is where we’re supposed to be!”\\n“Why don’t you \\nask the elf to make sure?” demanded Murtagh. He dropped his sword, snatched his \\nbow from Tornac’s saddlebags, and with a swift motion loosed an arrow from \\nbetween the spikes on Saphira’s back. A moment later an Urgal toppled into the \\nwater.\\n“Now? She’s \\nbarely alive! How’s she going to find the energy to say anything?”\\n“I don’tknow, \\n” shouted Murtagh, “but you’d better think ofsomething because we can’t \\nstave off an entire army!”\\nEragon,growled Saphira \\nurgently.\\nWhat! \\nWe’re on the \\nwrong side of the lake! I’ve seen Arya’s memories through you, and I just \\nrealized that this isn’t the right place.She tucked her head against her \\nbreast as another flight of arrows sped toward them. Her tail flicked in pain \\nas they struck her.I can’t keep this up! They’re tearing me to pieces!\\nEragon slammed \\nZar’roc back into its sheath and exclaimed, “The Varden are on the other side \\nof the lake. We have to go through the waterfall!” He noted with dread that the \\nUrgals across Kóstha-mérna were almost to the falls.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nshot toward the violent deluge blocking their way. “We’ll never get the horses \\nthrough there, even if we can hold our own footing.”\\n“I’ll convince \\nthem to follow us,” snapped Eragon. “And Saphira can carry Arya.” The Urgals’ \\ncries and bellows made Snowfire snort angrily. The elf lolled on his back, \\noblivious to the danger.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “It’s better than being hacked to death.” He swiftly cut Arya loose \\nfrom Snowfire’s saddle, and Eragon caught the elf as she slid to the ground.\\nI’m ready,said Saphira, \\nrising into a half-crouch. The approaching Urgals hesitated, unsure of her \\nintentions.\\n“Now!” cried \\nEragon. He and Murtagh heaved Arya onto Saphira, then secured her legs in the \\nsaddle’s straps. The second they were finished, Saphira swept up her wings and \\nsoared over the lake. The Urgals behind her howled as they saw her escaping. \\nArrows clattered off her belly. The Kull on the other shore redoubled their \\npace so as to attain the waterfall before she landed.\\nEragon reached \\nout with his mind to force himself into the frightened thoughts of the horses. \\nUsing the ancient language, he told them that unless they swam through the \\nwaterfall, they would be killed and eaten by the Urgals. Though they did not \\nunderstand everything he said, the meaning of his words was unmistakable.\\nSnowfire and \\nTornac tossed their heads, then dashed into the thundering downpour, whinnying \\nas it struck their backs. They floundered, struggling to stay above water. \\nMurtagh sheathed his sword and jumped after them; his head disappeared under a \\nfroth of bubbles before he bobbed up, sputtering.\\nThe Urgals were \\nright behind Eragon; he could hear their feet crunching on the gravel. With a \\nfierce war cry he leapt after Murtagh, closing his eyes a second before the \\ncold water pummeled him.\\nThe tremendous \\nweight of the waterfall slammed down on his shoulders with backbreaking force. \\nThe water’s mindless roar filled his ears. He was driven to the bottom, where \\nhis knees gouged the rocky lakebed. He kicked off with all his strength and \\nshot partway out of the water. Before he could take a gulp of air, the cascade \\nrammed him back underwater.\\nAll he could see \\nwas a white blur as foam billowed around him. He frantically tried to surface \\nand relieve his burning lungs, but he only rose a few feet before the deluge \\nhalted his ascent. He panicked, thrashing his arms and legs, fighting the \\nwater. Weighed down by Zar’roc and his drenched clothes, he sank back to the \\nlakebed, unable to speak the ancient words that could save him.\\nSuddenly a \\nstrong hand grasped the back of his tunic and dragged him through the water. \\nHis rescuer sliced through the lake with quick, short strokes; Eragon hoped it \\nwas Murtagh, not an Urgal. They surfaced and stumbled onto the pebble beach. \\nEragon was trembling violently; his entire body shivered in bursts.\\nSounds of combat \\nerupted to his right, and he whirled toward them, expecting an Urgal attack. \\nThe monsters on the opposite shore—where he had stood only moments before—fell \\nbeneath a withering hail of arrows from crevasses that pockmarked the cliff. \\nScores of Urgals already floated belly up in the water, riddled with shafts. \\nThe ones on Eragon’s shore were similarly engaged. Neither group could retreat \\nfrom their exposed positions, for rows of warriors had somehow appeared behind \\nthem, where the lake met the mountainsides. All that prevented the nearest Kull \\nfrom rushing Eragon was the steady rain of arrows—the unseen archers seemed \\ndetermined to keep the Urgals at bay.\\nA gruff voice \\nnext to Eragon said, “Akh Guntéraz dorzâda! What were they thinking? You would \\nhave drowned!” Eragon jerked with surprise. It was not Murtagh standing by him \\nbut a diminutive man no taller than his elbow.\\nThe dwarf was \\nbusy wringing water out of his long braided beard. His chest was stocky, and he \\nwore a chain-mail jacket cut off at the shoulders to reveal muscular arms. A \\nwar ax hung from a wide leather belt strapped around his waist. An iron-bound \\noxhide cap, bearing the symbol of a hammer surrounded by twelve stars, sat \\nfirmly on his head. Even with the cap, he barely topped four feet. He looked \\nlongingly at the fighting and said, “Barzul, but I wish I could join them!”\\nA dwarf!Eragon drew \\nZar’roc and looked for Saphira and Murtagh. Two twelve-foot-thick stone doors \\nhad opened in the cliff, revealing a broad tunnel nearly thirty feet tall that \\nburrowed its way into the mysterious depths of the mountain. A line of \\nflameless lamps filled the passageway with a pale sapphire light that spilled \\nout onto the lake.\\nSaphira and \\nMurtagh stood before the tunnel, surrounded by a grim mixture of men and \\ndwarves. At Murtagh’s elbow was a bald, beardless man dressed in purple and \\ngold robes. He was taller than all the other humans—and he was holding a dagger \\nto Murtagh’s throat.\\nEragon reached \\nfor his power, but the robed man said in a sharp, dangerous voice, “Stop! If \\nyou use magic, I’ll kill your lovely friend here, who was so kind as to mention \\nyou’re a Rider. Don’t think I won’t know if you’re drawing upon it. You can’t \\nhide anything from me.” Eragon tried to speak, but the man snarled and pressed \\nthe dagger harder against Murtagh’s throat. “None of that! If you say or do \\nanything I don’t tell you to, he will die. Now, everyone inside.” He backed \\ninto the tunnel, pulling Murtagh with him and keeping his eyes on Eragon.\\nSaphira, what \\nshould I do?Eragon \\nasked quickly as the men and dwarves followed Murtagh’s captor, leading the \\nhorses along with them.\\nGo with them,she counseled,and \\nhope that we live. She entered the tunnel herself, eliciting nervous \\nglances from those around her. Reluctantly, Eragon followed her, aware that the \\nwarriors’ eyes were upon him. His rescuer, the dwarf, walked alongside him with \\na hand on the haft of his war ax.\\nUtterly \\nexhausted, Eragon staggered into the mountain. The stone doors swung shut \\nbehind them with only a whisper of sound. He looked back and saw a seamless \\nwall where the opening had been. They were trapped inside. But were they any \\nsafer?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nH UNTING FORANSWERS\\n“This way,” \\nsnapped the bald man. He stepped back, keeping the dagger pressed under \\nMurtagh’s chin, then wheeled to the right, disappearing through an arched \\ndoorway. The warriors cautiously followed him, their attention centered on \\nEragon and Saphira. The horses were led into a different tunnel.\\nDazed by the \\nturn of events, Eragon started after Murtagh. He glanced at Saphira to confirm \\nthat Arya was still tied to her back.She has to get the antidote! he \\nthought frantically, knowing that even then the Skilna Bragh was fulfilling its \\ndeadly purpose within her flesh.\\nHe hurried \\nthrough the arched doorway and down a narrow corridor after the bald man. The \\nwarriors kept their weapons pointed at him. They swept past a sculpture of a \\npeculiar animal with thick quills. The corridor curved sharply to the left, \\nthen to the right. A door opened and they entered a bare room large enough for \\nSaphira to move around with ease. There was a hollow boom as the door closed, \\nfollowed by a loud scrape as a bolt was secured on the outside.\\nEragon slowly \\nexamined his surroundings, Zar’roc tight in his hand. The walls, floor, and \\nceiling were made of polished white marble that reflected a ghost image of \\neveryone, like a mirror of veined milk. One of the unusual lanterns hung in \\neach corner. “There’s an injured—” he began, but a sharp gesture from the bald \\nman cut him off.\\n“Do not speak! \\nIt must wait until you have been tested.” He shoved Murtagh over to one of the \\nwarriors, who pressed a sword against Murtagh’s neck. The bald man clasped his \\nhands together softly. “Remove your weapons and slide them to me.” A dwarf \\nunbuckled Murtagh’s sword and dropped it on the floor with a clank.\\nLoath to be \\nparted with Zar’roc, Eragon unfastened the sheath and set it and the blade on \\nthe floor. He placed his bow and quiver next to them, then pushed the pile \\ntoward the warriors. “Now step away from your dragon and slowly approach me,” \\ncommanded the bald man.\\nPuzzled, Eragon \\nmoved forward. When they were a yard apart, the man said, “Stop there! Now \\nremove the defenses from around your mind and prepare to let me inspect your \\nthoughts and memories. If you try to hide anything from me, I will take what I \\nwant by force . . . which would drive you mad. If you don’t submit, your \\ncompanion will be killed.”\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon, aghast.\\n“To be sure you \\naren’t in Galbatorix’s service and to understand why hundreds of Urgals are \\nbanging on our front door,” growled the bald man. His close-set eyes shifted \\nfrom point to point with cunning speed. “No one may enter Farthen Dûr without \\nbeing tested.”\\n“There isn’t \\ntime. We need a healer!” protested Eragon.\\n“Silence!” \\nroared the man, pressing down his robe with thin fingers. “Until you are \\nexamined, your words are meaningless!”\\n“But she’s \\ndying!” retorted Eragon angrily, pointing at Arya. They were in a precarious \\nposition, but he would let nothing else happen until Arya was cared for.\\n“It will have to \\nwait! No one will leave this room until we have discovered the truth of this matter. \\nUnless you wish—”\\nThe dwarf who \\nhad saved Eragon from the lake jumped forward. “Are you blind, Egraz Carn? \\nCan’t you see that’s an elf on the dragon? We cannot keep her here if she’s in \\ndanger. Ajihad and the king will have our heads if she’s allowed to die!”\\nThe man’s eyes \\ntightened with anger. After a moment he relaxed and said smoothly, “Of course, \\nOrik, we wouldn’t want that to happen.” He snapped his fingers and pointed at \\nArya. “Remove her from the dragon.” Two human warriors sheathed their swords \\nand hesitantly approached Saphira, who watched them steadily. “Quickly, \\nquickly!”\\nThe men \\nunstrapped Arya from the saddle and lowered the elf to the floor. One of the \\nmen inspected her face, then said sharply, “It’s the dragon-egg courier, Arya!”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed the bald man. The dwarf Orik’s eyes widened with astonishment. The \\nbald man fixed his steely gaze on Eragon and said flatly, “You have much \\nexplaining to do.”\\nEragon returned \\nthe intense stare with all the determination he could muster. “She was poisoned \\nwith the Skilna Bragh while in prison. Only Túnivor’s Nectar can save her now.”\\nThe bald man’s \\nface became inscrutable. He stood motionless, except for his lips, which \\ntwitched occasionally. “Very well. Take her to the healers, and tell them what \\nshe needs. Guard her until the ceremony is completed. I will have new orders \\nfor you by then.” The warriors nodded curtly and carried Arya out of the room. \\nEragon watched them go, wishing that he could accompany her. His attention \\nsnapped back to the bald man as he said, “Enough of this, we have wasted too \\nmuch time already. Prepare to be examined.”\\nEragon did not \\nwant this hairless threatening man inside his mind, laying bare his every \\nthought and feeling, but he knew that resistance would be useless. The air was \\nstrained. Murtagh’s gaze burned into his forehead. Finally he bowed his head. \\n“I am ready.”\\n“Good, then—”\\nHe was \\ninterrupted as Orik said abruptly, “You’d better not harm him, Egraz Carn, else \\nthe king will have words for you.”\\nThe bald man \\nlooked at him irritably, then faced Eragon with a small smile. “Only if he \\nresists.” He bowed his head and chanted several inaudible words.\\nEragon gasped \\nwith pain and shock as a mental probe clawed its way into his mind. His eyes \\nrolled up into his head, and he automatically began throwing up barriers around \\nhis consciousness. The attack was incredibly powerful.\\nDon’t do that!cried Saphira. \\nHer thoughts joined his, filling him with strength.You’re putting Murtagh at \\nrisk! Eragon faltered, gritted his teeth, then forced himself to remove his \\nshielding, exposing himself to the ravening probe. Disappointment emanated from \\nthe bald man. His battering intensified. The force coming from his mind felt \\ndecayed and unwholesome; there was something profoundly wrong about it.\\nHe wants me to \\nfight him!cried \\nEragon as a fresh wave of pain racked him. A second later it subsided, only to \\nbe replaced by another. Saphira did her best to suppress it, but even she could \\nnot block it entirely.\\nGive him what he \\nwants,she \\nsaid quickly,but protect everything else. I’ll help you. His strength is no \\nmatch for mine; I’m already shielding our words from him.\\nThen why does it \\nstill hurt?\\n\\nThe pain comes \\nfrom you.\\n\\nEragon winced as \\nthe probe dug in farther, hunting for information, like a nail being driven \\nthrough his skull. The bald man roughly seized his childhood memories and began \\nsifting through them.He doesn’t need those—get him out of there! growled \\nEragon angrily.\\nI can’t, not \\nwithout endangering you,said Saphira.I can conceal things from his view, \\nbut it must be done before he reaches them. Think quickly, and tell me what you \\nwant hidden!\\nEragon tried to \\nconcentrate through the pain. He raced through his memories, starting from when \\nhe had found Saphira’s egg. He hid sections of his discussions with Brom, \\nincluding all the ancient words he had been taught. Their travels through \\nPalancar Valley, Yazuac, Daret, and Teirm he left mostly untouched. But he had \\nSaphira conceal everything he remembered of Angela’s fortunetelling and \\nSolembum. He skipped from their burglary at Teirm, to Brom’s death, to his \\nimprisonment in Gil’ead, and lastly to Murtagh’s revelation of his true \\nidentity.\\nEragon wanted to \\nhide that as well, but Saphira balked.The Varden have a right to know who \\nthey shelter under their roof, especially if it’s a son of the Forsworn!\\nJust do it,he said tightly, \\nfighting another wave of agony.I won’t be the one to unmask him, at least \\nnot to this man.\\nIt’ll be \\ndiscovered as soon as Murtagh is scanned,warned Saphira sharply.\\nJust do it. \\nWith the most \\nimportant information hidden, there was nothing else for Eragon to do but wait \\nfor the bald man to finish his inspection. It was like sitting still while his \\nfingernails were extracted with rusty tongs. His entire body was rigid, jaw \\nlocked tightly. Heat radiated from his skin, and a line of sweat rolled down \\nhis neck. He was acutely aware of each second as the long minutes crept by.\\nThe bald man \\nwound through his experiences sluggishly, like a thorny vine pushing its way \\ntoward the sunlight. He paid keen attention to many things Eragon considered \\nirrelevant, such as his mother, Selena, and seemed to linger on purpose so as \\nto prolong the suffering. He spent a long time examining Eragon’s recollections \\nof the Ra’zac, and then later the Shade. It was not until his adventures had \\nbeen exhaustively analyzed that the bald man began to withdraw from Eragon’s \\nmind.\\nThe probe was \\nextracted like a splinter being removed. Eragon shuddered, swayed, then fell \\ntoward the floor. Strong arms caught him at the last second, lowering him to \\nthe cool marble. He heard Orik exclaim from behind him, “You went too far! He \\nwasn’t strong enough for this.”\\n“He’ll live. \\nThat’s all that is needed,” answered the bald man curtly.\\nThere was an \\nangry grunt. “What did you find?”\\nSilence.\\n“Well, is he to \\nbe trusted or not?”\\nThe words came \\nreluctantly. “He . . . is not your enemy.” There were audible sighs of relief \\nthroughout the room.\\nEragon’s eyes \\nfluttered open. He gingerly pushed himself upright. “Easy now,” said Orik, \\nwrapping a thick arm around him and helping him to his feet. Eragon wove \\nunsteadily, glaring at the bald man. A low growl rumbled in Saphira’s throat.\\nThe bald man \\nignored them. He turned to Murtagh, who was still being held at sword point. \\n“It’s your turn now.”\\nMurtagh \\nstiffened and shook his head. The sword cut his neck slightly. Blood dripped \\ndown his skin. “No.”\\n“You will not be \\nprotected here if you refuse.”\\n“Eragon has been \\ndeclared trustworthy, so you cannot threaten to kill him to influence me. Since \\nyou can’t do that, nothing you say or do will convince me to open my mind.”\\nSneering, the \\nbald man cocked what would have been an eyebrow, if he had any. “What of your \\nown life? I can still threaten that.”\\n“It won’t do any \\ngood,” said Murtagh stonily and with such conviction that it was impossible to \\ndoubt his word.\\nThe bald man’s \\nbreath exploded angrily. “You don’t have a choice!” He stepped forward and \\nplaced his palm on Murtagh’s brow, clenching his hand to hold him in place. \\nMurtagh stiffened, face growing as hard as iron, fists clenched, neck muscles \\nbulging. He was obviously fighting the attack with all his strength. The bald \\nman bared his teeth with fury and frustration at the resistance; his fingers \\ndug mercilessly into Murtagh.\\nEragon winced in \\nsympathy, knowing the battle that raged between them.Can’t you help him? \\nhe asked Saphira.\\nNo,she said softly.He \\nwill allow no one into his mind.\\nOrik scowled \\ndarkly as he watched the combatants. “Ilf carnz orodüm,” he muttered, then \\nleapt forward and cried, “That is enough!” He grabbed the bald man’s arm and \\ntore him away from Murtagh with strength disproportional to his size.\\nThe bald man \\nstumbled back, then turned on Orik furiously. “How dare you!” he shouted. “You \\nquestioned my leadership, opened the gates without permission, and now this! \\nYou’ve shown nothing but insolence and treachery. Do you think your king will \\nprotect you now?”\\nOrik bristled. \\n“You would have let them die! If I had waited any longer, the Urgals would have \\nkilled them.” He pointed at Murtagh, whose breath came in great heaves. “We \\ndon’t have any right to torture him for information! Ajihad won’t sanction it. \\nNot after you’ve examined the Rider and found him free of fault.And they’ve \\nbrought us Arya.”\\n“Would you allow \\nhim to enter unchallenged? Are you so great a fool as to put us all at risk?” \\ndemanded the bald man. His eyes were feral with loosely chained rage; he looked \\nready to tear the dwarf into pieces.\\n“Can he use \\nmagic?”\\n“That is—”\\n“Can he use \\nmagic?” roared Orik, his deep voice echoing in the room. The bald man’s face \\nsuddenly grew expressionless. He clasped his hands behind his back.\\n“No.”\\n“Then what do \\nyou fear? It’s impossible for him to escape, and he can’t work any devilry with \\nall of us here, especially if your powers are as great as you say. But don’t \\nlisten to me; ask Ajihad what he wants done.”\\nThe bald man \\nstared at Orik for a moment, his face indecipherable, then looked at the \\nceiling and closed his eyes. A peculiar stiffness set into his shoulders while \\nhis lips moved soundlessly. An intense frown wrinkled the pale skin above his \\neyes, and his fingers clenched, as if they were throttling an invisible enemy. \\nFor several minutes he stood thus, wrapped in silent communication.\\nWhen his eyes \\nopened, he ignored Orik and snapped at the warriors, “Leave, now!” As they \\nfiled through the doorway, he addressed Eragon coldly, “Because I was unable to \\ncomplete my examination, you and . . . your friend will remain here for the \\nnight. He will be killed if he attempts to leave.” With those words he turned \\non his heel and stalked out of the room, pale scalp gleaming in the lantern \\nlight.\\n“Thank you,” \\nwhispered Eragon to Orik.\\nThe dwarf \\ngrunted. “I’ll make sure some food is brought.” He muttered a string of words \\nunder his breath, then left, shaking his head. The bolt was secured once again \\non the outside of the door.\\nEragon sat, \\nfeeling strangely dreamy from the day’s excitement and their forced march. His \\neyelids were heavy. Saphira settled next to him.We must be careful. It seems \\nwe have as many enemies here as we did in the Empire. He nodded, too tired \\nto talk.\\nMurtagh, eyes \\nglazed and empty, leaned against the far wall and slid to the shiny floor. He \\nheld his sleeve against the cut on his neck to stop the bleeding. “Are you all \\nright?” asked Eragon. Murtagh nodded jerkily. “Did he get anything from you?”\\n“No.”\\n“How were you \\nable to keep him out? He’s so strong.”\\n“I’ve . . . I’ve \\nbeen well trained.” There was a bitter note to his voice.\\nSilence \\nenshrouded them. Eragon’s gaze drifted to one of the lanterns hanging in a \\ncorner. His thoughts meandered until he abruptly said, “I didn’t let them know \\nwho you are.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nrelieved. He bowed his head. “Thank you for not betraying me.”\\n“They didn’t \\nrecognize you.”\\n“No.”\\n“And you still \\nsay that you are Morzan’s son?”\\n“Yes,” he \\nsighed.\\nEragon started \\nto speak, but stopped when he felt hot liquid splash onto his hand. He looked \\ndown and was startled to see a drop of dark blood roll off his skin. It had \\nfallen from Saphira’s wing.I forgot. You’re injured! he exclaimed, \\ngetting up with an effort.I’d better heal you.\\nBe careful. It’s \\neasy to make mistakes when you’re this tired. \\nI know.Saphira unfolded \\none of her wings and lowered it to the floor. Murtagh watched as Eragon ran his \\nhands over the warm blue membrane, saying, “Waíse heill,” whenever he found an \\narrow hole. Luckily, all the wounds were relatively easy to heal, even those on \\nher nose.\\nTask completed, \\nEragon slumped against Saphira, breathing hard. He could feel her great heart \\nbeating with the steady throb of life. “I hope they bring food soon,” said \\nMurtagh.\\nEragon shrugged; \\nhe was too exhausted to be hungry. He crossed his arms, missing Zar’roc’s \\nweight by his side. “Why are you here?”\\n“What?”\\n“If you really \\nare Morzan’s son, Galbatorix wouldn’t let you wander around Alagaësia freely. \\nHow is it that you managed to find the Ra’zac by yourself? Why is it I’ve never \\nheard of any of the Forsworn having children? And what are you doing here?” His \\nvoice rose to a near shout at the end.\\nMurtagh ran his \\nhands over his face. “It’s a long story.”\\n“We’re not going \\nanywhere,” rebutted Eragon.\\n“It’s too late \\nto talk.”\\n“There probably \\nwon’t be time for it tomorrow.”\\nMurtagh wrapped \\nhis arms around his legs and rested his chin on his knees, rocking back and \\nforth as he stared at the floor. “It’s not a—” he said, then interrupted \\nhimself. “I don’t want to stop . . . so make yourself comfortable. My story \\nwill take a while.” Eragon shifted against Saphira’s side and nodded. Saphira \\nwatched both of them intently.\\nMurtagh’s first \\nsentence was halting, but his voice gained strength and confidence as he spoke. \\n“As far as I know . . . I am the only child of the Thirteen Servants, or the \\nForsworn as they’re called. There may be others, for the Thirteen had the skill \\nto hide whatever they wanted, but I doubt it, for reasons I’ll explain later.\\n“My parents met \\nin a small village—I never learned where—while my father was traveling on the \\nking’s business. Morzan showed my mother some small kindness, no doubt a ploy \\nto gain her confidence, and when he left, she accompanied him. They traveled \\ntogether for a time, and as is the nature of these things, she fell deeply in \\nlove with him. Morzan was delighted to discover this not only because it gave \\nhim numerous opportunities to torment her but also because he recognized the \\nadvantage of having a servant who wouldn’t betray him.\\n“Thus, when \\nMorzan returned to Galbatorix’s court, my mother became the tool he relied upon \\nmost. He used her to carry his secret messages, and he taught her rudimentary \\nmagic, which helped her remain undiscovered and, on occasion, extract \\ninformation from people. He did his best to protect her from the rest of the \\nThirteen—not out of any feelings for her, but because they would have used her \\nagainst him, given the chance. . . . For three years things proceeded in this \\nmanner, until my mother became pregnant.”\\nMurtagh paused \\nfor a moment, fingering a lock of his hair. He continued in a clipped tone, “My \\nfather was, if nothing else, a cunning man. He knew that the pregnancy put both \\nhim and my mother in danger, not to mention the baby—that is, me. So, in the \\ndead of night, he spirited her away from the palace and took her to his castle. \\nOnce there, he laid down powerful spells that prevented anyone from entering \\nhis estate except for a few chosen servants. In this way the pregnancy was kept \\nsecret from everyone but Galbatorix.\\n“Galbatorix knew \\nthe intimate details of the Thirteen’s lives: their plots, their fights—and \\nmost importantly—their thoughts. He enjoyed watching them battle each other and \\noften helped one or the other for his own amusement. But for some reason he \\nnever revealed my existence.\\n“I was born in \\ndue time and given to a wet nurse so my mother could return to Morzan’s side. \\nShe had no choice in the matter. Morzan allowed her to visit me every few \\nmonths, but otherwise we were kept apart. Another three years passed like this, \\nduring which time he gave me the . . . scar on my back.” Murtagh brooded a \\nminute before continuing.\\n“I would have \\ngrown to manhood in this fashion if Morzan hadn’t been summoned away to hunt \\nfor Saphira’s egg. As soon as he departed, my mother, who had been left behind, \\nvanished. No one knows where she went, or why. The king tried to hunt her down, \\nbut his men couldn’t find her trail—no doubt because of Morzan’s training.\\n“At the time of \\nmy birth, only five of the Thirteen were still alive. By the time Morzan left, \\nthat number had been reduced to three; when he finally faced Brom in Gil’ead, \\nhe was the only one remaining. The Forsworn died through various means: \\nsuicide, ambush, overuse of magic . . . but it was mostly the work of the Varden. \\nI’m told that the king was in a terrible rage because of those losses.\\n“However, before \\nword of Morzan’s and the others’ deaths reached us, my mother returned. Many \\nmonths had passed since she had disappeared. Her health was poor, as if she had \\nsuffered a great illness, and she grew steadily worse. Within a fortnight, she \\ndied.”\\n“What happened \\nthen?” prompted Eragon.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “I grew up. The king brought me to the palace and arranged for my \\nupbringing. Aside from that, he left me alone.”\\n“Then why did \\nyou leave?”\\nA hard laugh \\nbroke from Murtagh. “Escaped is more like it. At my last birthday, when I \\nturned eighteen, the king summoned me to his quarters for a private dinner. The \\nmessage surprised me because I had always distanced myself from the court and \\nhad rarely met him. We’d talked before, but always within earshot of \\neavesdropping nobles.\\n“I accepted the \\noffer, of course, aware that it would be unwise to refuse. The meal was \\nsumptuous, but throughout it his black eyes never left me. His gaze was \\ndisconcerting; it seemed that he was searching for something hidden in my face. \\nI didn’t know what to make of it and did my best to provide polite \\nconversation, but he refused to talk, and I soon ceased my efforts.\\n“When the meal \\nwas finished, he finally began to speak. You’ve never heard his voice, so it’s \\nhard for me to make you understand what it was like. His words were entrancing, \\nlike a snake whispering gilded lies into my ears. A more convincing and \\nfrightening man I’ve never heard. He wove a vision: a fantasy of the Empire as \\nhe imagined it. There would be beautiful cities built across the country, \\nfilled with the greatest warriors, artisans, musicians, and philosophers. The \\nUrgals would finally be eradicated. And the Empire would expand in every \\ndirection until it reached the four corners of Alagaësia. Peace and prosperity \\nwould flourish, but more wondrous yet, the Riders would be brought back to \\ngently govern over Galbatorix’s fiefdoms.\\n“Entranced, I \\nlistened to him for what must have been hours. When he stopped, I eagerly asked \\nhow the Riders would be reinstated, for everyone knew there were no dragon eggs \\nleft. Galbatorix grew still then and stared at me thoughtfully. For a long time \\nhe was silent, but then he extended his hand and asked, ‘Will you, O son of my \\nfriend, serve me as I labor to bring about this paradise?’\\n“Though I knew \\nthe history behind his and my father’s rise to power, the dream he had painted \\nfor me was too compelling, too seductive to ignore. Ardor for this mission \\nfilled me, and I fervently pledged myself to him. Obviously pleased, Galbatorix \\ngave me his blessing, then dismissed me, saying, ‘I shall call upon you when \\nthe need arises.’\\n“Several months \\npassed before he did. When the summons came, I felt all of my old excitement \\nreturn. We met in private as before, but this time he was not pleasant or \\ncharming. The Varden had just destroyed three brigades in the south, and his \\nwrath was out in full force. He charged me in a terrible voice to take a \\ndetachment of troops and destroy Cantos, where rebels were known to hide \\noccasionally. When I asked what we should do with the people there and how we \\nwould know if they were guilty, he shouted, ‘They’re all traitors! Burn them at \\nthe stake and bury their ashes with dung!’ He continued to rant, cursing his \\nenemies and describing how he would scourge the land of everyone who bore him \\nill will.\\n“His tone was so \\ndifferent from what I had encountered before; it made me realize he didn’t \\npossess the mercy or foresight to gain the people’s loyalty, and he ruled only \\nthrough brute force guided by his own passions. It was at that moment I \\ndetermined to escape him and Urû’baen forever.\\n“As soon as I \\nwas free of his presence, I and my faithful servant, Tornac, made ready for \\nflight. We left that very night, but somehow Galbatorix anticipated my actions, \\nfor there were soldiers waiting for us outside the gates. Ah, my sword was \\nbloody, flashing in the dim lantern glow. We defeated the men . . . but in the \\nprocess Tornac was killed.\\n“Alone and \\nfilled with grief, I fled to an old friend who sheltered me in his estate. \\nWhile I hid, I listened carefully to every rumor, trying to predict \\nGalbatorix’s actions and plan my future. During that time, talk reached me that \\nthe Ra’zac had been sent to capture or kill someone. Remembering the king’s \\nplans for the Riders, I decided to find and follow the Ra’zac, just in case \\ntheydid discover a dragon. And that’s how I found you. . . . I have no \\nmore secrets.”\\nWe still don’t \\nknow if he’s telling the truth,warned Saphira.\\nI know,said Eragon,but \\nwhy would he lie to us?\\nHe might be mad. \\nI doubt it.Eragon ran a \\nfinger over Saphira’s hard scales, watching the light reflect off them. “So why \\ndon’t you join the Varden? They’ll distrust you for a time, but once you prove \\nyour loyalty they’ll treat you with respect. And aren’t they in a sense your \\nallies? They strive to end the king’s reign. Isn’t that what you want?”\\n“Must I spell \\neverything out for you?” demanded Murtagh. “I don’t want Galbatorix to learn \\nwhere I am, which is inevitable if people start saying that I’ve sided with his \\nenemies, which I’ve never done. These,” he paused, then said with distaste, “rebelsare \\ntrying not only to overthrow the king but to destroy the Empire . . . and I \\ndon’t want that to happen. It would sow mayhem and anarchy. The king is flawed, \\nyes, but the system itself is sound. As for earning the Varden’s respect: Ha! \\nOnce I am exposed, they’ll treat me like a criminal or worse. Not only that, \\nsuspicion will fall upon you because we traveled together!”\\nHe’s right,said Saphira.\\nEragon ignored \\nher. “It isn’t that bad,” he said, trying to sound optimistic. Murtagh snorted \\nderisively and looked away. “I’m sure that they won’t be—” His words were cut \\nshort as the door opened a hand’s breadth and two bowls were pushed through the \\nspace. A loaf of bread and a hunk of raw meat followed, then the door was shut \\nagain.\\n“Finally!” \\ngrumbled Murtagh, going to the food. He tossed the meat to Saphira, who snapped \\nit out of the air and swallowed it whole. Then he tore the loaf in two, gave \\nhalf to Eragon, picked up his bowl, and retreated to a corner.\\nThey ate \\nsilently. Murtagh jabbed at his food. “I’m going to sleep,” he announced, \\nputting down his bowl without another word.\\n“Good night,” \\nsaid Eragon. He lay next to Saphira, his arms under his head. She curled her \\nlong neck around him, like a cat wrapping its tail around itself, and laid her \\nhead alongside his. One of her wings extended over him like a blue tent, \\nenveloping him in darkness.\\nGood night, \\nlittle one.\\n\\nA small smile \\nlifted Eragon’s lips, but he was already asleep.\\nT HEGLORYOFTRONJHEIM\\nEragon jolted \\nupright as a growl sounded in his ear. Saphira was still asleep, her eyes \\nwandering sightlessly under her eyelids, and her upper lip trembled, as if she \\nwere going to snarl. He smiled, then jerked as she growled again.\\nShe must be \\ndreaming,he \\nrealized. He watched her for a minute, then carefully slid out from under her \\nwing. He stood and stretched. The room was cool, but not unpleasantly so. \\nMurtagh lay on his back in the far corner, his eyes closed.\\nAs Eragon \\nstepped around Saphira, Murtagh stirred. “Morning,” he said quietly, sitting \\nup.\\n“How long have \\nyou been awake?” asked Eragon in a hushed voice.\\n“Awhile. I’m \\nsurprised Saphira didn’t wake you sooner.”\\n“I was tired \\nenough to sleep through a thunderstorm,” said Eragon wryly. He sat by Murtagh \\nand rested his head against the wall. “Do you know what time it is?”\\n“No. It’s \\nimpossible to tell in here.”\\n“Has anyone come \\nto see us?”\\n“Not yet.”\\nThey sat \\ntogether without moving or speaking. Eragon felt oddly bound to Murtagh.I’ve \\nbeen carrying his father’s sword, which would have been his . . . his \\ninheritance. We’re alike in many ways, yet our outlook and upbringing are \\ntotally different. He thought of Murtagh’s scar and shivered.What man \\ncould do that to a child?\\nSaphira lifted \\nher head and blinked to clear her eyes. She sniffed the air, then yawned \\nexpansively, her rough tongue curling at the tip.Has anything happened? \\nEragon shook his head.I hope they give me more food than that snack last \\nnight. I’m hungry enough to eat a herd of cows.\\nThey’ll feed \\nyou,he \\nassured her.\\nThey’d better.She positioned \\nherself near the door and settled down to wait, tail flicking. Eragon closed \\nhis eyes, enjoying the rest. He dozed awhile, then got up and paced around. \\nBored, he examined one of the lanterns. It was made of a single piece of \\nteardrop-shaped glass, about twice the size of a lemon, and filled with soft \\nblue light that neither wavered nor flickered. Four slim metal ribs wrapped \\nsmoothly around the glass, meeting at the top to form a small hook and again at \\nthe bottom where they melded together into three graceful legs. The whole piece \\nwas quite attractive.\\nEragon’s \\ninspection was interrupted by voices outside the room. The door opened, and a \\ndozen warriors marched inside. The first man gulped when he saw Saphira. They \\nwere followed by Orik and the bald man, who declared, “You have been summoned \\nto Ajihad, leader of the Varden. If you must eat, do so while we march.” Eragon \\nand Murtagh stood together, watching him warily.\\n“Where are our \\nhorses? And can I have my sword and bow back?” asked Eragon.\\nThe bald man \\nlooked at him with disdain. “Your weapons will be returned to you when Ajihad \\nsees fit, not before. As for your horses, they await you in the tunnel. Now \\ncome!”\\nAs he turned to \\nleave, Eragon asked quickly, “How is Arya?”\\nThe bald man \\nhesitated. “I do not know. The healers are still with her.” He exited the room, \\naccompanied by Orik.\\nOne of the \\nwarriors motioned. “You go first.” Eragon went through the doorway, followed by \\nSaphira and Murtagh. They returned through the corridor they had traversed the \\nnight before, passing the statue of the quilled animal. When they reached the \\nhuge tunnel through which they had first entered the mountain, the bald man was \\nwaiting with Orik, who held Tornac’s and Snowfire’s reins.\\n“You will ride \\nsingle file down the center of the tunnel,” instructed the bald man. “If you \\nattempt to go anywhere else, you will be stopped.” When Eragon started to climb \\nonto Saphira, the bald man shouted, “No! Ride your horse until I tell you \\notherwise.”\\nEragon shrugged \\nand took Snowfire’s reins. He swung into the saddle, guided Snowfire in front \\nof Saphira, and told her,Stay close in case I need your help.\\nOf course,she said.\\nMurtagh mounted \\nTornac behind Saphira. The bald man examined their small line, then gestured at \\nthe warriors, who divided in half to surround them, giving Saphira as wide a \\nberth as possible. Orik and the bald man went to the head of the procession.\\nAfter looking \\nthem over once more, the bald man clapped twice and started walking forward. \\nEragon tapped Snowfire lightly on his flanks. The entire group headed toward \\nthe heart of the mountain. Echoes filled the tunnel as the horses’ hooves \\nstruck the hard floor, the sounds amplified in the deserted passageway. Doors \\nand gates occasionally disturbed the smooth walls, but they were always closed.\\nEragon marveled \\nat the sheer size of the tunnel, which had been mined with incredible skill—the \\nwalls, floor, and ceiling were crafted with flawless precision. The angles at \\nthe bases of the walls were perfectly square, and as far as he could tell, the \\ntunnel itself did not vary from its course by even an inch.\\nAs they proceeded, \\nEragon’s anticipation about meeting Ajihad increased. The leader of the Varden \\nwas a shadowy figure to the people within the Empire. He had risen to power \\nnearly twenty years ago and since then had waged a fierce war against King \\nGalbatorix. No one knew where he came from or even what he looked like. It was \\nrumored that he was a master strategist, a brutal fighter. With such a \\nreputation, Eragon worried about how they would be received. Still, knowing \\nthat Brom had trusted the Varden enough to serve them helped to allay his \\nfears.\\nSeeing Orik \\nagain had brought forth new questions in his mind. The tunnel was obviously \\ndwarf work—no one else could mine with such skill—but were the dwarves part of \\nthe Varden, or were they merely sheltering them? And who was the king that Orik \\nhad mentioned? Was it Ajihad? Eragon understood now that the Varden had been \\nable to escape discovery by hiding underground, but what about the elves? Where \\nwere they?\\nFor nearly an \\nhour the bald man led them through the tunnel, never straying nor turning.We’ve \\nprobably already gone a league, Eragon realized.Maybe they’re taking us \\nall the way through the mountain! At last a soft white glow became visible \\nahead of them. He strained his eyes, trying to discern its source, but it was \\nstill too far away to make out any details. The glow increased in strength as \\nthey neared it.\\nNow he could see \\nthick marble pillars laced with rubies and amethysts standing in rows along the \\nwalls. Scores of lanterns hung between the pillars, suffusing the air with \\nliquid brilliance. Gold tracery gleamed from the pillars’ bases like molten \\nthread. Arching over the ceiling were carved raven heads, their beaks open in \\nmid-screech. At the end of the hallway rested two colossal black doors, \\naccented by shimmering silver lines that depicted a seven-pointed crown that \\nspanned both sides.\\nThe bald man \\nstopped and raised a hand. He turned to Eragon. “You will ride upon your dragon \\nnow. Do not attempt to fly away. There will be people watching, so remember who \\nand what you are.”\\nEragon \\ndismounted Snowfire, and then clambered onto Saphira’s back.I think they \\nwant to show us off, she said as he settled into the saddle.\\nWe’ll see. I \\nwish I had Zar’roc,he \\nreplied, tightening the straps around his legs.\\nIt might be \\nbetter that you aren’t wearing Morzan’s sword when the Varden first see you. \\nTrue.“I’m ready,” \\nEragon said, squaring his shoulders.\\n“Good,” said the \\nbald man. He and Orik retreated to either side of Saphira, staying far enough \\nback so she was clearly in the lead. “Now walk to the doors, and once they \\nopen, follow the path. Go slowly.”\\nReady?asked Eragon.\\nOf course.Saphira \\napproached the doors at a measured pace. Her scales sparkled in the light, \\nsending glints of color dancing over the pillars. Eragon took a deep breath to \\nsteady his nerves.\\nWithout warning, \\nthe doors swung outward on hidden joints. As the rift widened between them, \\nrays of sunlight streamed into the tunnel, falling on Saphira and Eragon. \\nTemporarily blinded, Eragon blinked and squinted. When his eyes adjusted to the \\nlight, he gasped.\\nThey were inside \\na massive volcanic crater. Its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high \\nabove that Eragon could not judge the distance—it might have been more than a \\ndozen miles. A soft beam of light fell through the aperture, illuminating the \\ncrater’s center, though it left the rest of the cavernous expanse in hushed \\ntwilight.\\nThe crater’s far \\nside, hazy blue in the distance, looked to be nearly ten miles away. Giant \\nicicles hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long hung leagues above \\nthem like glistening daggers. Eragon knew from his experience in the valley \\nthat no one, not even Saphira, could reach those lofty points. Farther down the \\ncrater’s inner walls, dark mats of moss and lichen covered the rock.\\nHe lowered his \\ngaze and saw a wide cobblestone path extending from the doors’ threshold. The \\npath ran straight to the center of the crater, where it ended at the base of a \\nsnowy-white mountain that glittered like an uncut gem with thousands of colored \\nlights. It was less than a tenth of the height of the crater that loomed over \\nand around it, but its diminutive appearance was deceiving, for it was slightly \\nhigher than a mile.\\nLong as it was, \\nthe tunnel had only taken them through one side of the crater wall. As Eragon \\nstared, he heard Orik say deeply, “Look well, human, for no Rider has set eyes \\nupon this for nigh over a hundred years. The airy peak under which we stand is \\nFarthen Dûr—discovered thousands of years ago by the father of our race, \\nKorgan, while he tunneled for gold. And in the center stands our greatest \\nachievement: Tronjheim, the city-mountain built from the purest marble.” The \\ndoors grated to a halt.\\nA city! \\nThen Eragon saw \\nthe crowd. He had been so engrossed by the sights that he had failed to notice \\na dense sea of people clustered around the tunnel’s entrance. They lined the \\ncobblestone pathway—dwarves and humans packed together like trees in a thicket. \\nThere were hundreds . . . thousands of them. Every eye, every face was focused \\non Eragon. And every one of them was silent.\\nEragon gripped \\nthe base of one of Saphira’s neck spikes. He saw children in dirty smocks, \\nhardy men with scarred knuckles, women in homespun dresses, and stout, \\nweathered dwarves who fingered their beards. All of them bore the same taut \\nexpression—that of an injured animal when a predator is nearby and escape is \\nimpossible.\\nA bead of sweat \\nrolled down Eragon’s face, but he dared not move to wipe it away.What should \\nI do? he asked frantically.\\nSmile, raise \\nyour hand, anything!replied \\nSaphira sharply.\\nEragon tried to \\nforce out a smile, but his lips only twitched. Gathering his courage, he pushed \\na hand into the air, jerking it in a little wave. When nothing happened, he \\nflushed with embarrassment, lowered his arm, and ducked his head.\\nA single cheer \\nbroke the silence. Someone clapped loudly. For a brief second the crowd \\nhesitated, then a wild roar swept through it, and a wave of sound crashed over \\nEragon.\\n“Very good,” \\nsaid the bald man from behind him. “Now start walking.”\\nRelieved, Eragon \\nsat straighter and playfully asked Saphira,Shall we go? She arched her \\nneck and stepped forward. As they passed the first row of people, she glanced \\nto each side and exhaled a puff of smoke. The crowd quieted and shrank back, \\nthen resumed cheering, their enthusiasm only intensified.\\nShow-off,chided Eragon. \\nSaphira flicked her tail and ignored him. He stared curiously at the jostling \\ncrowd as she proceeded along the path. Dwarves greatly outnumbered humans . . . \\nand many of them glared at him resentfully. Some even turned their backs and \\nwalked away with stony faces.\\nThe humans were \\nhard, tough people. All the men had daggers or knives at their waists; many \\nwere armed for war. The women carried themselves proudly, but they seemed to \\nconceal a deep-abiding weariness. The few children and babies stared at Eragon \\nwith large eyes. He felt certain that these people had experienced much \\nhardship and that they would do whatever was necessary to defend themselves.\\nThe Varden had \\nfound the perfect hiding place. Farthen Dûr’s walls were too high for a dragon \\nto fly over, and no army could break through the entranceway, even if it \\nmanaged to find the hidden doors.\\nThe crowd \\nfollowed close behind them, giving Saphira plenty of room. Gradually the people \\nquieted, though their attention remained on Eragon. He looked back and saw \\nMurtagh riding stiffly, his face pale.\\nThey neared the \\ncity-mountain, and Eragon saw that the white marble of Tronjheim was highly \\npolished and shaped into flowing contours, as if it had been poured into place. \\nIt was dotted with countless round windows framed by elaborate carvings. A \\ncolored lantern hung in each window, casting a soft glow on the surrounding \\nrock. No turrets or smokestacks were visible. Directly ahead, two \\nthirty-foot-high gold griffins guarded a massive timber gate—recessed twenty \\nyards into the base of Tronjheim—which was shadowed by thick trusses that \\nsupported an arched vault far overhead.\\nWhen they \\nreached Tronjheim’s base, Saphira paused to see if the bald man had any \\ninstructions. When none were forthcoming, she continued to the gate. The walls \\nwere lined with fluted pillars of blood-red jasper. Between the pillars hulked \\nstatues of outlandish creatures, captured forever by the sculptor’s chisel.\\nThe heavy gate \\nrumbled open before them as hidden chains slowly raised the mammoth beams. A \\nfour-story-high passageway extended straight toward the center of Tronjheim. \\nThe top three levels were pierced by rows of archways that revealed gray tunnels \\ncurving off into the distance. Clumps of people filled the arches, eagerly \\nwatching Eragon and Saphira. On ground level, however, the archways were barred \\nby stout doors. Rich tapestries hung between the different levels, embroidered \\nwith heroic figures and tumultuous battle scenes.\\nA cheer rang in \\ntheir ears as Saphira stepped into the hall and paraded down it. Eragon raised \\nhis hand, eliciting another roar from the throng, though many of the dwarves \\ndid not join the welcoming shout.\\nThe mile-long \\nhall ended in an arch flanked by black onyx pillars. Yellow zircons three times \\nthe size of a man capped the dark columns, coruscating piercing gold beams \\nalong the hall. Saphira stepped through the opening, then stopped and craned \\nback her neck, humming deeply in her chest.\\nThey were in a \\ncircular room, perhaps a thousand feet across, that reached up to Tronjheim’s \\npeak a mile overhead, narrowing as it rose. The walls were lined with \\narches—one row for each level of the city-mountain—and the floor was made of \\npolished carnelian, upon which was etched a hammer girdled by twelve silver \\npentacles, like on Orik’s helm.\\nThe room was a \\nnexus for four hallways—including the one they had just exited—that divided \\nTronjheim into quarters. The halls were identical except for the one opposite \\nEragon. To the right and left of that hall were tall arches that opened to \\ndescending stairs, which mirrored each other as they curved underground.\\nThe ceiling was \\ncapped by a dawn-red star sapphire of monstrous size. The jewel was twenty \\nyards across and nearly as thick. Its face had been carved to resemble a rose \\nin full bloom, and so skilled was the craftsmanship, the flower almost seemed \\nto be real. A wide belt of lanterns wrapped around the edge of the sapphire, \\nwhich cast striated bands of blushing light over everything below. The flashing \\nrays of the star within the gem made it appear as if a giant eye gazed down at \\nthem.\\nEragon could \\nonly gape with wonder. Nothing had prepared him for this. It seemed impossible \\nthat Tronjheim had been built by mortal beings. The city-mountain shamed \\neverything he had seen in the Empire. He doubted if even Urû’baen could match \\nthe wealth and grandeur displayed here. Tronjheim was a stunning monument to \\nthe dwarves’ power and perseverance.\\nThe bald man \\nwalked in front of Saphira and said, “You must go on foot from here.” There was \\nscattered booing from the crowd as he spoke. A dwarf took Tornac and Snowfire \\naway. Eragon dismounted Saphira but stayed by her side as the bald man led them \\nacross the carnelian floor to the right-hand hallway.\\nThey followed it \\nfor several hundred feet, then entered a smaller corridor. Their guards \\nremained despite the cramped space. After four sharp turns, they came to a \\nmassive cedar door, stained black with age. The bald man pulled it open and \\nconducted everyone but the guards inside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA JIHAD \\nEragon entered an \\nelegant, two-story study paneled with rows of cedar bookshelves. A wrought-iron \\nstaircase wound up to a small balcony with two chairs and a reading table. \\nWhite lanterns hung along the walls and ceiling so a book could be read \\nanywhere in the room. The stone floor was covered by an intricate oval rug. At \\nthe far end of the room, a man stood behind a large walnut desk.\\nHis skin gleamed \\nthe color of oiled ebony. The dome of his head was shaved bare, but a closely \\ntrimmed black beard covered his chin and upper lip. Strong features shadowed \\nhis face, and grave, intelligent eyes lurked under his brow. His shoulders were \\nbroad and powerful, emphasized by a tapered red vest embroidered with gold \\nthread and clasped over a rich purple shirt. He bore himself with great \\ndignity, exuding an intense, commanding air.\\nWhen he spoke, \\nhis voice was strong, confident: “Welcome to Tronjheim, Eragon and Saphira. I \\nam Ajihad. Please, seat yourselves.”\\nEragon slipped \\ninto an armchair next to Murtagh, while Saphira settled protectively behind \\nthem. Ajihad raised his hand and snapped his fingers. A man stepped out from \\nbehind the staircase. He was identical to the bald man beside him. Eragon \\nstared at the two of them with surprise, and Murtagh stiffened. “Your confusion \\nis understandable; they are twin brothers,” said Ajihad with a small smile. “I \\nwould tell you their names, but they have none.”\\nSaphira hissed \\nwith distaste. Ajihad watched her for a moment, then sat in a high-backed chair \\nbehind the desk. The Twins retreated under the stairs and stood impassively \\nbeside each other. Ajihad pressed his fingers together as he stared at Eragon \\nand Murtagh. He studied them for a long time with an unwavering gaze.\\nEragon squirmed, \\nuncomfortable. After what seemed like several minutes, Ajihad lowered his hands \\nand beckoned to the Twins. One of them hurried to his side. Ajihad whispered in \\nhis ear. The bald man suddenly paled and shook his head vigorously. Ajihad \\nfrowned, then nodded as if something had been confirmed.\\nHe looked at \\nMurtagh. “You have placed me in a difficult position by refusing to be \\nexamined. You have been allowed into Farthen Dûr because the Twins have assured \\nme that they can control you and because of your actions on behalf of Eragon \\nand Arya. I understand that there may be things you wish to keep hidden in your \\nmind, but as long as you do, we cannot trust you.”\\n“You wouldn’t \\ntrust me anyway,” said Murtagh defiantly.\\nAjihad’s face \\ndarkened as Murtagh spoke, and his eyes flashed dangerously. “Though it’s been \\ntwenty and three years since it last broke upon my ear . . . I know that \\nvoice.” He stood ominously, chest swelling. The Twins looked alarmed and put \\ntheir heads together, whispering frantically. “It came from another man, one \\nmore beast than human. Get up.”\\nMurtagh warily \\ncomplied, his eyes darting between the Twins and Ajihad. “Remove your shirt,” \\nordered Ajihad. With a shrug, Murtagh pulled off his tunic. “Now turn around.” \\nAs he pivoted to the side, light fell upon the scar on his back.\\n“Murtagh,” \\nbreathed Ajihad. A grunt of surprise came from Orik. Without warning, Ajihad \\nturned on the Twins and thundered, “Did you know of this?”\\nThe Twins bowed \\ntheir heads. “We discovered his name in Eragon’s mind, but we did not suspect \\nthat thisboy was the son of one as powerful as Morzan. It never \\noccurred—”\\n“And you didn’t \\ntell me?” demanded Ajihad. He raised a hand, forestalling their explanation. \\n“We will discuss it later.” He faced Murtagh again. “First I must untangle this \\nmuddle. Do you still refuse to be probed?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nMurtagh sharply, slipping back into his tunic. “I won’t let anyone inside my \\nhead.”\\nAjihad leaned on \\nhis desk. “There will be unpleasant consequences if you don’t. Unless the Twins \\ncan certify that you aren’t a threat, we cannot give you credence, despite, and \\nperhaps because of, the assistance you have given Eragon. Without that \\nverification, the people here, dwarf and human alike, will tear you apart if \\nthey learn of your presence. I’ll be forced to keep you confined at all \\ntimes—as much for your protection as for ours. It will only get worse once the \\ndwarf king, Hrothgar, demands custody of you. Don’t force yourself into that \\nsituation when it can easily be avoided.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head stubbornly. “No . . . even if I were to submit, I would still be \\ntreated like a leper and an outcast. All I wish is to leave. If you let me do \\nthat peacefully, I’ll never reveal your location to the Empire.”\\n“What will \\nhappen if you are captured and brought before Galbatorix?” demanded Ajihad. “He \\nwill extract every secret from your mind, no matter how strong you may be. Even \\nif you could resist him, how can we trust that you won’t rejoin him in the \\nfuture? I cannot take that chance.”\\n“Will you hold \\nme prisoner forever?” demanded Murtagh, straightening.\\n“No,” said \\nAjihad, “only until you let yourself be examined. If you are found trustworthy, \\nthe Twins will remove all knowledge of Farthen Dûr’s location from your mind \\nbefore you leave. We won’t risk someone with those memories falling into \\nGalbatorix’s hands. What is it to be, Murtagh? Decide quickly or else the path \\nwill be chosen for you.”\\nJust give in,Eragon pleaded \\nsilently, concerned for Murtagh’s safety.It’s not worth the fight.\\nFinally Murtagh \\nspoke, the words slow and distinct. “My mind is the one sanctuary that has not \\nbeen stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I’ve learned to \\ndefend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts. You have \\nasked for the one thing I cannot give, least of all to those two.” He gestured \\nat the Twins. “Do with me what you will, but know this: death will take me \\nbefore I’ll expose myself to their probing.”\\nAdmiration \\nglinted in Ajihad’s eyes. “I’m not surprised by your choice, though I had hoped \\notherwise. . . . Guards!” The cedar door slammed open as warriors rushed in, \\nweapons ready. Ajihad pointed at Murtagh and commanded, “Take him to a \\nwindowless room and bar the door securely. Post six men by the entrance and \\nallow no one inside until I come to see him. Do not speak to him, either.”\\nThe warriors \\nsurrounded Murtagh, watching him suspiciously. As they left the study, Eragon \\ncaught Murtagh’s attention and mouthed, “I’m sorry.” Murtagh shrugged, then \\nstared forward resolutely. He vanished into the hallway with the men. The sound \\nof their feet faded into silence.\\nAjihad said \\nabruptly, “I want everyone out of this room but Eragon and Saphira. Now!”\\nBowing, the \\nTwins departed, but Orik said, “Sir, the king will want to know of Murtagh. And \\nthere is still the matter of my insubordination. . . .”\\nAjihad frowned, \\nthen waved his hand. “I will tell Hrothgar myself. As for your actions . . . \\nwait outside until I call for you. And don’t let the Twins get away. I’m not \\ndone with them, either.”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Orik, inclining his head. He closed the door with a solid thump.\\nAfter a long \\nsilence, Ajihad sat with a tired sigh. He ran a hand over his face and stared \\nat the ceiling. Eragon waited impatiently for him to speak. When nothing was \\nforthcoming, he blurted, “Is Arya all right?”\\nAjihad looked \\ndown at him and said gravely, “No . . . but the healers tell me she will \\nrecover. They worked on her all through the night. The poison took a dreadful \\ntoll on her. She wouldn’t have lived if not for you. For that you have the \\nVarden’s deepest thanks.”\\nEragon’s \\nshoulders slumped with relief. For the first time he felt that their flight \\nfrom Gil’ead had been worth the effort. “So, what now?” he asked.\\n“I need you to \\ntell me how you found Saphira and everything that’s happened since,” said \\nAjihad, forming a steeple with his fingers. “Some of it I know from the message \\nBrom sent us, other parts from the Twins. But I want to hear it from you, \\nespecially the details concerning Brom’s death.”\\nEragon was \\nreluctant to share his experiences with a stranger, but Ajihad was patient.Go \\non, urged Saphira gently. Eragon shifted, then began his story. It was \\nawkward at first but grew easier as he proceeded. Saphira helped him to \\nremember things clearly with occasional comments. Ajihad listened intently the \\nentire time.\\nEragon talked \\nfor hours, often pausing between his words. He told Ajihad of Teirm, though he \\nkept Angela’s fortunetelling to himself, and how he and Brom had found the \\nRa’zac. He even related his dreams of Arya. When he came to Gil’ead and \\nmentioned the Shade, Ajihad’s face hardened, and he leaned back with veiled \\neyes.\\nWhen his \\nnarrative was complete, Eragon fell silent, brooding on all that had occurred. \\nAjihad stood, clasped his hands behind his back, and absently studied one of \\nthe bookshelves. After a time he returned to the desk.\\n“Brom’s death is \\na terrible loss. He was a close friend of mine and a powerful ally of the \\nVarden. He saved us from destruction many times through his bravery and \\nintelligence. Even now, when he is gone, he’s provided us with the one thing \\nthat can ensure our success—you.”\\n“But what can \\nyou expect me to accomplish?” asked Eragon.\\n“I will explain \\nit in full,” said Ajihad, “but there are more urgent matters to be dealt with \\nfirst. The news of the Urgals’ alliance with the Empire is extremely serious. \\nIf Galbatorix is gathering an Urgal army to destroy us, the Varden will be hard \\npressed to survive, even though many of us are protected here in Farthen Dûr. \\nThat a Rider, even one as evil as Galbatorix, would consider a pact with such \\nmonsters is indeed proof of madness. I shudder to think of what he promised \\nthem in return for their fickle loyalty. And then there is the Shade. Can you \\ndescribe him?”\\nEragon nodded. \\n“He was tall, thin, and very pale, with red eyes and hair. He was dressed all \\nin black.”\\n“What of his \\nsword—did you see it?” asked Ajihad intensely. “Did it have a long scratch on \\nthe blade?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, surprised. “How did you know?”\\n“Because I put \\nit there while trying to cut out his heart,” said Ajihad with a grim smile. \\n“His name is Durza—one of the most vicious and cunning fiends to ever stalk \\nthis land. He is the perfect servant for Galbatorix and a dangerous enemy for \\nus. You say that you killed him. How was it done?”\\nEragon \\nremembered it vividly. “Murtagh shot him twice. The first arrow caught him in \\nthe shoulder; the second one struck him between the eyes.”\\n“I was afraid of \\nthat,” said Ajihad, frowning. “You didn’t kill him. Shades can only be \\ndestroyed by a thrust through the heart. Anything short of that will cause them \\nto vanish and then reappear elsewhere in spirit form. It’s an unpleasant \\nprocess, but Durza will survive and return stronger than ever.”\\nA moody silence \\nsettled over them like a foreboding thunderhead. Then Ajihad stated, “You are \\nan enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve. Everyone knows \\nwhat the Varden want—or the Urgals, or even Galbatorix—but no one knows whatyou \\nwant. And that makes you dangerous, especially to Galbatorix. He fears you \\nbecause he doesn’t know what you will do next.”\\n“Do the Varden \\nfear me?” asked Eragon quietly.\\n“No,” said \\nAjihad carefully. “We are hopeful. But if that hope proves false, then yes, we \\nwill be afraid.” Eragon looked down. “You must understand the unusual nature of \\nyour position. There are factions who want you to serve their interests and no \\none else’s. The moment you entered Farthen Dûr, their influence and power began \\ntugging on you.”\\n“Including \\nyours?” asked Eragon.\\nAjihad chuckled, \\nthough his eyes were sharp. “Including mine. There are certain things you \\nshould know: first is how Saphira’s egg happened to appear in the Spine. Did \\nBrom ever tell you what was done with her egg after he brought it here?”\\n“No,” said \\nEragon, glancing at Saphira. She blinked and flicked her tongue at him.\\nAjihad tapped \\nhis desk before beginning. “When Brom first brought the egg to the Varden, \\neveryone was deeply interested in its fate. We had thought the dragons were \\nexterminated. The dwarves were solely concerned with making sure that the \\nfuture Rider would be an ally—though some of them were opposed to having a new \\nRider at all—while the elves and Varden had a more personal stake in the \\nmatter. The reason was simple enough: throughout history all the Riders have \\nbeen either elven or human, with the majority being elven. There has never been \\na dwarf Rider.\\n“Because of \\nGalbatorix’s betrayals, the elves were reluctant to let any of the Varden \\nhandle the egg for fear that the dragon inside would hatch for a human with \\nsimilar instabilities. It was a challenging situation, as both sides wanted the \\nRider for their own. The dwarves only aggravated the problem by arguing \\nobstinately with both the elves and us whenever they had the chance. Tensions \\nescalated, and before long, threats were made that were later regretted. It was \\nthen that Brom suggested a compromise that allowed all sides to save face.\\n“He proposed \\nthat the egg be ferried between the Varden and the elves every year. At each \\nplace children would parade past it, and then the bearers of the egg would wait \\nto see if the dragon would hatch. If it didn’t, they would leave and return to \\nthe other group. But if the dragondid hatch, the new Rider’s training \\nwould be undertaken immediately. For the first year or so he or she would be \\ninstructed here, by Brom. Then the Rider would be taken to the elves, who would \\nfinish the education.\\n“The elves \\nreluctantly accepted this plan . . . with the stipulation that if Brom were to \\ndie before the dragon hatched, they would be free to train the new Rider \\nwithout interference. The agreement was slanted in their favor—we both knew \\nthat the dragon would likely chose an elf—but it provided a desperately needed \\nsemblance of equality.”\\nAjihad paused, \\nhis rich eyes somber. Shadows bit into his face under his cheekbones, making \\nthem jut out. “It was hoped that this new Rider would bring our two races \\ncloser together. We waited for well over a decade, but the egg never hatched. \\nThe matter passed from our minds, and we rarely thought about it except to \\nlament the egg’s inactivity.\\n“Then last year \\nwe suffered a terrible loss. Arya and the egg disappeared on her return from \\nTronjheim to the elven city Osilon. The elves were the first to discover she \\nwas missing. They found her steed and guards slain in Du Weldenvarden and a \\ngroup of slaughtered Urgals nearby. But neither Arya nor the egg was there. \\nWhen this news reached me, I feared that Urgals had both of them and would soon \\nlearn the location of Farthen Dûr and the elves’ capital, Ellesméra, where \\ntheir queen, Islanzadi, lives. Now I understand they were working for the \\nEmpire, which is far worse.\\n“We won’t know \\nexactly what occurred during that attack until Arya wakes, but I have deduced a \\nfew details from what you’ve said.” Ajihad’s vest rustled as he leaned his \\nelbows on the desk. “The attack must have been swift and decisive, else Arya \\nwould have escaped. Without any warning, and deprived of a place to hide, she could \\nhave done only one thing—used magic to transport the egg elsewhere.”\\n“She can use \\nmagic?” asked Eragon. Arya had mentioned that she had been given a drug to \\nsuppress her power; he wanted to confirm that she meant magic. He wondered if \\nshe could teach him more words of the ancient language.\\n“It was one of \\nthe reasons why she was chosen to guard the egg. Anyway, Arya couldn’t have \\nreturned it to us—she was too far away—and the elves’ realm is warded by arcane \\nbarriers that prevent anything from entering their borders through magical \\nmeans. She must have thought of Brom and, in desperation, sent the egg toward \\nCarvahall. Without time to prepare, I’m not surprised she missed by the margin \\nshe did. The Twins tell me it is an imprecise art.”\\n“Why was she closer \\nto Palancar Valley than the Varden?” asked Eragon. “Where do the elves really \\nlive? Where is this . . . Ellesméra?”\\nAjihad’s keen \\ngaze bored into Eragon as he considered the question. “I don’t tell you this \\nlightly, for the elves guard the knowledge jealously. But you should know, and \\nI do this as a display of trust. Their cities lie far to the north, in the \\ndeepest reaches of the endless forest Du Weldenvarden. Not since the Riders’ \\ntime has anyone, dwarf or human, been elf-friend enough to walk in their leafy \\nhalls. I do not even know how to find Ellesméra. As for Osilon . . . based on \\nwhere Arya disappeared, I suspect it is near Du Weldenvarden’s western edge, \\ntoward Carvahall. You must have many other questions, but bear with me and keep \\nthem until I have finished.”\\nHe gathered his \\nmemories, then spoke at a quickened pace. “When Arya disappeared, the elves \\nwithdrew their support from the Varden. Queen Islanzadi was especially enraged \\nand refused any further contact with us. As a result, even though I received \\nBrom’s message, the elves are still ignorant of you and Saphira. . . . Without \\ntheir supplies to sustain my troops, we have fared badly these past months in \\nskirmishes with the Empire.\\n“With Arya’s \\nreturn and your arrival, I expect the queen’s hostility will abate. The fact \\nthat you rescued Arya will greatly help our case with her. Your training, \\nhowever, is going to present a problem for both Varden and elves. Brom \\nobviously had a chance to teach you, but we need to know how thorough he was. \\nFor that reason, you’ll have to be tested to determine the extent of your \\nabilities. Also, the elves will expect you to finish your training with them, \\nthough I’m not sure if there’s time for that.”\\n“Why not?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“For several \\nreasons. Chief among them, the tidings you brought about the Urgals,” said \\nAjihad, his eyes straying to Saphira. “You see, Eragon, the Varden are in an \\nextremely delicate position. On one hand, we have to comply with the elves’ \\nwishes if we want to keep them as allies. At the same time, we cannot anger the \\ndwarves if we wish to lodge in Tronjheim.”\\n“Aren’t the \\ndwarves part of the Varden?” asked Eragon.\\nAjihad \\nhesitated. “In a sense, yes. They allow us to live here and provide assistance \\nin our struggle against the Empire, but they are loyal only to their king. I \\nhave no power over them except for what Hrothgar gives me, and even he often \\nhas trouble with the dwarf clans. The thirteen clans are subservient to \\nHrothgar, but each clan chief wields enormous power; they choose the new dwarf \\nking when the old one dies. Hrothgar is sympathetic to our cause, but many of \\nthe chiefs aren’t. He can’t afford to anger them unnecessarily or he’ll lose \\nthe support of his people, so his actions on our behalf have been severely \\ncircumscribed.”\\n“These clan \\nchiefs,” said Eragon, “are they against me as well?”\\n“Even more so, \\nI’m afraid,” said Ajihad wearily. “There has long been enmity between dwarves \\nand dragons—before the elves came and made peace, dragons made a regular habit \\nof eating the dwarves’ flocks and stealing their gold—and the dwarves are slow \\nto forget past wrongs. Indeed, they never fully accepted the Riders or allowed \\nthem to police their kingdom. Galbatorix’s rise to power has only served to \\nconvince many of them that it would be better never to deal with Riders or \\ndragons ever again.” He directed his last words at Saphira.\\nEragon said \\nslowly, “Why doesn’t Galbatorix know where Farthen Dûr and Ellesméra are? \\nSurely he was told of them when he was instructed by the Riders.”\\n“Told of them, yes—shown \\nwhere they are, no. It’s one thing to know that Farthen Dûr lies within these \\nmountains, quite another to find it. Galbatorix hadn’t been taken to either \\nplace before his dragon was killed. After that, of course, the Riders didn’t \\ntrust him. He tried to force the information out of several Riders during his \\nrebellion, but they chose to die rather than reveal it to him. As for the \\ndwarves, he’s never managed to capture one alive, though it’s only a matter of \\ntime.”\\n“Then why \\ndoesn’t he just take an army and march through Du Weldenvarden until he finds \\nEllesméra?” asked Eragon.\\n“Because the \\nelves still have enough power to resist him,” said Ajihad. “He doesn’t dare \\ntest his strength against theirs, at least not yet. But his cursed sorcery \\ngrows stronger each year. With another Rider at his side, he would be \\nunstoppable. He keeps trying to get one of his two eggs to hatch, but so far \\nhe’s been unsuccessful.”\\nEragon was \\npuzzled. “How can his power be increasing? The strength of his body limits his \\nabilities—it can’t build itself up forever.”\\n“We don’t know,” \\nsaid Ajihad, shrugging his broad shoulders, “and neither do the elves. We can \\nonly hope that someday he will be destroyed by one of his own spells.” He \\nreached inside his vest and somberly pulled out a battered piece of parchment. \\n“Do you know what this is?” he asked, placing it on the desk.\\nEragon bent \\nforward and examined it. Lines of black script, written in an alien language, \\nwere inked across the page. Large sections of the writing had been destroyed by \\nblots of blood. One edge of the parchment was charred. He shook his head. “No, \\nI don’t.”\\n“It was taken \\nfrom the leader of the Urgal host we destroyed last night. It cost us twelve \\nmen to do so—they sacrificed themselves so that you might escape safely. The \\nwriting is the king’s invention, a script he uses to communicate with his \\nservants. It took me a while, but I was able to devise its meaning, at least \\nwhere it’s legible. It reads:\\n\\xa0\\n. . . gatekeeper \\nat Ithrö Zhâda is to let this bearer and his minions pass. They are to be \\nbunked with the others of their kind and by . . . but only if the two factions \\nrefrain from fighting. Command will be given under Tarok, under Gashz, under \\nDurza, under Ushnark the Mighty.\\n\\xa0\\n“Ushnark is \\nGalbatorix. It means ‘father’ in the Urgal tongue, an affectation that pleases \\nhim.\\n\\xa0\\nFind what they \\nare suitable for and . . . The footmen and . . . are to be kept separate. No \\nweapons are to be distributed until . . . for marching.\\n\\xa0\\n“Nothing else \\ncan be read past there, except for a few vague words,” said Ajihad.\\n“Where’s Ithrö \\nZhâda? I’ve never heard of it.”\\n“Nor have I,” \\nconfirmed Ajihad, “which makes me suspect that Galbatorix has renamed an \\nexisting place for his own purposes. After deciphering this, I asked myself \\nwhat hundreds of Urgals were doing by the Beor Mountains where you first saw \\nthem and where they were going. The parchment mentions ‘others of their kind,’ \\nso I assume there are even more Urgals at their destination. There’s only one \\nreason for the king to gather such a force—to forge a bastard army of humans \\nand monsters to destroy us.\\n“For now, there \\nis nothing to do but wait and watch. Without further information we cannot find \\nthis Ithrö Zhâda. Still, Farthen Dûr has not yet been discovered, so there is \\nhope. The only Urgals to have seen it died last night.”\\n“How did you \\nknow we were coming?” asked Eragon. “One of the Twins was waiting for us, and \\nthere was an ambush in place for the Kull.” He was aware of Saphira listening \\nintently. Though she kept her own counsel, he knew she would have things to say \\nlater.\\n“We have \\nsentinels placed at the entrance of the valley you traveled through—on either \\nside of the Beartooth River. They sent a dove to warn us,” explained Ajihad.\\nEragon wondered \\nif it was the same bird Saphira had tried to eat. “When the egg and Arya \\ndisappeared, did you tell Brom? He said that he hadn’t heard anything from the \\nVarden.”\\n“We tried to \\nalert him,” said Ajihad, “but I suspect our men were intercepted and killed by \\nthe Empire. Why else would the Ra’zac have gone to Carvahall? After that, Brom \\nwas traveling with you, and it was impossible to get word to him. I was \\nrelieved when he contacted me via messenger from Teirm. It didn’t surprise me \\nthat he went to Jeod; they were old friends. And Jeod could easily send us a \\nmessage because he smuggles supplies to us through Surda.\\n“All of this has \\nraised serious questions. How did the Empire know where to ambush Arya and, \\nlater, our messengers to Carvahall? How has Galbatorix learned which merchants \\nhelp the Varden? Jeod’s business has been virtually destroyed since you left \\nhim, as have those of other merchants who support us. Every time one of their \\nships sets sail, it disappears. The dwarves cannot give us everything we need, \\nso the Varden are in desperate need of supplies. I’m afraid that we have a \\ntraitor, or traitors, in our midst, despite our efforts to examine people’s \\nminds for deceit.”\\nEragon sank deep \\nin thought, pondering what he had learned. Ajihad waited calmly for him to \\nspeak, undisturbed by the silence. For the first time since finding Saphira’s \\negg, Eragon felt that he understood what was going on around him. At last he \\nknew where Saphira came from and what might lie in his future. “What do you \\nwant from me?” he asked.\\n“How do you \\nmean?”\\n“I mean, what is \\nexpected of me in Tronjheim? You and the elves have plans for me, but what if I \\ndon’t like them?” A hard note crept into his voice. “I’ll fight when needed, \\nrevel when there’s occasion, mourn when there is grief, and die if my time \\ncomes . . . but I won’t let anyone use me against my will.” He paused to let \\nthe words sink in. “The Riders of old were arbiters of justice above and beyond \\nthe leaders of their time. I don’t claim that position—I doubt people would \\naccept such oversight when they’ve been free of it all their lives, especially \\nfrom one as young as me. But Ido have power, and I will wield it as I \\nsee fit. What I want to know is howyou plan to use me. Then I will \\ndecide whether to agree to it.”\\nAjihad looked at \\nhim wryly. “If you were anyone else and were before another leader, you would \\nlikely have been killed for that insolent speech. What makes you think I will \\nexpose my plans just because you demand it?” Eragon flushed but did not lower \\nhis gaze. “Still, you are right. Your position gives you the privilege to say \\nsuch things. You cannot escape the politics of your situation—youwill be \\ninfluenced, one way or another. I don’t want to see you become a pawn of any \\none group or purpose any more than you do. You must retain your freedom, for in \\nit lies your true power: the ability to make choices independent of any leader \\nor king. My own authority over you will be limited, but I believe it’s for the \\nbest. The difficulty lies in making sure that those with power include you in \\ntheir deliberations.\\n“Also, despite \\nyour protests, the people here have certain expectations of you. They are going \\nto bring you their problems, no matter how petty, and demand that you solve \\nthem.” Ajihad leaned forward, his voice deadly serious. “There will be cases \\nwhere someone’s future will rest in your hands . . . with a word you can send \\nthem careening into happiness or misery. Young women will seek your opinion on \\nwhom they should marry—many will pursue you as a husband—and old men will ask \\nwhich of their children should receive an inheritance. Youmust be kind \\nand wise with them all, for they put their trust in you. Don’t speak flippantly \\nor without thought, because your words will have impact far beyond what you \\nintend.”\\nAjihad leaned \\nback, his eyes hooded. “The burden of leadership is being responsible for the \\nwell-being of the people in your charge. I have dealt with it from the day I \\nwas chosen to head the Varden, and now you must as well. Be careful. I won’t \\ntolerate injustice under my command. Don’t worry about your youth and \\ninexperience; they will pass soon enough.”\\nEragon was \\nuncomfortable with the idea of people asking him for advice. “But you still \\nhaven’t said what I’m to do here.”\\n“For now, \\nnothing. You covered over a hundred and thirty leagues in eight days, a feat to \\nbe proud of. I’m sure that you’ll appreciate rest. When you’ve recovered, we \\nwill test your competency in arms and magic. After that—well, I will explain \\nyour options, and then you’ll have to decide your course.”\\n“And what about \\nMurtagh?” asked Eragon bitingly.\\nAjihad’s face \\ndarkened. He reached beneath his desk and lifted up Zar’roc. The sword’s \\npolished sheath gleamed in the light. Ajihad slid his hand over it, lingering \\non the etched sigil. “He will stay here until he allows the Twins into his \\nmind.”\\n“You can’t \\nimprison him,” argued Eragon. “He’s committed no crime!”\\n“We can’t give \\nhim his freedom without being sure that he won’t turn against us. Innocent or \\nnot, he’s potentially as dangerous to us as his father was,” said Ajihad with a \\nhint of sadness.\\nEragon realized \\nthat Ajihad would not be convinced otherwise, and his concernwas valid. \\n“How were you able to recognize his voice?”\\n“I met his \\nfather once,” said Ajihad shortly. He tapped Zar’roc’s hilt. “I wish Brom had \\ntold me he had taken Morzan’s sword. I suggest that you don’t carry it within \\nFarthen Dûr. Many here remember Morzan’s time with hate, especially the \\ndwarves.”\\n“I’ll remember \\nthat,” promised Eragon.\\nAjihad handed \\nZar’roc to him. “That reminds me, I have Brom’s ring, which he sent as \\nconfirmation of his identity. I was keeping it for when he returned to \\nTronjheim. Now that he’s dead, I suppose it belongs to you, and I think he \\nwould have wanted you to have it.” He opened a desk drawer and took the ring \\nfrom it.\\nEragon accepted \\nit with reverence. The symbol cut into the face of the sapphire was identical \\nto the tattoo on Arya’s shoulder. He fit the ring onto his index finger, \\nadmiring how it caught the light. “I . . . I am honored,” he said.\\nAjihad nodded \\ngravely, then pushed back his chair and stood. He faced Saphira and spoke to \\nher, his voice swelling in power. “Do not think that I have forgotten you, O \\nmighty dragon. I have said these things as much for your benefit as for \\nEragon’s. It is even more important that you know them, for to you falls the \\ntask of guarding him in these dangerous times. Do not underestimate your might \\nnor falter at his side, because without you he will surely fail.”\\nSaphira lowered \\nher head until their eyes were level and stared at him through slitted black \\npupils. They examined each other silently, neither of them blinking. Ajihad was \\nthe first to move. He lowered his eyes and said softly, “It is indeed a \\nprivilege to meet you.”\\nHe’ll do,said Saphira \\nrespectfully. She swung her head to face Eragon. Tell him that I am \\nimpressed both with Tronjheim and with him. The Empire is right to fear him. \\nLet him know, however, that if he had decided to kill you, I would have \\ndestroyed Tronjheim and torn him apart with my teeth.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, surprised by the venom in her voice, then relayed the message. \\nAjihad looked at her seriously. “I would expect nothing less from one so \\nnoble—but I doubt you could have gotten past the Twins.”\\nSaphira snorted \\nwith derision.Bah!\\nKnowing what she \\nmeant, Eragon said, “Then they must be much stronger than they appear. I think \\nthey would be sorely dismayed if they ever faced a dragon’s wrath. The two of \\nthem might be able to defeat me, but never Saphira. You should know, a Rider’s \\ndragon strengthens his magic beyond what a normal magician might have. Brom was \\nalways weaker than me because of that. I think that in the absence of Riders, \\nthe Twins have overestimated their power.”\\nAjihad looked \\ntroubled. “Brom was considered one of our strongest spell weavers. Only the \\nelves surpassed him. If what you say is true, we will have to reconsider a \\ngreat many things.” He bowed to Saphira. “As it is, I am glad it wasn’t \\nnecessary to harm either of you.” Saphira dipped her head in return.\\nAjihad \\nstraightened with a lordly air and called, “Orik!” The dwarf hurried into the \\nroom and stood before the desk, crossing his arms. Ajihad frowned at him, \\nirritated. “You’ve caused me a great deal of trouble, Orik. I’ve had to listen \\nto one of the Twins complain all morning about your insubordination. They won’t \\nlet it rest until you are punished. Unfortunately they’re right. It’s a serious \\nmatter that cannot be ignored. An accounting is due.”\\nOrik’s eyes \\nflicked toward Eragon, but his face betrayed no emotion. He spoke quickly in \\nrough tones. “The Kull were almost around Kóstha-mérna. They were shooting \\narrows at the dragon, Eragon, and Murtagh, but the Twins did nothing to stop \\nit. Like . . . sheilven, they refused to open the gates even though we could \\nsee Eragon shouting the opening phrase on the other side of the waterfall. And \\nthey refused to take action when Eragon did not rise from the water. Perhaps I \\ndid wrong, but I couldn’t let a Rider die.”\\n“I wasn’t strong \\nenough to get out of the water myself,” offered Eragon. “I would have drowned \\nif he hadn’t pulled me out.”\\nAjihad glanced \\nat him, then asked Orik seriously, “And later, why did you oppose them?”\\nOrik raised his \\nchin defiantly. “It wasn’t right for them to force their way into Murtagh’s \\nmind. But I wouldn’t have stopped them if I’d known who he was.”\\n“No, you did the \\nright thing, though it would be simpler if you hadn’t. It isn’t our place to \\nforce our way into people’s minds, no matter who they are.” Ajihad fingered his \\ndense beard. “Your actions were honorable, but you did defy a direct order from \\nyour commander. The penalty for that has always been death.” Orik’s back \\nstiffened.\\n“You can’t kill \\nhim for that! He was only helping me,” cried Eragon.\\n“It isn’t your \\nplace to interfere,” said Ajihad sternly. “Orik broke the law and must suffer \\nthe consequences.” Eragon started to argue again, but Ajihad stopped him with a \\nraised hand. “But you are right. The sentence will be mitigated because of the \\ncircumstances. As of now, Orik, you are removed from active service and \\nforbidden to engage in any military activities under my command. Do you \\nunderstand?”\\nOrik’s face \\ndarkened, but then he only looked confused. He nodded sharply. “Yes.”\\n“Furthermore, in \\nthe absence of your regular duties, I appoint you Eragon and Saphira’s guide \\nfor the duration of their stay. You are to make sure they receive every comfort \\nand amenity we have to offer. Saphira will stay above Isidar Mithrim. Eragon \\nmay have quarters wherever he wants. When he recovers from his trip, take him \\nto the training fields. They’re expecting him,” said Ajihad, a twinkle of \\namusement in his eye.\\nOrik bowed low. \\n“I understand.”\\n“Very well, you \\nall may go. Send in the Twins as you leave.”\\nEragon bowed and \\nbegan to leave, then asked, “Where can I find Arya? I would like to see her.”\\n“No one is \\nallowed to visit her. You will have to wait until she comes to you.” Ajihad \\nlooked down at his desk in a clear dismissal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nB LESS THECHILD,ARGETLAM\\nEragon stretched \\nin the hall; he was stiff from sitting so long. Behind him, the Twins entered \\nAjihad’s study and closed the door. Eragon looked at Orik. “I’m sorry that \\nyou’re in trouble because of me,” he apologized.\\n“Don’t bother \\nyourself,” grunted Orik, tugging on his beard. “Ajihad gave me what I wanted.”\\nEven Saphira was \\nstartled by the statement. “What do you mean?” said Eragon. “You can’t train or \\nfight, and you’re stuck guarding me. How can that be what you wanted?”\\nThe dwarf eyed \\nhim quietly. “Ajihad is a good leader. He understands how to keep the law yet \\nremain just. I have been punished by his command, but I’m also one of \\nHrothgar’s subjects. Under his rule, I’m still free to do what I wish.”\\nEragon realized \\nit would be unwise to forget Orik’s dual loyalty and the split nature of power \\nwithin Tronjheim. “Ajihad just placed you in a powerful position, didn’t he?”\\nOrik chuckled \\ndeeply. “That he did, and in such a way the Twins can’t complain about it. \\nThis’ll irritate them for sure. Ajihad’s a tricky one, he is. Come, lad, I’m \\nsure you’re hungry. And we have to get your dragon settled in.”\\nSaphira hissed. \\nEragon said, “Her name is Saphira.”\\nOrik made a \\nsmall bow to her. “My apologies, I’ll be sure to remember that.” He took an \\norange lamp from the wall and led them down the hallway.\\n“Can others in \\nFarthen Dûr use magic?” asked Eragon, struggling to keep up with the dwarf’s \\nbrisk pace. He cradled Zar’roc carefully, concealing the symbol on the sheath \\nwith his arm.\\n“Few enough,” \\nsaid Orik with a swift shrug under his mail. “And the ones we have can’t do \\nmuch more than heal bruises. They’ve all had to tend to Arya because of the \\nstrength needed to heal her.”\\n“Except for the \\nTwins.”\\n“Oeí,” grumbled \\nOrik. “She wouldn’t want their help anyway; their arts are not for healing. \\nTheir talents lie in scheming and plotting for power—to everyone else’s \\ndetriment. Deynor, Ajihad’s predecessor, allowed them to join the Varden \\nbecause he needed their support . . . you can’t oppose the Empire without \\nspellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle. They’re a nasty \\npair, but they do have their uses.”\\nThey entered one \\nof the four main tunnels that divided Tronjheim. Clusters of dwarves and humans \\nstrolled through it, voices echoing loudly off the polished floor. The \\nconversations stopped abruptly as they saw Saphira; scores of eyes fixed on \\nher. Orik ignored the spectators and turned left, heading toward one of \\nTronjheim’s distant gates. “Where are we going?” asked Eragon.\\n“Out of these \\nhalls so Saphira can fly to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim, the Star Rose. \\nThe dragonhold doesn’t have a roof—Tronjheim’s peak is open to the sky, like \\nthat of Farthen Dûr—so she, that is, you, Saphira, will be able to glide \\nstraight down into the hold. It is where the Riders used to stay when they \\nvisited Tronjheim.”\\n“Won’t it be \\ncold and damp without a roof?” asked Eragon.\\n“Nay.” Orik \\nshook his head. “Farthen Dûr protects us from the elements. Neither rain nor \\nsnow intrude here. Besides, the hold’s walls are lined with marble caves for \\ndragons. They provide all the shelter necessary. All you need fear are the \\nicicles; when they fall they’ve been known to cleave a horse in two.”\\nI will be fine,assured Saphira.A \\nmarble cave is safer than any of the other places we’ve stayed.\\nPerhaps . . . Do \\nyou think Murtagh will be all right? \\nAjihad strikes \\nme as an honorable man. Unless Murtagh tries to escape, I doubt he will be \\nharmed.\\n\\nEragon crossed \\nhis arms, unwilling to talk further. He was dazed by the change in \\ncircumstances from the day before. Their mad race from Gil’ead was finally \\nover, but his body expected to continue running and riding. “Where are our \\nhorses?”\\n“In the stables \\nby the gate. We can visit them before leaving Tronjheim.”\\n\\xa0\\nThey exited \\nTronjheim through the same gate they had entered. The gold griffins gleamed with \\ncolored highlights garnered from scores of lanterns. The sun had moved during \\nEragon’s talk with Ajihad—light no longer entered Farthen Dûr through the \\ncrater opening. Without those moted rays, the inside of the hollow mountain was \\nvelvety black. The only illumination came from Tronjheim, which sparkled \\nbrilliantly in the gloom. The city-mountain’s radiance was enough to brighten \\nthe ground hundreds of feet away.\\nOrik pointed at \\nTronjheim’s white pinnacle. “Fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there,” \\nhe told Saphira. “You may stay in any of the caves. Once you make your choice, \\nbedding will be laid down in it and then no one will disturb you.”\\n“I thought we \\nwere going to go together. I don’t want to be separated,” protested Eragon.\\nOrik turned to \\nhim. “Rider Eragon, I will do everything to accommodate you, but it would be \\nbest if Saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat. The tunnels to the \\nbanquet halls aren’t large enough for her to accompany us.”\\n“Why can’t you \\njust bring me food in the hold?”\\n“Because,” said \\nOrik with a guarded expression, “the food is prepared down here, and it is a \\nlong way to the top. If you wish, a servant could be sent up to the hold with a \\nmeal for you. It will take some time, but you could eat with Saphira then.”\\nHe actually \\nmeans it,Eragon \\nthought, astonished that they would do so much for him. But the way Orik said \\nit made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow.\\nI’m weary,said Saphira.And \\nthis dragonhold sounds to my liking. Go, have your meal, then come to me. It \\nwill be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers. We \\nhave suffered the hardships of the trail too long.\\nEragon looked at \\nher thoughtfully, then said to Orik, “I’ll eat down here.” The dwarf smiled, \\nseeming satisfied. Eragon unstrapped Saphira’s saddle so she could lie down \\nwithout discomfort.Would you take Zar’roc with you?\\nYes,she said, \\ngathering up the sword and saddle with her claws.But keep your bow. We must \\ntrust these people, though not to the point of foolishness.\\nI know,he said, \\ndisquieted.\\nWith an \\nexplosive leap Saphira swept off the ground and into the still air. The steady \\nwhoosh of her wings was the only sound in the darkness. As she disappeared over \\nthe rim of Tronjheim’s peak, Orik let out a long breath. “Ah boy, you have been \\nblessed indeed. I find a sudden longing in my heart for open skies and soaring \\ncliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk. Still, my feet are better on the \\nground—preferably under it.”\\nHe clapped his \\nhands loudly. “I neglect my duties as host. I know you’ve not dined since that \\npitiful dinner the Twins saw fit to give you, so come, let’s find the cooks and \\nbeg meat and bread from them!”\\nEragon followed \\nthe dwarf back into Tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they \\ncame to a long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for \\ndwarves. Fires blazed in soapstone ovens behind a long counter.\\nOrik spoke words \\nin an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddy-faced dwarf, who promptly handed \\nthem stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish. Then Orik took \\nEragon up several flights of stairs and into a small alcove carved out of \\nTronjheim’s outer wall, where they sat cross-legged. Eragon wordlessly reached \\nfor his food.\\nWhen their \\nplatters were empty, Orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a long-stemmed \\npipe. He lit it, saying, “A worthy repast, though it needed a good draught of \\nmead to wash it down properly.”\\nEragon surveyed \\nthe ground below. “Do you farm in Farthen Dûr?”\\n“No, there’s \\nonly enough sunlight for moss, mushrooms, and mold. Tronjheim cannot survive \\nwithout supplies from the surrounding valleys, which is one reason why many of \\nus choose to live elsewhere in the Beor Mountains.”\\n“Then there are \\nother dwarf cities?”\\n“Not as many as \\nwe would like. And Tronjheim is the greatest of them.” Leaning on an elbow, \\nOrik took a deep pull on his pipe. “You have only seen the lower levels, so it \\nhasn’t been apparent, but most of Tronjheim is deserted. The farther up you go, \\nthe emptier it gets. Entire floors have remained untouched for centuries. Most \\ndwarves prefer to dwell under Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr in the caverns and \\npassageways that riddle the rock. Through the centuries we have tunneled \\nextensively under the Beor Mountains. It is possible to walk from one end of \\nthe mountain range to the other without ever setting foot on the surface.”\\n“It seems like a \\nwaste to have all that unused space in Tronjheim,” commented Eragon.\\nOrik nodded. \\n“Some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our \\nresources, but Tronjheim does perform one invaluable task.”\\n“What’s that?”\\n“In times of \\nmisfortune it can house our entire nation. There have been only three instances \\nin our history when we have been forced to that extreme, but each time it has saved \\nus from certain and utter destruction. That is why we always keep it \\ngarrisoned, ready for use.”\\n“I’ve never seen \\nanything as magnificent,” admitted Eragon.\\nOrik smiled \\naround his pipe. “I’m glad you find it so. It took generations to build \\nTronjheim—and our lives are much longer than those of men. Unfortunately, \\nbecause of the cursed Empire, few outsiders are allowed to see its glory.”\\n“How many Varden \\nare here?”\\n“Dwarves or \\nhumans?”\\n“Humans—I want \\nto know how many have fled the Empire.”\\nOrik exhaled a \\nlong puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head. “There are about four \\nthousand of your kin here. But that’s a poor indicator of what you want to \\nknow. Only people who wish to fight come here. The rest of them are under King \\nOrrin’s protection in Surda.”\\nSo few?thought Eragon \\nwith a sinking feeling. The royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand \\nwhen it was fully marshaled, not counting the Urgals. “Why doesn’t Orrin fight \\nthe Empire himself?” he asked.\\n“If he were to \\nshow open hostility,” said Orik, “Galbatorix would crush him. As it is, \\nGalbatorix withholds that destruction because he considers Surda a minor \\nthreat, which is a mistake. It’s through Orrin’s assistance that the Varden \\nhave most of their weapons and supplies. Without him, there would be no \\nresisting the Empire.\\n“Don’t despair \\nover the number of humans in Tronjheim. There are many dwarves here—many more \\nthan you have seen—and all will fight when the time comes. Orrin has also \\npromised us troops for when we battle Galbatorix. The elves pledged their help \\nas well.”\\nEragon absently \\ntouched Saphira’s mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto. He \\nnoticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on Orik’s helm. “What does that \\nmean? I saw it on the floor in Tronjheim.”\\nOrik lifted the \\niron-bound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving. “It \\nis the symbol of my clan. We are the Ingietum, metalworkers and master smiths. \\nThe hammer and stars are inlaid into Tronjheim’s floor because it was the \\npersonal crest of Korgan, our founder. One clan to rule, with twelve \\nsurrounding. King Hrothgar is Dûrgrimst Ingietum as well and has brought my \\nhouse much glory, much honor.”\\nWhen they \\nreturned the platters to the cook, they passed a dwarf in the hall. He stopped before \\nEragon, bowed, and said respectfully, “Argetlam.”\\nThe dwarf left \\nEragon fumbling for an answer, flushed with unease, yet also strangely pleased \\nwith the gesture. No one had bowed to him before. “What did he say?” he asked, \\nleaning closer to Orik.\\nOrik shrugged, \\nembarrassed. “It’s an elven word that was used to refer to the Riders. It means \\n‘silver hand.’ ” Eragon glanced at his gloved hand, thinking of the gedwëy \\nignasia that whitened his palm. “Do you wish to return to Saphira?”\\n“Is there \\nsomewhere I could bathe first? I haven’t been able to wash off the grime of the \\nroad for a long time. Also, my shirt is bloodstained and torn, and it stinks. \\nI’d like to replace it, but I don’t have any money to buy a new one. Is there a \\nway I could work for one?”\\n“Do you seek to \\ninsult Hrothgar’s hospitality, Eragon?” demanded Orik. “As long as you are in \\nTronjheim, you won’t have to buy a thing. You’ll pay for it in other \\nways—Ajihad and Hrothgar will see to that. Come. I’ll show you where to wash, \\nthen fetch you a shirt.”\\nHe took Eragon \\ndown a long staircase until they were well below Tronjheim. The corridors were \\ntunnels now—which cramped Eragon because they were only five feet high—and all \\nthe lanterns were red. “So the light doesn’t blind you when you leave or enter \\na dark cavern,” explained Orik.\\nThey entered a \\nbare room with a small door on the far side. Orik pointed. “The pools are \\nthrough there, along with brushes and soap. Leave your clothes here. I’ll have \\nnew ones waiting when you get out.”\\nEragon thanked \\nhim and started to undress. It felt oppressive being alone underground, \\nespecially with the low rock ceiling. He stripped quickly and, cold, hurried \\nthrough the door, into total darkness. He inched forward until his foot touched \\nwarm water, then eased himself into it.\\nThe pool was \\nmildly salty, but soothing and calm. For a moment he was afraid of drifting \\naway from the door, into deeper water, but as he waded forward, he discovered \\nthe water reached only to his waist. He groped over a slippery wall until he \\nfound the soap and brushes, then scrubbed himself. Afterward he floated with \\nhis eyes closed, enjoying the warmth.\\nWhen he emerged, \\ndripping, into the lighted room, he found a towel, a fine linen shirt, and a \\npair of breeches. The clothes fit him reasonably well. Satisfied, he went out \\ninto the tunnel.\\nOrik was waiting \\nfor him, pipe in hand. They climbed the stairs back up into Tronjheim, then \\nexited the city-mountain. Eragon gazed at Tronjheim’s peak and called Saphira \\nwith his mind. As she flew down from the dragonhold, he asked, “How do you \\ncommunicate with people at the top of Tronjheim?”\\nOrik chuckled. \\n“That’s a problem we solved long ago. You didn’t notice, but behind the open \\narches that line each level is a single, unbroken staircase that spirals around \\nthe wall of Tronjheim’s central chamber. The stairs climb all the way to the \\ndragonhold above Isidar Mithrim. We call it Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. \\nRunning up or down it isn’t swift enough for an emergency, nor convenient \\nenough for casual use. Instead, we use flashing lanterns to convey messages. \\nThere is another way too, though it is seldom used. When Vol Turin was \\nconstructed, a polished trough was cut next to it. The trough acts as a giant \\nslide as high as a mountain.”\\nEragon’s lips \\ntwitched with a smile. “Is it dangerous?”\\n“Do not think of \\ntrying it. The slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man. If you \\nslipped out of it, you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches, \\nperhaps even into empty space.”\\nSaphira landed a \\nspear’s throw away, her scales rustling dryly. As she greeted Eragon, humans \\nand dwarves trickled out of Tronjheim, gathering around her with murmurs of \\ninterest. Eragon regarded the growing crowd uneasily. “You’d better go,” said \\nOrik, pushing him forward. “Meet me by this gate tomorrow morning. I’ll be \\nwaiting.”\\nEragon balked. \\n“How will I know when it’s morning?”\\n“I’ll have \\nsomeone wake you. Now go!” Without further protest, Eragon slipped through the \\njostling group that surrounded Saphira and jumped onto her back.\\nBefore she could \\ntake off, an old woman stepped forward and grasped Eragon’s foot with a fierce \\ngrip. He tried to pull away, but her hand was like an iron talon around his \\nankle—he could not break her tenacious hold. The burning gray eyes she fixed on \\nhim were surrounded by a lifetime’s worth of wrinkles—the skin was folded in \\nlong creases down her sunken cheeks. A tattered bundle rested in the crook of \\nher left arm.\\nFrightened, \\nEragon asked, “What do you want?”\\nThe woman tilted \\nher arm, and a cloth fell from the bundle, revealing a baby’s face. Hoarse and \\ndesperate, she said, “The child has no parents—there is no one to care for her \\nbut me, and I am weak. Bless her with your power, Argetlam. Bless her for \\nluck!”\\nEragon looked to \\nOrik for help, but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression. The small \\ncrowd fell silent, waiting for his response. The woman’s eyes were still \\nfastened on him. “Bless her, Argetlam, bless her,” she insisted.\\nEragon had never \\nblessed anyone. It was not something done lightly in Alagaësia, as a blessing \\ncould easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boon—especially if it was \\nspoken with ill intent or lack of conviction.Do I dare take that \\nresponsibility? he wondered.\\n“Bless her, Argetlam, \\nbless her.”\\nSuddenly \\ndecided, he searched for a phrase or expression to use. Nothing came to mind \\nuntil, inspired, he thought of the ancient language. This would be a true \\nblessing, spoken with words of power, by one of power.\\nHe bent down and \\ntugged the glove off his right hand. Laying his palm on the babe’s brow, he \\nintoned, “Atra gülai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waíse skölir frá rauthr.” \\nThe words left him unexpectedly weak, as if he had used magic. He slowly pulled \\nthe glove back on and said to the woman, “That is all I can do for her. If any \\nwords have the power to forestall tragedy, it will be those.”\\n“Thank you, \\nArgetlam,” she whispered, bowing slightly. She started to cover the baby again, \\nbut Saphira snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child. The woman \\ngrew rigid; her breath caught in her chest. Saphira lowered her snout and \\nbrushed the baby between the eyes with the tip of her nose, then smoothly \\nlifted away.\\nA gasp ran \\nthrough the crowd, for on the child’s forehead, where Saphira had touched her, \\nwas a star-shaped patch of skin as white and silvery as Eragon’s gedwëy \\nignasia. The woman stared at Saphira with a feverish gaze, wordless thanks in \\nher eyes.\\nImmediately \\nSaphira took flight, battering the awestruck spectators with the wind from her \\npowerful wing strokes. As the ground dwindled away, Eragon took a deep breath \\nand hugged her neck tightly.What did you do? he asked softly.\\nI gave her hope. \\nAnd you gave her a future. \\nLoneliness \\nsuddenly flowered within Eragon, despite Saphira’s presence. Their surroundings \\nwere so foreign—it struck him for the first time exactly how far he was from \\nhome. A destroyed home, but still where his heart lay.What have I become, \\nSaphira? he asked.I’m only in the first year of manhood, yet I’ve \\nconsulted with the leader of the Varden, am pursued by Galbatorix, and have \\ntraveled with Morzan’s son—and now blessings are sought from me! What wisdom \\ncan I give people that they haven’t already learned? What feats can I achieve \\nthat an army couldn’t do better? It’s insanity! I should be back in Carvahall \\nwith Roran.\\nSaphira took a \\nlong time to answer, but her words were gentle when they came.A hatchling, \\nthat is what you are. A hatchling struggling into the world. I may be younger \\nthan you in years, but I am ancient in my thoughts. Do not worry about these \\nthings. Find peace in where and what you are. People often know what must be \\ndone. All you need do is show them the way—that is wisdom. As for feats, no \\narmy could have given the blessing you did.\\nBut it was \\nnothing,he \\nprotested.A trifle.\\nNay, it wasn’t. \\nWhat you saw was the beginning of another story, another legend. Do you think \\nthat child will ever be content to be a tavern keeper or a farmer when her brow \\nis dragon-marked and your words hang over her? You underestimate our power and \\nthat of fate.\\n\\nEragon bowed his \\nhead.It’s overwhelming. I feel as if I am living in an illusion, a dream \\nwhere all things are possible. Amazing things do happen, I know, but always to \\nsomeone else, always in some far-off place and time. But I found your egg, was \\ntutored by a Rider, and dueled a Shade—those can’t be the actions of the farm \\nboy I am, or was. Something is changing me.\\nIt is your wyrd \\nthat shapes you,said \\nSaphira.Every age needs an icon—perhaps that lot has fallen to you. Farm \\nboys are not named for the first Rider without cause. Your namesake was the \\nbeginning, and now you are the continuation. Or the end.\\nAch,said Eragon, \\nshaking his head.It’s like speaking in riddles. . . . But if all is \\nforeordained, do our choices mean anything? Or must we just learn to accept our \\nfate?\\nSaphira said \\nfirmly,Eragon, I chose you from within my egg. You have been given a chance \\nmost would die for. Are you unhappy with that? Clear your mind of such \\nthoughts. They cannot be answered and will make you no happier.\\nTrue,he said glumly.All \\nthe same, they continue to bounce around within my skull.\\nThings have been \\n. . . unsettled . . . ever since Brom died. It has made me uneasy,acknowledged \\nSaphira, which surprised him because she rarely seemed perturbed. They were \\nabove Tronjheim now. Eragon looked down through the opening in its peak and saw \\nthe floor of the dragonhold: Isidar Mithrim, the great star sapphire. He knew that \\nbeneath it was nothing but Tronjheim’s great central chamber. Saphira descended \\nto the dragonhold on silent wings. She slipped over its rim and dropped to \\nIsidar Mithrim, landing with the sharp clack of claws.\\nWon’t you \\nscratch it?asked \\nEragon.\\nI think not. \\nIt’s no ordinary gem.Eragon \\nslid off her back and slowly turned in a circle, absorbing the unusual sight. \\nThey were in a round roofless room sixty feet high and sixty feet across. The \\nwalls were lined with the dark openings of caves, which differed in size from \\ngrottoes no larger than a man to a gaping cavern larger than a house. Shiny \\nrungs were set into the marble walls so that people could reach the highest \\ncaves. An enormous archway led out of the dragonhold.\\nEragon examined \\nthe great gem under his feet and impulsively lay down on it. He pressed his \\ncheek against the cool sapphire, trying to see through it. Distorted lines and \\nwavering spots of color glimmered through the stone, but its thickness made it \\nimpossible to discern anything clearly on the floor of the chamber a mile below \\nthem.\\nWill I have to \\nsleep apart from you?\\n\\nSaphira shook \\nher enormous head.No, there is a bed for you in my cave. Come see. She \\nturned and, without opening her wings, jumped twenty feet into the air, landing \\nin a medium-sized cave. He clambered up after her.\\nThe cave was \\ndark brown on the inside and deeper than he had expected. The roughly chiseled \\nwalls gave the impression of a natural formation. Near the far wall was a thick \\ncushion large enough for Saphira to curl up on. Beside it was a bed built into \\nthe side of the wall. The cave was lit by a single red lantern equipped with a \\nshutter so its glow could be muted.\\nI like this,said Eragon.It \\nfeels safe.\\nYes.Saphira curled \\nup on the cushion, watching him. With a sigh he sank onto the mattress, \\nweariness seeping through him.\\nSaphira, you \\nhaven’t said much while we’ve been here. What do you think of Tronjheim and \\nAjihad?\\n\\nWe shall see. . \\n. . It seems, Eragon, that we are embroiled in a new type of warfare here. \\nSwords and claws are useless, but words and alliances may have the same effect. \\nThe Twins dislike us—we should be on our guard for any duplicities they might \\nattempt. Not many of the dwarves trust us. The elves didn’t want a human Rider, \\nso there will be opposition from them as well. The best thing we can do is \\nidentify those in power and befriend them. And quickly, too. \\nDo you think \\nit’s possible to remain independent of the different leaders? \\nShe shuffled her \\nwings into a more comfortable position.Ajihad supports our freedom, but we \\nmay be unable to survive without pledging our loyalty to one group or another. \\nWe’ll soon know either way.\\nM ANDRAKEROOTANDNEWT’STONGUE\\nThe blankets were \\nbunched underneath Eragon when he woke, but he was still warm. Saphira was \\nasleep on her cushion, her breath coming in steady gusts.\\nFor the first \\ntime since entering Farthen Dûr, Eragon felt secure and hopeful. He was warm \\nand fed and had been able to sleep as long as he liked. Tension unknotted \\ninside him—tension that had been accumulating since Brom’s death and, even \\nbefore, since leaving Palancar Valley.\\nI don’t have to \\nbe afraid anymore. But what about Murtagh?No matter the Varden’s \\nhospitality, Eragon could not accept it in good conscience, knowing \\nthat—intentionally or not—he had led Murtagh to his imprisonment. Somehow the \\nsituation had to be resolved.\\nHis gaze roamed \\nthe cave’s rough ceiling as he thought of Arya. Chiding himself for \\ndaydreaming, he tilted his head and looked out at the dragonhold. A large cat \\nsat on the edge of the cave, licking a paw. It glanced at him, and he saw a \\nflash of slanted red eyes.\\nSolembum?he asked \\nincredulously.\\nObviously.The werecat \\nshook his rough mane and yawned languorously, displaying his long fangs. He \\nstretched, then jumped out of the cave, landing with a solid thump on Isidar \\nMithrim, twenty feet below.Coming?\\nEragon looked at \\nSaphira. She was awake now, watching him motionlessly.Go. I will be fine, \\nshe murmured. Solembum was waiting for him under the arch that led to the rest \\nof Tronjheim.\\nThe moment \\nEragon’s feet touched Isidar Mithrim, the werecat turned with a flick of his \\npaws and disappeared through the arch. Eragon chased after him, rubbing the \\nsleep from his face. He stepped through the archway and found himself standing \\nat the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. There was nowhere else to go, \\nso he descended to the next level.\\nHe stood in an \\nopen arcade that curved gently to the left and encircled Tronjheim’s central \\nchamber. Between the slender columns supporting the arches, Eragon could see \\nIsidar Mithrim sparkling brilliantly above him, as well as the city-mountain’s \\ndistant base. The circumference of the central chamber increased with each \\nsuccessive level. The staircase cut through the arcade’s floor to an identical \\nlevel below and descended through scores of arcades until it disappeared in the \\ndistance. The sliding trough ran along the outside curve of the stairs. At the \\ntop of Vol Turin was a pile of leather squares to slide on. To Eragon’s right, \\na dusty corridor led to that level’s rooms and apartments. Solembum padded down \\nthe hall, flipping his tail.\\nWait,said Eragon.\\nHe tried to \\ncatch up with Solembum, but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned \\npassageways. Then, as Eragon rounded a corner, he saw the werecat stop before a \\ndoor and yowl. Seemingly of its own accord, the door slid inward. Solembum \\nslipped inside, then the door shut. Eragon halted in front of it, perplexed. He \\nraised his hand to knock, but before he did, the door opened once more, and \\nwarm light spilled out. After a moment’s indecision he stepped inside.\\nHe entered an \\nearthy two-room suite, lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants. \\nThe air was warm, fresh, and humid. Bright lanterns hung on the walls and from \\nthe low ceiling. Piles of intriguing items cluttered the floor, obscuring the \\ncorners. A large four-poster bed, curtained by even more plants, was in the far \\nroom.\\nIn the center of \\nthe main room, on a plush leather chair, sat the fortuneteller and witch, \\nAngela. She smiled brightly.\\n“What are you \\ndoing here?” blurted Eragon.\\nAngela folded \\nher hands in her lap. “Well, why don’t you sit on the floor and I’ll tell you? \\nI’d offer you a chair, but I’m sitting on the only one.” Questions buzzed \\nthrough Eragon’s mind as he settled between two flasks of acrid bubbling green \\npotions.\\n“So!” exclaimed \\nAngela, leaning forward. “Youare a Rider. I suspected as much, but I \\ndidn’t know for certain until yesterday. I’m sure Solembum knew, but he never \\ntold me. I should have figured it out the moment you mentioned Brom. Saphira . \\n. . I like the name—fitting for a dragon.”\\n“Brom’s dead,” \\nsaid Eragon abruptly. “The Ra’zac killed him.”\\nAngela was taken \\naback. She twirled a lock of her dense curls. “I’m sorry. I truly am,” she said \\nsoftly.\\nEragon smiled bitterly. \\n“But not surprised, are you? You foretold his death, after all.”\\n“I didn’t know \\nwhose death it would be,” she said, shaking her head. “But no . . . I’m not \\nsurprised. I met Brom once or twice. He didn’t care for my ‘frivolous’ attitude \\ntoward magic. It irritated him.”\\nEragon frowned. \\n“In Teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke. \\nWhy?”\\nAngela’s face \\ntightened momentarily. “In retrospect, it was in rather bad taste, but I didn’t \\nknow what would befall him. How do I put this? . . . Brom was cursed in a way. \\nIt was his wyrd to fail at all of his tasks except one, although through no \\nfault of his own. He was chosen as a Rider, but his dragon was killed. He loved \\na woman, but it was his affection that was her undoing. And he was chosen, I \\nassume, to guard and train you, but in the end he failed at that as well. The \\nonly thing he succeeded at was killing Morzan, and a better deed he couldn’t \\nhave done.”\\n“Brom never \\nmentioned a woman to me,” retorted Eragon.\\nAngela shrugged \\ncarelessly. “I heard it from one who couldn’t have lied. But enough of this \\ntalk! Life goes on, and we should not trouble the dead with our worries.” She \\nscooped a pile of reeds from the floor and deftly started plaiting them \\ntogether, closing the subject to discussion.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then gave in. “All right. So why are you in Tronjheim instead of \\nTeirm?”\\n“Ah, at last an \\ninteresting question,” said Angela. “After hearing Brom’s name again during \\nyour visit, I sensed a return of the past in Alagaësia. People were whispering \\nthat the Empire was hunting a Rider. I knew then that the Varden’s dragon egg \\nmust have hatched, so I closed my shop and set out to learn more.”\\n“You knew about \\nthe egg?”\\n“Of course I \\ndid. I’m not an idiot. I’ve been around much longer than you would believe. \\nVery little happens that I don’t know about.” She paused and concentrated on \\nher weaving. “Anyway, I knew I had to get to the Varden as fast as possible. \\nI’ve been here for nearly a month now, though I really don’t care for this \\nplace—it’s far too musty for my taste. And everyone in Farthen Dûr isso \\nserious and noble. They’re probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway.” She \\ngave a long sigh, a mocking expression on her face. “And the dwarves are just a \\nsuperstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their lives. The \\nonly redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow \\ninside Farthen Dûr.”\\n“Then why stay?” \\nasked Eragon, smiling.\\n“Because I like \\nto be wherever important events are occurring,” said Angela, cocking her head. \\n“Besides, if I had stayed in Teirm, Solembum would have left without me, and I \\nenjoy his company. But tell me, what adventures have befallen you since last we \\ntalked?”\\nFor the next \\nhour, Eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months. \\nAngela listened quietly, but when he mentioned Murtagh’s name she sputtered, \\n“Murtagh!”\\nEragon nodded. \\n“He told me who he is. But let me finish my story before you make any \\njudgments.” He continued with his tale. When it was complete, Angela leaned \\nback in her chair thoughtfully, her reeds forgotten. Without warning, Solembum \\njumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap. He curled up, eyeing Eragon \\nhaughtily.\\nAngela petted \\nthe werecat. “Fascinating. Galbatorix allied with the Urgals, and Murtagh \\nfinally out in the open. . . . I’d warn you to be careful with Murtagh, but \\nyou’re obviously aware of the danger.”\\n“Murtagh has \\nbeen a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally,” said Eragon firmly.\\n“All the same, \\nbe careful.” Angela paused, then said distastefully, “And then there’s the \\nmatter of this Shade, Durza. I think he’s the greatest threat to the Varden \\nright now, aside from Galbatorix. Iloathe Shades—they practice the most \\nunholy magic, after necromancy. I’d like to dig his heart out with a dull \\nhairpin and feed it to a pig!”\\nEragon was \\nstartled by her sudden vehemence. “I don’t understand. Brom told me that Shades \\nwere sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will, but why does that \\nmake them so evil?”\\nAngela shook her \\nhead. “It doesn’t. Ordinary sorcerers are just that, ordinary—neither better \\nnor worse than the rest of us. They use their magical strength to control \\nspirits and the spirits’ powers. Shades, however, relinquish that control in \\ntheir search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlledby \\nspirits. Unfortunately, only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans, and \\nonce ensconced they never leave. Such possession can happen by accident if a \\nsorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself. The problem is, once a Shade \\nis created, it’s terribly difficult to kill. As I’m sure you know, only two \\npeople, Laetri the Elf and Irnstad the Rider, ever survived that feat.”\\n“I’ve heard the \\nstories.” Eragon gestured at the room. “Why are you living so high up in \\nTronjheim? Isn’t it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all \\nthis stuff up here?”\\nAngela threw \\nback her head and laughed wryly. “Truthfully? I’m in hiding. When I first came \\nto Tronjheim, I had a few days of peace—until one of guards who let me into \\nFarthen Dûr blabbed about who I was. Then all the magic users here, though theybarely \\nrate the term, pestered me to join their secret group. Especially those drajl \\nTwins who control it. Finally, I threatened to turn the lot of them into toads, \\nexcuse me, frogs, but when that didn’t deter them, I sneaked up here in the \\nmiddle of the night. It was less work than you might imagine, especially for \\none with my skills.”\\n“Did you have to \\nlet the Twins into your mind before you were allowed into Farthen Dûr?” asked \\nEragon. “I was forced to let them sift through my memories.”\\nA cold gleam \\nleapt into Angela’s eye. “The Twins wouldn’t dare probe me, for fear of what I \\nmight do to them. Oh, they’d love to, but they know the effort would leave them \\nbroken and gibbering nonsense. I’ve been coming here long before the Varden \\nbegan examining people’s minds . . . and they’re not about to start on me now.”\\nShe peered into \\nthe other room and said, “Well! This has been an enlightening talk, but I’m \\nafraid you have to go now. My brew of mandrake root and newt’s tongue is about \\nto boil, and it needs attending. Do come back again when you have the time. Andplease \\ndon’t tell anyone that I’m here. I’d hate to have to move again. It would make \\nme very . . .irritated. And you don’t want to see me irritated!”\\n“I’ll keep your \\nsecret,” assured Eragon, getting up.\\nSolembum jumped \\noff Angela’s lap as she stood. “Good!” she exclaimed.\\nEragon said \\nfarewell and left the room. Solembum guided him back to the dragonhold, then \\ndismissed him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away.\\nH ALL OF \\nTHE\\n \\nMOUNTAINKING\\nAdwarf was \\nwaiting for Eragon in the dragonhold. After bowing and muttering, “Argetlam,” \\nthe dwarf said with a thick accent, “Good. Awake. Knurla Orik waits for you.” \\nHe bowed again and scurried away. Saphira jumped out of her cave, landing next \\nto Eragon. Zar’roc was in her claws.\\nWhat’s that for?he asked, \\nfrowning.\\nShe tilted her \\nhead.Wear it. You are a Rider and should bear a Rider’s sword. Zar’roc may \\nhave a bloody history, but that should not shape your actions. Forge a new \\nhistory for it, and carry it with pride.\\nAre you \\nsure?Remember Ajihad’s counsel. \\nSaphira snorted, \\nand a puff of smoke rose from her nostrils.Wear it, Eragon. If you wish to \\nremain above the forces here, do not let anyone’s disapproval dictate your \\nactions.\\nAs you wish,he said \\nreluctantly, buckling on the sword. He clambered onto her back, and Saphira \\nflew out of Tronjheim. There was enough light in Farthen Dûr now that the hazy \\nmass of the crater walls—five miles away in each direction—was visible. While \\nthey spiraled down to the city-mountain’s base, Eragon told Saphira about his \\nmeeting with Angela.\\nAs soon as they \\nlanded by one of Tronjheim’s gates, Orik ran to Saphira’s side. “My king, \\nHrothgar, wishes to see both of you. Dismount quickly. We must hurry.”\\nEragon trotted \\nafter the dwarf into Tronjheim. Saphira easily kept pace beside them. Ignoring \\nstares from people within the soaring corridor, Eragon asked, “Where will we \\nmeet Hrothgar?”\\nWithout slowing, \\nOrik said, “In the throne room beneath the city. It will be a private audience \\nas an act of otho—of ‘faith.’ You do not have to address him in any special \\nmanner, but speak to him respectfully. Hrothgar is quick to anger, but he is \\nwise and sees keenly into the minds of men, so think carefully before you \\nspeak.”\\nOnce they \\nentered Tronjheim’s central chamber, Orik led the way to one of the two \\ndescending stairways that flanked the opposite hall. They started down the \\nright-hand staircase, which gently curved inward until it faced the direction \\nthey had come from. The other stairway merged with theirs to form a broad \\ncascade of dimly lit steps that ended, after a hundred feet, before two granite \\ndoors. A seven-pointed crown was carved across both doors.\\nSeven dwarves \\nstood guard on each side of the portal. They held burnished mattocks and wore \\ngem-encrusted belts. As Eragon, Orik, and Saphira approached, the dwarves \\npounded the floor with the mattocks’ hafts. A deep boom rolled back up the \\nstairs. The doors swung inward.\\nA dark hall lay \\nbefore them, a good bowshot long. The throne room was a natural cave; the walls \\nwere lined with stalagmites and stalactites, each thicker than a man. Sparsely \\nhung lanterns cast a moody light. The brown floor was smooth and polished. At \\nthe far end of the hall was a black throne with a motionless figure upon it.\\nOrik bowed. “The \\nking awaits you.” Eragon put his hand on Saphira’s side, and the two of them \\ncontinued forward. The doors closed behind them, leaving them alone in the dim \\nthrone room with the king.\\nTheir footsteps \\nechoed through the hall as they advanced toward the throne. In the recesses \\nbetween the stalagmites and stalactites rested large statues. Each sculpture \\ndepicted a dwarf king crowned and sitting on a throne; their sightless eyes \\ngazed sternly into the distance, their lined faces set in fierce expressions. A \\nname was chiseled in runes beneath each set of feet.\\nEragon and \\nSaphira strode solemnly between the two rows of long-dead monarchs. They passed \\nmore than forty statues, then only dark and empty alcoves awaiting future \\nkings. They stopped before Hrothgar at the end of the hall.\\nThe dwarf king \\nhimself sat like a statue upon a raised throne carved from a single piece of black \\nmarble. It was blocky, unadorned, and cut with unyielding precision. Strength \\nemanated from the throne, strength that harked back to ancient times when \\ndwarves had ruled in Alagaësia without opposition from elves or humans. A gold \\nhelm lined with rubies and diamonds rested on Hrothgar’s head in place of a \\ncrown. His visage was grim, weathered, and hewn of many years’ experience. \\nBeneath a craggy brow glinted deep-set eyes, flinty and piercing. Over his \\npowerful chest rippled a shirt of mail. His white beard was tucked under his \\nbelt, and in his lap he held a mighty war hammer with the symbol of Orik’s clan \\nembossed on its head.\\nEragon bowed \\nawkwardly and knelt. Saphira remained upright. The king stirred, as if \\nawakening from a long sleep, and rumbled, “Rise, Rider, you need not pay \\ntribute to me.”\\nStraightening, \\nEragon met Hrothgar’s impenetrable eyes. The king inspected him with a hard \\ngaze, then said gutturally, “Âz knurl deimi lanok.‘Beware, the rock \\nchanges’—an old dictum of ours. . . . And nowadays the rock changes very fast \\nindeed.” He fingered the war hammer. “I could not meet with you earlier, as \\nAjihad did, because I was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans. They \\ndemanded that I deny you sanctuary and expel you from Farthen Dûr. It has taken \\nmuch work on my part to convince them otherwise.”\\n“Thank you,” \\nsaid Eragon. “I didn’t anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause.”\\nThe king \\naccepted his thanks, then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed. “See there, Rider \\nEragon, where my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones. One and forty \\nthere are, with I the forty-second. When I pass from this world into the care \\nof the gods, my hírna will be added to their ranks. The first statue is the \\nlikeness of my ancestor Korgan, who forged this mace, Volund. For eight \\nmillennia—since the dawn of our race—dwarves have ruled under Farthen Dûr. We \\nare the bones of the land, older than both the fair elves and the savage \\ndragons.” Saphira shifted slightly.\\nHrothgar leaned \\nforward, his voice gravelly and deep. “I am old, human—even by our \\nreckoning—old enough to have seen the Riders in all their fleeting glory, old \\nenough to have spoken with their last leader, Vrael, who paid tribute to me \\nwithin these very walls. Few are still alive who can claim that much. I \\nremember the Riders and how they meddled in our affairs. I also remember the \\npeace they kept that made it possible to walk unharmed from Tronjheim to Narda.\\n“And now you \\nstand before me—a lost tradition revived. Tell me, and speak truly in this, why \\nhave you come to Farthen Dûr? I know of the events that made you flee the \\nEmpire, but what is your intent now?”\\n“For now, \\nSaphira and I merely want to recuperate in Tronjheim,” Eragon replied. “We are \\nnot here to cause trouble, only to find sanctuary from the dangers we’ve faced \\nfor many months. Ajihad may send us to the elves, but until he does, we have no \\nwish to leave.”\\n“Then was it \\nonly the desire for safety that drove you?” asked Hrothgar. “Do you just seek \\nto live here and forget your troubles with the Empire?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, his pride rejecting that statement. “If Ajihad told you of my past, you \\nshould know that I have grievances enough to fight the Empire until it is \\nnothing but scattered ashes. More than that, though . . . I want to aid those \\nwho cannot escape Galbatorix, including my cousin. I have the strength to help, \\nso I must.”\\nThe king seemed \\nsatisfied by his answer. He turned to Saphira and asked, “Dragon, what think \\nyou in this matter? For what reason have you come?”\\nSaphira lifted \\nthe edge of her lip to growl.Tell him that I thirst for the blood of our \\nenemies and eagerly await the day when we ride to battle against Galbatorix. \\nI’ve no love or mercy for traitors and egg breakers like that false king. He \\nheld me for over a century and, even now, still has two of my brethren, whom I \\nwould free if possible. And tell Hrothgar I think you ready for this task.\\nEragon grimaced \\nat her words, but dutifully relayed them. The corner of Hrothgar’s mouth lifted \\nin a hint of grim amusement, deepening his wrinkles. “I see that dragons have \\nnot changed with the centuries.” He rapped the throne with a knuckle. “Do you \\nknow why this seat was quarried so flat and angular? So that no one would sit comfortably \\non it. I have not, and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes. \\nWhat is there to remind you of your obligations, Eragon? If the Empire falls, \\nwill you take Galbatorix’s place and claim his kingship?”\\n“I don’t seek to \\nwear the crown or rule,” said Eragon, troubled. “Being a Rider is \\nresponsibility enough. No, I would not take the throne in Urû’baen . . . not \\nunless there was no one else willing or competent enough to take it.”\\nHrothgar warned \\ngravely, “Certainly you would be a kinder king than Galbatorix, but no race \\nshould have a leader who does not age or leave the throne. The time of the \\nRiders has passed, Eragon. They will never rise again—not even if Galbatorix’s \\nother eggs were to hatch.”\\nA shadow crossed \\nhis face as he gazed at Eragon’s side. “I see that you carry an enemy’s sword; \\nI was told of this, and that you travel with a son of the Forsworn. It does not \\nplease me to see this weapon.” He extended a hand. “I would like to examine \\nit.”\\nEragon drew \\nZar’roc and presented it to the king, hilt first. Hrothgar grasped the sword \\nand ran a practiced eye over the red blade. The edge caught the lantern light, \\nreflecting it sharply. The dwarf king tested the point with his palm, then \\nsaid, “A masterfully forged blade. Elves rarely choose to make swords—they \\nprefer bows and spears—but when they do, the results are unmatched. This is an \\nill-fated blade; I am not glad to see it within my realm. But carry it if you \\nwill; perhaps its luck has changed.” He returned Zar’roc, and Eragon sheathed \\nit. “Has my nephew proved helpful during your time here?”\\n“Who?”\\nHrothgar raised \\na tangled eyebrow. “Orik, my youngest sister’s son. He’s been serving under \\nAjihad to show my support for the Varden. It seems that he has been returned to \\nmy command, however. I was gratified to hear that you defended him with your \\nwords.”\\nEragon \\nunderstood that this was another sign of otho, of “faith,” on Hrothgar’s part. \\n“I couldn’t ask for a better guide.”\\n“That is good,” \\nsaid the king, clearly pleased. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak with you much \\nlonger. My advisors wait for me, as there are matters I must deal with. I will \\nsay this, though: If you wish the support of the dwarves within my realm, you \\nmust first prove yourself to them. We have long memories and do not rush to \\nhasty decisions. Words will decide nothing, only deeds.”\\n“I will keep \\nthat in mind,” said Eragon, bowing again.\\nHrothgar nodded \\nregally. “You may go, then.”\\nEragon turned \\nwith Saphira, and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king. Orik was \\nwaiting for them on the other side of the stone doors, an anxious expression on \\nhis face. He fell in with them as they climbed back up to Tronjheim’s main \\nchamber. “Did all go well? Were you received favorably?”\\n“I think so. But \\nyour king is cautious,” said Eragon.\\n“That is how he \\nhas survived this long.”\\nI would not want \\nHrothgar angry at us,observed \\nSaphira.\\nEragon glanced \\nat her.No, I wouldn’t either. I’m not sure what he thought of you—he seems \\nto disapprove of dragons, though he didn’t say it outright.\\nThat seemed to \\namuse Saphira.In that he is wise, especially since he’s barely knee-high to \\nme.\\nIn Tronjheim’s \\ncenter, under the sparkling Isidar Mithrim, Orik said, “Your blessing yesterday \\nhas stirred up the Varden like an overturned beehive. The child Saphira touched \\nhas been hailed as a future hero. She and her guardian have been quartered in \\nthe finest rooms. Everyone is talking about your ‘miracle.’ All the human \\nmothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children.”\\nAlarmed, Eragon \\nfurtively looked around. “What should we do?”\\n“Aside from \\ntaking back your actions?” asked Orik dryly. “Stay out of sight as much as \\npossible. Everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold, so you won’t be \\ndisturbed there.”\\nEragon did not \\nwant to return to the dragonhold yet. It was early in the day, and he wanted to \\nexplore Tronjheim with Saphira. Now that they were out of the Empire, there was \\nno reason for them to be apart. But he wanted to avoid attention, which would \\nbe impossible with her at his side.Saphira, what do you want to do?\\nShe nosed him, \\nscales brushing his arm.I’ll return to the dragonhold. There’s someone there \\nI want to meet. Wander around as long as you like.\\nAll right,he said,but \\nwho do you want to meet? Saphira only winked a large eye at him before \\npadding down one of Tronjheim’s four main tunnels.\\nEragon explained \\nto Orik where she was going, then said, “I’d like some breakfast. And then I’d \\nlike to see more of Tronjheim; it’s such an incredible place. I don’t want to \\ngo to the training grounds until tomorrow, as I’m still not fully recovered.”\\nOrik nodded, his \\nbeard bobbing on his chest. “In that case, would you like to visit Tronjheim’s \\nlibrary? It’s quite old and contains many scrolls of great value. You might \\nfind it interesting to read a history of Alagaësia that hasn’t been tainted by \\nGalbatorix’s hand.”\\nWith a pang, \\nEragon remembered how Brom had taught him to read. He wondered if he still had \\nthe skill. A long time had passed since he had seen any written words. “Yes, \\nlet’s do that.”\\n“Very well.”\\nAfter they ate, \\nOrik guided Eragon through myriad corridors to their destination. When they \\nreached the library’s carved arch, Eragon stepped through it reverently.\\nThe room \\nreminded him of a forest. Rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark, \\nribbed ceiling five stories above. Between the pillars, black-marble bookcases \\nstood back to back. Racks of scrolls covered the walls, interspersed with \\nnarrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases. Placed at regular \\nintervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches. Between them \\nwere small tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor.\\nCountless books \\nand scrolls were stored in the room. “This is the true legacy of our race,” \\nsaid Orik. “Here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars, from \\nantiquity to the present. Also recorded are the songs and stories composed by \\nour artisans. This library may be our most precious possession. It isn’t all \\nour work, though—there are human writings here as well. Yours is a \\nshort-lived—but prolific—race. We have little or nothing of the elves’. They \\nguard their secrets jealously.”\\n“How long may I \\nstay?” asked Eragon, moving toward the shelves.\\n“As long as you \\nwant. Come to me if you have any questions.”\\nEragon browsed \\nthrough the volumes with delight, reaching eagerly for those with interesting \\ntitles or covers. Surprisingly, dwarves used the same runes to write as humans. \\nHe was somewhat disheartened by how hard reading was after months of neglect. \\nHe skipped from book to book, slowly working his way deep into the vast \\nlibrary. Eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by Dóndar, the \\ntenth dwarf king.\\nAs he scanned \\nthe graceful lines, unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase. \\nThe sound startled him, but he berated himself for being silly—he could not be \\nthe only person in the library. Even so, he quietly replaced the book and \\nslipped away, senses alert for danger. He had been ambushed too many times to \\nignore such feelings. He heard the footsteps again; only now there were two \\nsets of them. Apprehensive, he darted across an opening, trying to remember \\nexactly where Orik was sitting. He sidestepped around a corner and started as \\nhe found himself face to face with the Twins.\\nThe Twins stood \\ntogether, their shoulders meeting, a blank expression on their smooth faces. \\nTheir black snake eyes bored into him. Their hands, hidden within the folds of \\ntheir purple robes, twitched slightly. They both bowed, but the movement was \\ninsolent and derisive.\\n“We have been \\nsearching for you,” one said. His voice was uncomfortably like the Ra’zac’s.\\nEragon \\nsuppressed a shiver. “What for?” He reached out with his mind and contacted \\nSaphira. She immediately joined thoughts with him.\\n“Ever since you \\nmet with Ajihad, we have wanted to . . . apologize for our actions.” The words \\nwere mocking, but not in a way Eragon could challenge. “We have come to pay \\nhomage to you.” Eragon flushed angrily as they bowed again.\\nCareful!warned Saphira.\\nHe pushed back \\nhis rising temper. He could not afford to be riled by this confrontation. An \\nidea came to him, and he said with a small smile, “Nay, it is I who pay homage \\nto you. Without your approval I never could have gained entrance to Farthen \\nDûr.” He bowed to them in turn, making the movement as insulting as he could.\\nThere was a \\nflicker of irritation in the Twins’ eyes, but they smiled and said, “We are \\nhonored that one so . . . important . . . as yourself thinks so highly of us. \\nWe are in your debt for your kind words.”\\nNow it was \\nEragon’s turn to be irritated. “I will remember that when I’m in need.”\\nSaphira intruded \\nsharply in his thoughts.You’re overdoing it.Don’t say anything you’ll \\nregret. They will remember every word they can use against you.\\nThis is \\ndifficult enough without you making comments!he snapped. She subsided with an \\nexasperated grumble.\\nThe Twins moved \\ncloser, the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor. Their voices \\nbecame more pleasant. “We have searched for you for another reason as well, \\nRider. The few magic users who live in Tronjheim have formed a group. We call \\nourselves Du Vrangr Gata, or the—”\\n“The Wandering \\nPath, I know,” interrupted Eragon, remembering what Angela had said about it.\\n“Your knowledge \\nof the ancient language is impressive,” said a Twin smoothly. “As we were \\nsaying, Du Vrangr Gata has heard of your mighty feats, and we have come to \\nextend an invitation of membership. We would be honored to have one of your \\nstature as a member. And I suspect that we might be able to assist you as \\nwell.”\\n“How?”\\nThe other Twin \\nsaid, “The two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters. We could \\nguide you . . . show you spells we’ve discovered and teach you words of power. \\nNothing would gladden us more than if we could assist, in some small way, your \\npath to glory. No repayment would be necessary, though if you saw fit to share \\nsome scraps of your own knowledge, we would be satisfied.”\\nEragon’s face \\nhardened as he realized what they were asking for. “Do you think I’m a half-wit?” \\nhe demanded harshly. “I won’t apprentice myself to you so you can learn the \\nwords Brom taught me! It must have angered you when you couldn’t steal them \\nfrom my mind.”\\nThe Twins \\nabruptly dropped their facade of smiles. “We are not to be trifled with, boy! \\nWe are the ones who will test your abilities with magic. And that could bemost \\nunpleasant. Remember, it only takes one misconceived spell to kill someone. You \\nmay be a Rider, but the two of us are still stronger than you.”\\nEragon kept his \\nface expressionless, even as his stomach knotted painfully. “I will consider \\nyour offer, but it may—”\\n“Then we will \\nexpect your answer tomorrow. Make sure that it is the right one.” They smiled \\ncoldly and stalked deeper into the library.\\nEragon scowled.I’m \\nnot going to join Du Vrangr Gata, no matter what they do.\\nYou should talk \\nto Angela,said \\nSaphira.She’s dealt with the Twins before. Perhaps she could be there when \\nthey test you. That might prevent them from harming you.\\nThat’s a good \\nidea.Eragon \\nwound through the bookcases until he found Orik sitting on a bench, busily \\npolishing his war ax. “I’d like to return to the dragonhold.”\\nThe dwarf slid \\nthe haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt, then escorted Eragon to \\nthe gate where Saphira waited. People had already gathered around her. Ignoring \\nthem, Eragon scrambled onto Saphira’s back, and they escaped to the sky.\\nThis problem \\nmust be resolved quickly. You cannot let the Twins intimidate you,Saphira said as \\nshe landed on Isidar Mithrim.\\nI know. But I \\nhope we can avoid angering them.They could be dangerous enemies.He dismounted \\nquickly, keeping a hand on Zar’roc.\\nSo can you. Do \\nyou want them as allies? \\nHe shook his \\nhead.Not really . . . I’ll tell them tomorrow that I won’t join Du Vrangr \\nGata.\\nEragon left \\nSaphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold. He wanted to see \\nAngela, but he didn’t remember how to find her hiding place, and Solembum was \\nnot there to guide him. He roamed the deserted corridors, hoping to meet Angela \\nby chance.\\nWhen he grew \\ntired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls, he retraced his \\nfootsteps to the hold. As he neared it, he heard someone speaking within the \\nroom. He halted and listened, but the clear voice fell silent.Saphira?Who’s \\nin there?\\nA female . . . \\nShe has an air of command. I’ll distract her while you come in.Eragon loosened \\nZar’roc in its sheath.Orik said that intruders would be kept out of the \\ndragonhold, so who could this be? He steadied his nerves, then stepped into \\nthe hold, his hand on the sword.\\nA young woman \\nstood in the center of the room, looking curiously at Saphira, who had stuck \\nher head out of the cave. The woman appeared to be about seventeen years old. \\nThe star sapphire cast a rosy light on her, accentuating skin the same deep \\nshade as Ajihad’s. Her velvet dress was wine red and elegantly cut. A jeweled \\ndagger, worn with use, hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath.\\nEragon crossed \\nhis arms, waiting for the woman to notice him. She continued to look at \\nSaphira, then curtsied and asked sweetly, “Please, could you tell me where \\nRider Eragon is?” Saphira’s eyes sparkled with amusement.\\nWith a small \\nsmile, Eragon said, “I am here.”\\nThe woman \\nwhirled to face him, hand flying to her dagger. Her face was striking, with \\nalmond-shaped eyes, wide lips, and round cheekbones. She relaxed and curtsied \\nagain. “I am Nasuada,” she said.\\nEragon inclined \\nhis head. “You obviously know who I am, but what do you want?”\\nNasuada smiled \\ncharmingly. “My father, Ajihad, sent me here with a message. Would you like to \\nhear it?”\\nThe Varden’s \\nleader had not struck Eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood. He \\nwondered who Nasuada’s mother was—she must have been an uncommon woman to have \\nattracted Ajihad’s eye. “Yes, I would.”\\nNasuada tossed \\nher hair back and recited: “He is pleased that you are doing well, but he \\ncautions you against actions like your benediction yesterday. They create more \\nproblems than they solve. Also, he urges you to proceed with the testing as \\nsoon as possible—he needs to know how capable you are before he communicates \\nwith the elves.”\\n“Did you climb \\nall the way up here just to tell me that?” Eragon asked, thinking of Vol \\nTurin’s length.\\nNasuada shook \\nher head. “I used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels. \\nWe could have sent the message with signals, but I decided to bring it myself \\nand meet you in person.”\\n“Would you like \\nto sit down?” asked Eragon. He motioned toward Saphira’s cave.\\nNasuada laughed \\nlightly. “No, I am expected elsewhere. You should also know, my father decreed \\nthat you may visit Murtagh, if you wish.” A somber expression disturbed her \\npreviously smooth features. “I met Murtagh earlier. . . . He’s anxious to speak \\nwith you. He seemed lonely; you should visit him.” She gave Eragon directions \\nto Murtagh’s cell.\\nEragon thanked \\nher for the news, then asked, “What about Arya? Is she better? Can I see her? \\nOrik wasn’t able to tell me much.”\\nShe smiled \\nmischievously. “Arya is recovering swiftly, as all elves do. No one is allowed \\nto see her except my father, Hrothgar, and the healers. They have spent much \\ntime with her, learning all that occurred during her imprisonment.” She swept \\nher eyes over Saphira. “I must go now. Is there anything you would have me \\nconvey to Ajihad on your behalf?”\\n“No, except a \\ndesire to visit Arya. And give him my thanks for the hospitality he’s shown \\nus.”\\n“I will take \\nyour words directly to him. Farewell, Rider Eragon. I hope we shall soon meet \\nagain.” She curtsied and exited the dragonhold, head held high.\\nIf she really came \\nall the way up Tronjheim just to meet me—pulleys or no pulleys—there was more \\nto this meeting than idle chatter,remarked Eragon.\\nAye,said Saphira, \\nwithdrawing her head into the cave. Eragon climbed up to her and was surprised \\nto see Solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck. The werecat \\nwas purring deeply, his black-tipped tail flicking back and forth. The two of \\nthem looked at Eragon impudently, as if to ask, “What?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, laughing helplessly.Saphira, is Solembum who you wanted to meet?\\nThey both \\nblinked at him and answered,Yes.\\nJust wondering,he said, mirth \\nstill bubbling inside him. It made sense that they would befriend each \\nother—their personalities were similar, and they were both creatures of magic. \\nHe sighed, releasing some of the day’s tension as he unbuckled Zar’roc.Solembum, \\ndo you know where Angela is? I couldn’t find her, and I need her advice.\\nSolembum kneaded \\nhis paws against Saphira’s scaled back.She is somewhere in Tronjheim.\\nWhen will she \\nreturn?\\n\\nSoon. \\nHow soon?he asked \\nimpatiently.I need to talk to her today.\\nNot that soon. \\nThe werecat \\nrefused to say more, despite Eragon’s persistent questions. He gave up and \\nnestled against Saphira. Solembum’s purring was a low thrum above his head.I \\nhave to visit Murtagh tomorrow, he thought, fingering Brom’s ring.\\nA RYA’STEST\\nOn the morning of \\ntheir third day in Tronjheim, Eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized. \\nHe belted Zar’roc to his waist and slung his bow and half-full quiver across \\nhis back. After a leisurely flight inside Farthen Dûr with Saphira, he met Orik \\nby one of Tronjheim’s four main gates. Eragon asked him about Nasuada.\\n“An unusual \\ngirl,” answered Orik, glancing disapprovingly at Zar’roc. “She’s totally \\ndevoted to her father and spends all her time helping him. I think she does \\nmore for Ajihad than he knows—there have been times when she’s maneuvered his \\nenemies without ever revealing her part in it.”\\n“Who is her \\nmother?”\\n“That I don’t \\nknow. Ajihad was alone when he brought Nasuada to Farthen Dûr as a newborn \\nchild. He’s never said where he and Nasuada came from.”\\nSo she too grew \\nup without knowing her mother.He shook off the thought. “I’m restless. \\nIt’ll be good to use my muscles. Where should I go for this ‘testing’ of \\nAjihad’s?”\\nOrik pointed out \\ninto Farthen Dûr. “The training field is half a mile from Tronjheim, though you \\ncan’t see it from here because it’s behind the city-mountain. It’s a large area \\nwhere both dwarves and humans practice.”\\nI’m coming as \\nwell,stated \\nSaphira.\\nEragon told \\nOrik, and the dwarf tugged on his beard. “That might not be a good idea. There \\nare many people at the training field; you will be sure to attract attention.”\\nSaphira growled \\nloudly.I will come! And that settled the matter.\\n\\xa0\\nThe unruly \\nclatter of fighting reached them from the field: the loud clang of steel \\nclashing on steel, the solid thump of arrows striking padded targets, the \\nrattle and crack of wooden staves, and the shouts of men in mock battle. The \\nnoise was confusing, yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern.\\nThe bulk of the \\ntraining ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling \\nwith shields and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves. They drilled as a group \\nin formations. Practicing beside them were hundreds of individual warriors \\noutfitted with swords, maces, spears, staves, flails, shields of all shapes and \\nsizes, and even, Eragon saw, someone with a pitchfork. Nearly all the fighters \\nwore armor, usually chain mail and a helmet; plate armor was not as common. \\nThere were as many dwarves as humans, though the two kept mainly to themselves. \\nBehind the sparring warriors, a broad line of archers fired steadily at gray \\nsackcloth dummies.\\nBefore Eragon \\nhad time to wonder what he was supposed to do, a bearded man, his head and \\nblocky shoulders covered by a mail coif, strode over to them. The rest of him \\nwas protected by a rough oxhide suit that still had hair on it. A huge \\nsword—almost as long as Eragon—hung across his broad back. He ran a quick eye \\nover Saphira and Eragon, as if evaluating how dangerous they were, then said \\ngruffly, “Knurla Orik. You’ve been gone too long. There’s nobody left for me to \\nspar with.”\\nOrik smiled. \\n“Oeí, that’s because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster \\nsword.”\\n“Everyone except \\nyou,” he corrected.\\n“That’s because \\nI’m faster than a giant like you.”\\nThe man looked \\nat Eragon again. “I’m Fredric. I’ve been told to find out what you can do. How \\nstrong are you?”\\n“Strong enough,” \\nanswered Eragon. “I have to be in order to fight with magic.”\\nFredric shook \\nhis head; the coif clinked like a bag of coins. “Magic has no place in what we \\ndo here. Unless you’ve served in an army, I doubt any fights you’ve been in \\nlasted more than a few minutes. What we’re concerned about is how you’ll be \\nable to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours, or even weeks if it’s a \\nsiege. Do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow?”\\nEragon thought \\nabout it. “Only my fists.”\\n“Good answer!” \\nlaughed Fredric. “Well, we’ll start you off with the bow and see how you do. \\nThen once some space has cleared up on the field, we’ll try—” He broke off \\nsuddenly and stared past Eragon, scowling angrily.\\nThe Twins \\nstalked toward them, their bald heads pale against their purple robes. Orik \\nmuttered something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his \\nbelt. “I told you two to stay away from the training area,” said Fredric, \\nstepping forward threateningly. The Twins seemed frail before his bulk.\\nThey looked at \\nhim arrogantly. “We were ordered by Ajihad to test Eragon’s proficiency with \\nmagic—beforeyou exhaust him banging on pieces of metal.”\\nFredric \\nglowered. “Why can’t someone else test him?”\\n“No one else is \\npowerful enough,” sniffed the Twins. Saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them. \\nA line of smoke trickled from her nostrils, but they ignored her. “Come with \\nus,” they ordered, and strode to an empty corner of the field.\\nShrugging, \\nEragon followed with Saphira. Behind him he heard Fredric say to Orik, “We have \\nto stop them from going too far.”\\n“I know,” \\nanswered Orik in a low voice, “but I can’t interfere again. Hrothgar made it \\nclear he won’t be able to protect me the next time it happens.”\\nEragon forced \\nback his growing apprehension. The Twins might know more techniques and words. \\n. . . Still, he remembered what Brom had told him: Riders were stronger in \\nmagic than ordinary men. But would that be enough to resist the combined power \\nof the Twins?\\nDon’t worry so \\nmuch; I will help you,said Saphira.There are two of us as well.\\nHe touched her \\ngently on the leg, relieved by her words. The Twins looked at Eragon and asked, \\n“And how do you answer us, Eragon?”\\nOverlooking the \\npuzzled expressions of his companions, he said flatly, “No.”\\nSharp lines \\nappeared at the corners of the Twins’ mouths. They turned so they faced Eragon \\nobliquely and, bending at the waists, drew a large pentagram on the ground. \\nThey stepped in the middle of it, then said harshly, “We begin now. You will \\nattempt to complete the tasks we assign you . . . that is all.”\\nOne of the Twins \\nreached into his robe, produced a polished rock the size of Eragon’s fist, and \\nset it on the ground. “Lift it to eye level.”\\nThat’s easy \\nenough,commented \\nEragon to Saphira. “Stenr reisa!” The rock wobbled, then smoothly rose from the \\nground. Before it went more than a foot, an unexpected resistance halted it in \\nmidair. A smile touched the Twins’ lips. Eragon stared at them, enraged—they \\nwere trying to make him fail! If he became exhausted now, it would be \\nimpossible to complete the harder tasks. Obviously they were confident that \\ntheir combined strength could easily wear him down.\\nBut I’m not \\nalone either,snarled \\nEragon to himself.Saphira, now! Her mind melded with his, and the rock \\njerked through the air to stop, quivering, at eye level. The Twins’ eyes \\nnarrowed cruelly.\\n“Very . . . \\ngood,” they hissed. Fredric looked unnerved by the display of magic. “Now move \\nthe stone in a circle.” Again Eragon struggled against their efforts to stop \\nhim, and again—to their obvious anger—he prevailed. The exercises quickly \\nincreased in complexity and difficulty until Eragon was forced to think \\ncarefully about which words to use. And each time, the Twins fought him \\nbitterly, though the strain never showed on their faces.\\nIt was only with \\nSaphira’s support that Eragon was able to hold his ground. In a break between \\ntwo of the tasks, he asked her,Why do they continue this testing? Our \\nabilities were clear enough from what they saw in my mind. She cocked her \\nhead thoughtfully.You know what? he said grimly as comprehension came to \\nhim.They’re using this as an opportunity to figure out what ancient words I \\nknow and perhaps learn new ones themselves.\\nSpeak softly \\nthen, so that they cannot hear you, and use the simplest words possible. \\nFrom then on, \\nEragon used only a handful of basic words to complete the tasks. But finding \\nways to make them perform in the same manner as a long sentence or phrase stretched \\nhis ingenuity to the limit. He was rewarded by the frustration that contorted \\nthe Twins’ faces as he foiled them again and again. No matter what they tried, \\nthey could not get him to use any more words in the ancient language.\\nMore than an \\nhour passed, but the Twins showed no sign of stopping. Eragon was hot and \\nthirsty, but refrained from asking for a reprieve—he would continue as long as \\nthey did. There were many tests: manipulating water, casting fire, scrying, \\njuggling rocks, hardening leather, freezing items, controlling the flight of an \\narrow, and healing scratches. He wondered how long it would take for the Twins \\nto run out of ideas.\\nFinally the \\nTwins raised their hands and said, “There is only one thing left to do. It is \\nsimple enough—anycompetent user of magic should find this easy.” One of \\nthem removed a silver ring from his finger and smugly handed it to Eragon. \\n“Summon the essence of silver.”\\nEragon stared at \\nthe ring in confusion. What was he supposed to do? The essence of silver, what \\nwas that? And how was it to be summoned? Saphira had no idea, and the Twins \\nwere not going to help. He had never learned silver’s name in the ancient \\nlanguage, though he knew it had to be part ofargetlam. In desperation he \\ncombined the only word that might work,ethgrí, or “invoke,” witharget.\\nDrawing himself \\nupright, he gathered together what power he had left and parted his lips to \\ndeliver the invocation. Suddenly a clear, vibrant voice split the air.\\n“Stop!”\\nThe word rushed \\nover Eragon like cool water—the voice was strangely familiar, like a \\nhalf-remembered melody. The back of his neck tingled. He slowly turned toward \\nits source.\\nA lone figure \\nstood behind them: Arya. A leather strip encircled her brow, restraining her \\nvoluminous black hair, which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous \\ncascade. Her slender sword was at her hip, her bow on her back. Plain black \\nleather clothed her shapely frame, poor raiment for one so fair. She was taller \\nthan most men, and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed. An unmarked \\nface reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured.\\nArya’s blazing \\nemerald eyes were fixed on the Twins, who had turned pale with fright. She \\napproached on silent footsteps and said in soft, menacing tones, “Shame! Shame \\nto ask of him what only a master can do. Shame that you should use such \\nmethods. Shame that you told Ajihad you didn’t know Eragon’s abilities. He is \\ncompetent. Now leave!” Arya frowned dangerously, her slanted eyebrows meeting \\nlike lightning bolts in a sharp V, and pointed at the ring in Eragon’s hand. \\n“Arget!” she exclaimed thunderously.\\nThe silver \\nshimmered, and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it. The two \\nwere identical except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed white-hot. At \\nthe sight of it, the Twins spun on their heels and fled, robes flapping wildly. \\nThe insubstantial ring vanished from Eragon’s hand, leaving the circlet of \\nsilver behind. Orik and Fredric were on their feet, eyeing Arya warily. Saphira \\ncrouched, ready for action.\\nThe elf surveyed \\nthem all. Her angled eyes paused on Eragon. Then she turned and strode toward \\nthe heart of the training field. The warriors ceased their sparring and looked \\nat her with wonder. Within a few moments the entire field fell silent in awe of \\nher presence.\\nEragon was \\ninexorably dragged forward by his own fascination. Saphira spoke, but he was \\noblivious to her comments. A large circle formed around Arya. Looking only at \\nEragon, she proclaimed, “I claim the right of trial by arms. Draw your sword.”\\nShe means to \\nduel me!\\n\\nBut not, I \\nthink, to harm you,replied \\nSaphira slowly. She nudged him with her nose.Go and acquit yourself well. I \\nwill watch.\\nEragon \\nreluctantly stepped forward. He did not want to do this when he was exhausted \\nfrom magic use and when there were so many people watching. Besides, Arya could \\nbe in no shape for sparring. It had only been two days since she had received \\nTúnivor’s Nectar.I will soften my blows so I don’t hurt her, he decided.\\nThey faced each \\nother across the circle of warriors. Arya drew her sword with her left hand. \\nThe weapon was thinner than Eragon’s, but just as long and sharp. He slid \\nZar’roc out of its polished sheath and held the red blade point-down by his \\nside. For a long moment they stood motionless, elf and human watching each \\nother. It flashed through Eragon’s mind that this was how many of his fights \\nwith Brom had started.\\nHe moved forward \\ncautiously. With a blur of motion Arya jumped at him, slashing at his ribs. \\nEragon reflexively parried the attack, and their swords met in a shower of \\nsparks. Zar’roc was batted aside as if it were no more than a fly. The elf did \\nnot take advantage of the opening, however, but spun to her right, hair \\nwhipping through the air, and struck at his other side. He barely stopped the blow \\nand backpedaled frantically, stunned by her ferocity and speed.\\nBelatedly, \\nEragon remembered Brom’s warning that even the weakest elf could easily \\noverpower a human. He had about as much chance of defeating Arya as he did \\nDurza. She attacked again, swinging at his head. He ducked under the \\nrazor-sharp edge. But then why was she . . .toying with him? For a few \\nlong seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it, then he \\nrealized,She wants to know how proficient I am.\\nUnderstanding \\nthat, he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew. He flowed from \\none pose to another, recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible \\nway. But no matter how inventive he was, Arya’s sword always stopped his. She \\nmatched his actions with effortless grace.\\nEngaged in a \\nfiery dance, their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades. At \\ntimes they nearly touched, taut skin only a hair’s breadth away, but then \\nmomentum would whirl them apart, and they would withdraw for a second, only to \\njoin again. Their sinuous forms wove together like twisting ropes of windblown \\nsmoke.\\nEragon could \\nnever remember how long they fought. It was timeless, filled with nothing but \\naction and reaction. Zar’roc grew leaden in his hand; his arm burned \\nferociously with each stroke. At last, as he lunged forward, Arya nimbly \\nsidestepped, sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with \\nsupernatural speed.\\nEragon froze as \\nthe icy metal touched his skin. His muscles trembled from the exertion. Dimly \\nhe heard Saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them. Arya \\nlowered her sword and sheathed it. “You have passed,” she said quietly amid the \\nnoise.\\nDazed, he slowly \\nstraightened. Fredric was beside him now, thumping his back enthusiastically. \\n“That was incredible swordsmanship! I even learned some new moves from watching \\nthe two of you. And the elf—stunning!”\\nBut I lost,he protested \\nsilently. Orik praised his performance with a broad smile, but all Eragon \\nnoticed was Arya, standing alone and silent. She motioned slightly with a \\nfinger, no more than a twitch, toward a knoll about a mile from the practice \\nfield, then turned and walked away. The crowd melted before her. A hush fell \\nover the men and dwarves as she passed.\\nEragon turned to \\nOrik. “I have to go. I’ll return to the dragonhold soon.” With a swift jab, \\nEragon sheathed Zar’roc and pulled himself onto Saphira. She took off over the \\ntraining field, which turned into a sea of faces as everyone looked at her.\\nAs they soared \\ntoward the knoll, Eragon saw Arya running below them with clean, easy strides. \\nSaphira commented,You find her form pleasing, do you not?\\nYes,he admitted, \\nblushing.\\nHer face does \\nhave more character than that of most humans,she sniffed.But it’s long, \\nlike a horse’s, and overall she’s rather shapeless.\\nEragon looked at \\nSaphira with amazement.You’re jealous, aren’t you!\\nImpossible. I \\nnever get jealous,she \\nsaid, offended.\\nYou are now, \\nadmit it!he \\nlaughed.\\nShe snapped her \\njaws together loudly.I am not! He smiled and shook his head, but let her \\ndenial stand. She landed heavily on the knoll, jostling him roughly. He jumped \\ndown without remarking on it.\\nArya was close \\nbehind them. Her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner Eragon had \\nseen. When she reached the top of the knoll, her breathing was smooth and \\nregular. Suddenly tongue-tied, Eragon dropped his gaze. She strode past him and \\nsaid to Saphira, “Skulblaka, eka celöbra ono un mulabra ono un onr Shur’tugal \\nné haina. Atra nosu waíse fricai.”\\nEragon did not \\nrecognize most of the words, but Saphira obviously understood the message. She \\nshuffled her wings and surveyed Arya curiously. Then she nodded, humming \\ndeeply. Arya smiled. “I am glad that you recovered,” Eragon said. “We didn’t \\nknow if you would live or not.”\\n“That is why I \\ncame here today,” said Arya, facing him. Her rich voice was accented and \\nexotic. She spoke clearly, with a hint of trill, as if she were about to sing. \\n“I owe you a debt that must be repaid. You saved my life. That can never be \\nforgotten.”\\n“It—it was \\nnothing,” said Eragon, fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true, \\neven as he spoke them. Embarrassed, he changed the subject. “How did you come \\nto be in Gil’ead?”\\nPain shadowed \\nArya’s face. She looked away into the distance. “Let us walk.” They descended from \\nthe knoll and meandered toward Farthen Dûr. Eragon respected Arya’s silence as \\nthey walked. Saphira padded quietly beside them. Finally Arya lifted her head \\nand said with the grace of her kind, “Ajihad told me you were present when \\nSaphira’s egg appeared.”\\n“Yes.” For the \\nfirst time, Eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the \\negg over the dozens of leagues that separated Du Weldenvarden from the Spine. \\nTo even attempt such a feat was courting disaster, if not death.\\nHer next words \\nwere heavy. “Then know this: at the moment you first beheld it, I was captured \\nby Durza.” Her voice filled with bitterness and grief. “It was he who led the \\nUrgals that ambushed and slew my companions, Faolin and Glenwing. Somehow he \\nknew where to wait for us—we had no warning. I was drugged and transported to \\nGil’ead. There, Durza was charged by Galbatorix to learn where I had sent the \\negg and all I knew of Ellesméra.”\\nShe stared ahead \\nicily, jaw clenched. “He tried for months without success. His methods were . . \\n. harsh. When torture failed, he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would. \\nFortunately, I still had the strength to nudge their minds and make them \\nincapable. At last Galbatorix ordered that I was to be brought to Urû’baen. \\nDread filled me when I learned this, as I was weary in both mind and body and \\nhad no strength to resist him. If it were not for you, I would have stood \\nbefore Galbatorix in a week’s time.”\\nEragon shuddered \\ninwardly. It was amazing what she had survived. The memory of her injuries was \\nstill vivid in his mind. Softly, he asked, “Why do you tell me all this?”\\n“So that you \\nknow what I was saved from. Do not presume I can ignore your deed.”\\nHumbled, he \\nbowed his head. “What will you do now—return to Ellesméra?”\\n“No, not yet. \\nThere is much that must be done here. I cannot abandon the Varden—Ajihad needs \\nmy help. I’ve seen you tested in both arms and magic today. Brom taught you \\nwell. You are ready to proceed in your training.”\\n“You mean for me \\nto go to Ellesméra?”\\n“Yes.”\\nEragon felt a \\nflash of irritation. Did he and Saphira have no say in the matter? “When?”\\n“That is yet to \\nbe decided, but not for some weeks.”\\nAt least they \\ngave us that much time,thought Eragon. Saphira mentioned something to him, \\nand he in turn asked Arya, “What did the Twins want me to do?”\\nArya’s sculpted \\nlip curled with disgust. “Something not even they can accomplish. It is \\npossible to speak the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its \\ntrue form. It takes years of work and great discipline, but the reward is \\ncomplete control over the object. That is why one’s true name is always kept \\nhidden, for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts, they could \\ndominate you utterly.”\\n“It’s strange,” \\nsaid Eragon after a moment, “but before I was captured at Gil’ead, I had \\nvisions of you in my dreams. It was like scrying—and I was able to scry you \\nlater—but it was always during my sleep.”\\nArya pursed her \\nlips pensively. “There were times I felt as if another presence was watching \\nme, but I was often confused and feverish. I’ve never heard of anyone, either \\nin lore or legend, being able to scry in their sleep.”\\n“I don’t \\nunderstand it myself,” said Eragon, looking at his hands. He twirled Brom’s \\nring around his finger. “What does the tattoo on your shoulder mean? I didn’t \\nmean to see it, but when I was healing your wounds . . . it couldn’t be helped. \\nIt’s just like the symbol on this ring.”\\n“You have a ring \\nwith the yawë on it?” she asked sharply.\\n“Yes. It was \\nBrom’s. See?”\\nHe held out the \\nring. Arya examined the sapphire, then said, “This is a token given only to the \\nmost valued elf-friends—so valued, in fact, it has not been used in centuries. \\nOr so I thought. I never knew that Queen Islanzadi thought so highly of Brom.”\\n“I shouldn’t \\nwear it, then,” said Eragon, afraid that he had been presumptuous.\\n“No, keep it. It \\nwill give you protection if you meet my people by chance, and it may help you \\ngain favor with the queen. Tell no one of my tattoo. It should not be \\nrevealed.”\\n“Very well.”\\n\\xa0\\nHe enjoyed \\ntalking with Arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer. When \\nthey parted, he wandered through Farthen Dûr, conversing with Saphira. Despite \\nhis prodding, she refused to tell him what Arya had said to her. Eventually his \\nthoughts turned to Murtagh and then to Nasuada’s advice.I’ll get something \\nto eat, then go see him, he decided.Will you wait for me so I can return \\nto the dragonhold with you?\\nI will wait—go,said Saphira.\\nWith a grateful \\nsmile, Eragon dashed to Tronjheim, ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen, then \\nfollowed Nasuada’s instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a \\nman and a dwarf. When he requested entrance, the dwarf banged on the door three \\ntimes, then unbolted it. “Just holler when you want to leave,” said the man \\nwith a friendly smile.\\nThe cell was \\nwarm and well lit, with a washbasin in one corner and a writing desk—equipped \\nwith quills and ink—in another. The ceiling was extensively carved with \\nlacquered figures; the floor was covered with a plush rug. Murtagh lay on a \\nstout bed, reading a scroll. He looked up in surprise and exclaimed cheerily, \\n“Eragon! I’d hoped you would come!”\\n“How did . . . I \\nmean I thought—”\\n“You thought I \\nwas stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack,” said Murtagh, rolling upright \\nwith a grin. “Actually, I expected the same thing, but Ajihad lets me have all \\nthis as long as I don’t cause trouble. And they bring me huge meals, as well as \\nanything I want from the library. If I’m not careful, I’ll turn into a fat \\nscholar.”\\nEragon laughed, \\nand with a wondering smile seated himself next to Murtagh. “But aren’t you \\nangry? You’re still a prisoner.”\\n“Oh, I was at \\nfirst,” said Murtagh with a shrug. “But the more I thought about it, the more I \\ncame to realize that this is really the best place for me. Even if Ajihad gave \\nme my freedom, I would stay in my room most of the time anyway.”\\n“But why?”\\n“You know well \\nenough. No one would be at ease around me, knowing my true identity, and there \\nwould always be people who wouldn’t limit themselves to harsh looks or words. \\nBut enough of that, I’m eager to know what’s new. Come, tell me.”\\nEragon recounted \\nthe events of the past two days, including his encounter with the Twins in the \\nlibrary. When he finished, Murtagh leaned back reflectively. “I suspect,” he \\nsaid, “that Arya is more important than either of us thought. Consider what \\nyou’ve learned: she is a master of the sword, powerful in magic, and, most \\nsignificantly, was chosen to guard Saphira’s egg. She cannot be ordinary, even \\namong the elves.”\\nEragon agreed.\\nMurtagh stared \\nat the ceiling. “You know, I find this imprisonment oddly peaceful. For once in \\nmy life I don’t have to be afraid. I know I ought to be . . . yet something \\nabout this place puts me at ease. A good night’s sleep helps, too.”\\n“I know what you \\nmean,” said Eragon wryly. He moved to a softer place on the bed. “Nasuada said \\nthat she visited you. Did she say anything interesting?”\\nMurtagh’s gaze \\nshifted into the distance, and he shook his head. “No, she only wanted to meet \\nme. Doesn’t she look like a princess? And the way she carries herself! When she \\nfirst entered through that doorway, I thought she was one of the great ladies \\nof Galbatorix’s court. I’ve seen earls and counts who had wives that, compared \\nto her, were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility.”\\nEragon listened \\nto his praise with growing apprehension.It may mean nothing, he reminded \\nhimself.You’re leaping to conclusions. Yet the foreboding would not \\nleave him. Trying to shake off the feeling, he asked, “How long are you going \\nto remain imprisoned, Murtagh? You can’t hide forever.”\\nMurtagh shrugged \\ncarelessly, but there was weight behind his words. “For now I’m content to stay \\nand rest. There’s no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself \\nto the Twins’ examination. No doubt I’ll tire of this eventually, but for now . \\n. . I am content.”\\nT HESHADOWS \\nLENGTHEN\\nSaphira woke \\nEragon with a sharp rap of her snout, bruising him with her hard jaw. “Ouch!” \\nhe exclaimed, sitting upright. The cave was dark except for a faint glow \\nemanating from the shuttered lantern. Outside in the dragonhold, Isidar Mithrim \\nglittered with a thousand different colors, illuminated by its girdle of \\nlanterns.\\nAn agitated \\ndwarf stood in the entrance to the cave, wringing his hands. “You must come, \\nArgetlam! Great trouble—Ajihad summons you. There is no time!”\\n“What’s wrong?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nThe dwarf only \\nshook his head, beard wagging. “Go, you must! Carkna bragha! Now!”\\nEragon belted on \\nZar’roc, grabbed his bow and arrows, then strapped the saddle onto Saphira.So \\nmuch for a good night’s sleep, she groused, crouching low to the floor so \\nhe could clamber onto her back. He yawned loudly as Saphira launched herself \\nfrom the cave.\\nOrik was waiting \\nfor them with a grim expression when they landed at Tronjheim’s gates. “Come, \\nthe others are waiting.” He led them through Tronjheim to Ajihad’s study. On \\nthe way, Eragon plied him with questions, but Orik would only say, “I don’t know \\nenough myself—wait until you hear Ajihad.”\\nThe large study \\ndoor was opened by a pair of burly guards. Ajihad stood behind his desk, \\nbleakly inspecting a map. Arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well. \\nAjihad looked up. “Good, you’re here, Eragon. Meet Jörmundur, my second in \\ncommand.”\\nThey \\nacknowledged each other, then turned their attention to Ajihad. “I roused the \\nfive of you because we are all in grave danger. About half an hour ago a dwarf \\nran out of an abandoned tunnel under Tronjheim. He was bleeding and nearly \\nincoherent, but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what was pursuing \\nhim: an army of Urgals, maybe a day’s march from here.”\\nShocked silence \\nfilled the study. Then Jörmundur swore explosively and began asking questions \\nat the same time Orik did. Arya remained silent. Ajihad raised his hands. \\n“Quiet! There is more. The Urgals aren’t approachingover land, butunder \\nit. They’re in the tunnels . . . we’re going to be attacked from below.”\\nEragon raised \\nhis voice in the din that followed. “Why didn’t the dwarves know about this \\nsooner? How did the Urgals find the tunnels?”\\n“We’re lucky to \\nknow about it this early!” bellowed Orik. Everyone stopped talking to hear him. \\n“There are hundreds of tunnels throughout the Beor Mountains, uninhabited since \\nthe day they were mined. The only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who \\ndon’t want contact with anyone. We could have just as easily received no \\nwarning at all.”\\nAjihad pointed \\nat the map, and Eragon moved closer. The map depicted the southern half of \\nAlagaësia, but unlike Eragon’s, it showed the entire Beor Mountain range in \\ndetail. Ajihad’s finger was on the section of the Beor Mountains that touched \\nSurda’s eastern border. “This,” he said, “is where the dwarf claimed to have \\ncome from.”\\n“Orthíad!” \\nexclaimed Orik. At Jörmundur’s puzzled inquiry, he explained, “It’s an ancient \\ndwelling of ours that was deserted when Tronjheim was completed. During its \\ntime it was the greatest of our cities. But no one’s lived there for \\ncenturies.”\\n“And it’s old \\nenough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed,” said Ajihad. “That’s how we \\nsurmise it was discovered from the surface. I suspect that Orthíad is now being \\ncalled Ithrö Zhâda. That’s where the Urgal column that was chasing Eragon and \\nSaphira was supposed to go, and I’m sure it’s where the Urgals have been \\nmigrating all year. From Ithrö Zhâda they can travel anywhere they want in the \\nBeor Mountains. They have the power to destroy both the Varden and the \\ndwarves.”\\nJörmundur bent \\nover the map, eyeing it carefully. “Do you know how many Urgals there are? Are \\nGalbatorix’s troops with them? We can’t plan a defense without knowing how \\nlarge their army is.”\\nAjihad replied \\nunhappily, “We’re unsure about both those things, yet our survival rests on \\nthat last question. If Galbatorix has augmented the Urgals’ ranks with his own \\nmen, we don’t stand a chance. But if he hasn’t—because he still doesn’t want \\nhis alliance with the Urgals revealed, or for some other reason—it’s possible \\nwe can win. Neither Orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour. Even so, \\nI sent runners to both of them with news of our plight. At the very least they \\nwon’t be caught by surprise if we fall.”\\nHe drew a hand \\nacross his coal-black brow. “I’ve already talked with Hrothgar, and we’ve \\ndecided on a course of action. Our only hope is to contain the Urgals in three \\nof the larger tunnels and channel them into Farthen Dûr so they don’t swarm \\ninside Tronjheim like locusts.\\n“I need you, \\nEragon and Arya, to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels. The job is \\ntoo big for normal means. Two groups of dwarves are already working on it: one \\noutside Tronjheim, the other beneath it. Eragon, you’re to work with the group \\noutside. Arya, you’ll be with the one underground; Orik will guide you to them.”\\n“Why not \\ncollapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“Because,” said \\nOrik, “that would force the Urgals to clear away the rubble, and they might \\ndecide to go in a direction we don’t want them to. Plus, if we cut ourselves \\noff, they could attack other dwarf cities—which we wouldn’t be able to assist \\nin time.”\\n“There’s also \\nanother reason,” said Ajihad. “Hrothgar warned me that Tronjheim sits on such a \\ndense network of tunnels that if too many are weakened, sections of the city \\nwill sink into the ground under their own weight. We can’t risk that.”\\nJörmundur \\nlistened intently, then asked, “So there won’t be any fighting inside \\nTronjheim? You said the Urgals would be channeled outside the city, into \\nFarthen Dûr.”\\nAjihad responded \\nquickly, “That’s right. We can’t defend Tronjheim’s entire perimeter—it’s too \\nbig for our forces—so we’re going to seal all the passageways and gates leading \\ninto it. That will force the Urgals out onto the flats surrounding Tronjheim, where \\nthere’s plenty of maneuvering room for our armies. Since the Urgals have access \\nto the tunnels, we cannot risk an extended battle. As long as they are here, we \\nwill be in constant danger of them quarrying up through Tronjheim’s floor. If \\nthat happens, we’ll be trapped, attacked from both the outside and inside. We \\nhave to prevent the Urgals from taking Tronjheim. If they secure it, it’s \\ndoubtful we will have the strength to roust them.”\\n“And what of our \\nfamilies?” asked Jörmundur. “I won’t see my wife and son murdered by Urgals.”\\nThe lines \\ndeepened on Ajihad’s face. “All the women and children are being evacuated into \\nthe surrounding valleys. If we are defeated, they have guides who will take \\nthem to Surda. That’s all I can do, under the circumstances.”\\nJörmundur \\nstruggled to hide his relief. “Sir, is Nasuada going as well?”\\n“She is not \\npleased, but yes.” All eyes were on Ajihad as he squared his shoulders and \\nannounced, “The Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours. We know their numbers \\nare great, but wemust hold Farthen Dûr. Failure will mean the dwarves’ \\ndownfall, death to the Varden—and eventual defeat for Surda and the elves. This \\nis one battle we cannot lose. Now go and complete your tasks! Jörmundur, ready \\nthe men to fight.”\\n\\xa0\\nThey left the \\nstudy and scattered: Jörmundur to the barracks, Orik and Arya to the stairs \\nleading underground, and Eragon and Saphira down one of Tronjheim’s four main \\nhalls. Despite the early hour, the city-mountain swarmed like an anthill. \\nPeople were running, shouting messages, and carrying bundles of belongings.\\nEragon had \\nfought and killed before, but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear \\ninto his chest. He had never had a chance to anticipate a fight. Now that he \\ndid, it filled him with dread. He was confident when facing only a few \\nopponents—he knew he could easily defeat three or four Urgals with Zar’roc and \\nmagic—but in a large conflict, anything could happen.\\nThey exited \\nTronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help. Without the \\nsun or moon, the inside of Farthen Dûr was dark as lampblack, punctuated by \\nglittering lanterns bobbing jerkily in the crater.Perhaps they’re on the far \\nside of Tronjheim, suggested Saphira. Eragon agreed and swung onto her \\nback.\\nThey glided \\naround Tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight. Saphira angled \\ntoward them, then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled \\ndwarves who were busy digging with pickaxes. Eragon quickly explained why he \\nwas there. A sharp-nosed dwarf told him, “There’s a tunnel about four yards \\ndirectly underneath us. Any help you could give us would be appreciated.”\\n“If you clear \\nthe area over the tunnel, I’ll see what I can do.” The sharp-nosed dwarf looked \\ndoubtful, but ordered the diggers off the site.\\nBreathing slowly, \\nEragon prepared to use magic. It might be possible to actually move all the \\ndirt off the tunnel, but he needed to conserve his strength for later. Instead, \\nhe would try to collapse the tunnel by applying force to weak sections of its \\nceiling.\\n“Thrysta deloi,” \\nhe whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil. Almost immediately they \\nencountered rock. He ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the \\nhollow emptiness of the tunnel. Then he began searching for flaws in the rock. \\nEvery time he found one, he pushed on it, elongating and widening it. It was \\nstrenuous work, but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand. \\nHe made no visible progress—a fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves.\\nEragon \\npersevered. Before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be \\nheard clearly on the surface. There was a persistent screech, then the ground \\nslid inward like water draining from a tub, leaving a gaping hole seven yards \\nacross.\\nAs the delighted \\ndwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble, the sharp-nosed dwarf led Eragon to \\nthe next tunnel. This one was much more difficult to collapse, but he managed \\nto duplicate the feat. Over the next few hours, he collapsed over a half-dozen \\ntunnels throughout Farthen Dûr, with Saphira’s help.\\nLight crept into \\nthe small patch of sky above them as he worked. It was not enough to see by, \\nbut it bolstered Eragon’s confidence. He turned away from the crumpled ruins of \\nthe latest tunnel and surveyed the land with interest.\\nA mass exodus of \\nwomen and children, along with the Varden’s elders, streamed out of Tronjheim. \\nEveryone carried loads of provisions, clothes, and belongings. A small group of \\nwarriors, predominantly boys and old men, accompanied them.\\nMost of the \\nactivity, however, was at the base of Tronjheim, where the Varden and dwarves \\nwere assembling their army, which was divided into three battalions. Each \\nsection bore the Varden’s standard: a white dragon holding a rose above a sword \\npointing downward on a purple field.\\nThe men were silent, \\nironfisted. Their hair flowed loosely from under their helmets. Many warriors \\nhad only a sword and a shield, but there were several ranks of spear- and \\npikemen. In the rear of the battalions, archers tested their bowstrings.\\nThe dwarves were \\ngarbed in heavy battle gear. Burnished steel hauberks hung to their knees, and \\nthick roundshields, stamped with the crests of their clan, rested on their left \\narms. Short swords were sheathed at their waists, while in their right hands \\nthey carried mattocks or war axes. Their legs were covered with extra-fine \\nmail. They wore iron caps and brass-studded boots.\\nA small figure \\ndetached itself from the far battalion and hurried toward Eragon and Saphira. \\nIt was Orik, clad like the other dwarves. “Ajihad wants you to join the army,” \\nhe said. “There are no more tunnels to cave in. Food is waiting for both of \\nyou.”\\nEragon and \\nSaphira accompanied Orik to a tent, where they found bread and water for Eragon \\nand a pile of dried meat for Saphira. They ate it without complaint; it was \\nbetter than going hungry.\\nWhen they \\nfinished, Orik told them to wait and disappeared into the battalion’s ranks. He \\nreturned, leading a line of dwarves burdened with tall piles of plate armor. \\nOrik lifted a section of it and handed it to Eragon.\\n“What is this?” \\nasked Eragon, fingering the polished metal. The armor was intricately wrought \\nwith engraving and gold filigree. It was an inch thick in places and very \\nheavy. No man could fight under that much weight. And there were far too many \\npieces for one person.\\n“A gift from \\nHrothgar,” said Orik, looking pleased with himself. “It has lain so long among \\nour other treasures that it was almost forgotten. It was forged in another age, \\nbefore the fall of the Riders.”\\n“But what’s itfor \\n?” asked Eragon.\\n“Why, it’s \\ndragon armor, of course! You don’t think that dragons went into battle \\nunprotected? Complete sets are rare because they took so long to make and \\nbecause dragons were always growing. Still, Saphira isn’t too big yet, so this \\nshould fit her reasonably well.”\\nDragon armor!As Saphira nosed \\none of the pieces, Eragon asked,What do you think?\\nLet’s try it on,she said, a \\nfierce gleam in her eye.\\nAfter a good \\ndeal of struggling, Eragon and Orik stepped back to admire the result. \\nSaphira’s entire neck—except for the spikes along its ridge—was covered with \\ntriangular scales of overlapping armor. Her belly and chest were protected by \\nthe heaviest plates, while the lightest ones were on her tail. Her legs and \\nback were completely encased. Her wings were left bare. A single molded plate \\nlay on top of her head, leaving her lower jaw free to bite and snap.\\nSaphira arched \\nher neck experimentally, and the armor flexed smoothly with her.This will \\nslow me down, but it’ll help stop the arrows. How do I look?\\nVery intimidating,replied Eragon \\ntruthfully. That pleased her.\\nOrik picked up \\nthe remaining items from the ground. “I brought you armor as well, though it \\ntook much searching to find your size. We rarely forge arms for men or elves. I \\ndon’t know who this was made for, but it has never been used and should serve \\nyou well.”\\nOver Eragon’s \\nhead went a stiff shirt of leather-backed mail that fell to his knees like a \\nskirt. It rested heavily on his shoulders and clinked when he moved. He belted \\nZar’roc over it, which helped keep the mail from swinging. On his head went a \\nleather cap, then a mail coif, and finally a gold-and-silver helm. Bracers were \\nstrapped to his forearms, and greaves to his lower legs. For his hands there \\nwere mail-backed gloves. Last, Orik handed him a broad shield emblazoned with \\nan oak tree.\\nKnowing that \\nwhat he and Saphira had been given was worth several fortunes, Eragon bowed and \\nsaid, “Thank you for these gifts. Hrothgar’s presents are greatly appreciated.”\\n“Don’t give \\nthanks now,” said Orik with a chuckle. “Wait until the armor saves your life.”\\nThe warriors \\naround them began marching away. The three battalions were repositioning \\nthemselves in different parts of Farthen Dûr. Unsure of what they should do, \\nEragon looked at Orik, who shrugged and said, “I suppose we should accompany \\nthem.” They trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the crater wall. \\nEragon asked about the Urgals, but Orik only knew that scouts had been posted \\nunderground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet.\\nThe battalion \\nhalted at one of the collapsed tunnels. The dwarves had piled the rubble so \\nthat anyone inside the tunnel could easily climb out.This must be one of the \\nplaces they’re going to force the Urgals to surface, Saphira pointed out.\\nHundreds of \\nlanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground. They provided a great \\npool of light that glowed like an evening sun. Fires blazed along the rim of \\nthe tunnel’s roof, huge cauldrons of pitch heating over them. Eragon looked \\naway, fighting back revulsion. It was a terrible way to kill anyone, even an \\nUrgal.\\nRows of \\nsharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny \\nbarrier between the battalion and the tunnel. Eragon saw an opportunity to help \\nand joined a group of men digging trenches between the saplings. Saphira \\nassisted as well, scooping out the dirt with her giant claws. While they \\nlabored, Orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the \\narchers. Eragon drank gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed \\naround. After the trenches were finished and filled with pointed stakes, \\nSaphira and Eragon rested.\\nOrik returned to \\nfind them seated together. He wiped his brow. “All the men and dwarves are on \\nthe battlefield. Tronjheim has been sealed off. Hrothgar has taken charge of \\nthe battalion to our left. Ajihad leads the one ahead of us.”\\n“Who commands \\nthis one?”\\n“Jörmundur.” \\nOrik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground.\\nSaphira nudged \\nEragon.Look. His hand tightened on Zar’roc as he saw Murtagh, helmed, \\ncarrying a dwarven shield and his hand-and-a-half sword, approaching with \\nTornac.\\nOrik cursed and \\nleapt to his feet, but Murtagh said quickly, “It’s all right; Ajihad released \\nme.”\\n“Why would he do \\nthat?” demanded Orik.\\nMurtagh smiled \\nwryly. “He said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions. \\nApparently, he doesn’t think I would be able to do much damage even if I did \\nturn on the Varden.”\\nEragon nodded in \\nwelcome, relaxing his grip. Murtagh was an excellent and merciless \\nfighter—exactly whom Eragon wanted by his side during battle.\\n“How do we know \\nyou’re not lying?” asked Orik.\\n“Because I say \\nso,” announced a firm voice. Ajihad strode into their midst, armed for battle \\nwith a breastplate and an ivory-handled sword. He put a strong hand on Eragon’s \\nshoulder and drew him away where the others could not hear. He cast an eye over \\nEragon’s armor. “Good, Orik outfitted you.”\\n“Yes . . . has \\nanything been seen in the tunnels?”\\n“Nothing.” \\nAjihad leaned on his sword. “One of the Twins is staying in Tronjheim. He’s \\ngoing to watch the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his \\nbrother to me. I know you can speak with your mind. I need you to tell the \\nTwins anything,anything, unusual that you see while fighting. Also, I’ll \\nrelay orders to you through them. Do you understand?”\\nThe thought of \\nbeing linked to the Twins filled Eragon with loathing, but he knew it was \\nnecessary. “I do.”\\nAjihad paused. \\n“You’re not a foot soldier or horseman, nor any other type of warrior I’m used \\nto commanding. Battle may prove differently, but I think you and Saphira will \\nbe safer on the ground. In the air, you’ll be a choice target for Urgal \\narchers. Will you fight from Saphira’s back?”\\nEragon had never \\nbeen in combat on horseback, much less on Saphira. “I’m not sure what we’ll do. \\nWhen I’m on Saphira, I’m up too high to fight all but a Kull.”\\n“There will be \\nplenty of Kull, I’m afraid,” said Ajihad. He straightened, pulling his sword \\nout of the ground. “The only advice I can give you is to avoid unnecessary \\nrisks. The Varden cannot afford to lose you.” With that, he turned and left.\\nEragon returned \\nto Orik and Murtagh and hunkered next to Saphira, leaning his shield against \\nhis knees. The four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors \\naround them. Light from Farthen Dûr’s opening waned as the sun crept below the \\ncrater rim.\\nEragon turned to \\nscan the encampment and froze, heart jolting. About thirty feet away sat Arya \\nwith her bow in her lap. Though he knew it was unreasonable, he had hoped she \\nmight accompany the other women out of Farthen Dûr. Concerned, he hastened to \\nher. “You will fight?”\\n“I do what I \\nmust,” Arya said calmly.\\n“But it’s too \\ndangerous!”\\nHer face \\ndarkened. “Do not pamper me, human. Elves train both their men and women to \\nfight. I am not one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is \\ndanger. I was given the task of protecting Saphira’s egg . . . which I failed. \\nMy breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if I did not guard you and \\nSaphira on this field. You forget that I am stronger with magic than any here, \\nincluding you. If the Shade comes, who can defeat him but me? And who else has \\nthe right?”\\nEragon stared at \\nher helplessly, knowing she was right and hating the fact. “Then stay safe.” Out \\nof desperation, he added in the ancient language, “Wiol pömnuria ilian.” For my \\nhappiness.\\nArya turned her \\ngaze away uneasily, the fringe of her hair obscuring her face. She ran a hand \\nalong her polished bow, then murmured, “It is my wyrd to be here. The debt must \\nbe paid.”\\nHe abruptly \\nretreated to Saphira. Murtagh looked at him curiously. “What did she say?”\\n“Nothing.”\\nWrapped in their \\nown thoughts, the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled \\nby. Farthen Dûr’s crater again grew black, except for the sanguine lantern glow \\nand the fires heating the pitch. Eragon alternated between myopically examining \\nthe links of his mail and spying on Arya. Orik repeatedly ran a whetstone over \\nthe blade of his ax, periodically eyeing the edge between strokes; the rasp of \\nmetal on stone was irritating. Murtagh just stared into the distance.\\nOccasionally, \\nmessengers ran through the encampment, causing the warriors to surge to their \\nfeet. But it always proved to be a false alarm. The men and dwarves became \\nstrained; angry voices were often heard. The worst part about Farthen Dûr was \\nthe lack of wind—the air was dead, motionless. Even when it grew warm and \\nstifling and filled with smoke, there was no reprieve.\\nAs the night \\ndragged on, the battlefield stilled, silent as death. Muscles stiffened from \\nthe waiting. Eragon stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids. He \\nshook himself to alertness and tried to focus through his stupor.\\nFinally Orik \\nsaid, “It’s late. We should sleep. If anything happens, the others will wake \\nus.” Murtagh grumbled, but Eragon was too tired to complain. He curled up \\nagainst Saphira, using his shield as a pillow. As his eyes closed, he saw that \\nArya was still awake, watching over them.\\nHis dreams were \\nconfused and disturbing, full of horned beasts and unseen menaces. Over and \\nover he heard a deep voice ask, “Are you ready?” But he never had an answer. \\nPlagued by such visions, his sleep was shallow and uneasy until something \\ntouched his arm. He woke with a start.\\nB ATTLEUNDER \\nFARTHENDÛR\\n“It has begun,” \\nArya said with a sorrowful expression. The troops in the encampment stood \\nalertly with their weapons drawn. Orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough \\nroom. Arya nocked an arrow and held it ready to shoot.\\n“A scout ran out \\nof a tunnel a few minutes ago,” said Murtagh to Eragon. “The Urgals are \\ncoming.”\\nTogether they \\nwatched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened \\nstakes. A minute dragged by, then another . . . and another. Without taking his \\neyes from the tunnel, Eragon hoisted himself into Saphira’s saddle, Zar’roc in \\nhis hand, a comfortable weight. Murtagh mounted Tornac beside him. Then a man \\ncried, “I hear them!”\\nThe warriors \\nstiffened; grips tightened on weapons. No one moved . . . no one breathed. \\nSomewhere a horse nickered.\\nHarsh Urgal \\nshouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnel’s opening. \\nAt a command, the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides, pouring the \\nscalding liquid into the tunnel’s hungry throat. The monsters howled in pain, \\narms flailing. A torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch, and an orange pillar \\nof greasy flames roared up in the opening, engulfing the Urgals in an inferno. \\nSickened, Eragon looked across Farthen Dûr at the other two battalions and saw \\nsimilar fires by each. He sheathed Zar’roc and strung his bow.\\nMore Urgals soon \\ntamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned \\nbrethren. They clumped together, presenting a solid wall to the men and \\ndwarves. Behind the palisade Orik had helped build, the first row of archers \\npulled on their bows and fired. Eragon and Arya added their arrows to the \\ndeadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the Urgals’ ranks.\\nThe Urgal line \\nwavered, threatening to break, but they covered themselves with their shields \\nand weathered the attack. Again the archers fired, but the Urgals continued to \\nstream onto the surface at a ferocious rate.\\nEragon was \\ndismayed by their numbers. They were supposed to kill every single one? It \\nseemed a madman’s task. His only encouragement was that he saw none of \\nGalbatorix’s troops with the Urgals. Not yet, at least.\\nThe opposing \\narmy formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly. Tattered \\nand sullen standards were raised in the monsters’ midst. Baleful notes echoed \\nthrough Farthen Dûr as war horns sounded. The entire group of Urgals charged \\nwith savage war cries.\\nThey dashed \\nagainst the rows of stakes, covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as \\nthe ranks at the vanguard were crushed against the posts. A cloud of black \\narrows flew over the barrier at the crouched defenders. Eragon ducked behind \\nhis shield, and Saphira covered her head. Arrows rattled harmlessly against her \\narmor.\\nMomentarily \\nfoiled by the pickets, the Urgal horde milled with confusion. The Varden \\nbunched together, waiting for the next attack. After a pause, the war cries \\nwere raised again as the Urgals surged forward. The assault was bitter. Its \\nmomentum carried the Urgals through the stakes, where a line of pikemen jabbed \\nfrantically at their ranks, trying to repel them. The pikemen held briefly, but \\nthe ominous tide of Urgals could not be halted, and they were overwhelmed.\\nThe first lines \\nof defense breached, the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first \\ntime. A deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the \\nconflict. Saphira bellowed and leapt toward the fight, diving into a whirlwind \\nof noise and blurred action.\\nWith her jaws \\nand talons, Saphira tore through an Urgal. Her teeth were as lethal as any \\nsword, her tail a giant mace. From her back, Eragon parried a hammer blow from \\nan Urgal chief, protecting her vulnerable wings. Zar’roc’s crimson blade seemed \\nto gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length.\\nFrom the corner \\nof his eye, Eragon saw Orik hewing Urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax. \\nBeside the dwarf was Murtagh on Tornac, his face disfigured by a vicious snarl \\nas he swung his sword angrily, cutting through every defense. Then Saphira spun \\naround, and Eragon saw Arya leap past the lifeless body of an opponent.\\nAn Urgal bowled \\nover a wounded dwarf and hacked at Saphira’s front right leg. His sword skated \\noff her armor with a burst of sparks. Eragon smote him on the head, but Zar’roc \\nstuck in the monster’s horns and was yanked from his grasp. With a curse he \\ndived off Saphira and tackled the Urgal, smashing his face with the shield. He \\njerked Zar’roc out of the horns, then dodged as another Urgal charged him.\\nSaphira, I need \\nyou!he \\nshouted, but the battle’s tide had separated them. Suddenly a Kull jumped at \\nhim, club raised for a blow. Unable to lift his shield in time, Eragon uttered, \\n“Jierda!” The Kull’s head snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke. \\nFour more Urgals succumbed to Zar’roc’s thirsty bite, then Murtagh rode up \\nbeside Eragon, driving the press of Urgals backward.\\n“Come on!” he \\nshouted, and reached down from Tornac, pulling Eragon onto the horse. They \\nrushed toward Saphira, who was embroiled in a mass of enemies. Twelve spear-wielding \\nUrgals encircled her, needling her with their lances. They had already managed \\nto prick both of her wings. Her blood splattered the ground. Every time she \\nrushed at one of the Urgals, they bunched together and jabbed at her eyes, \\nforcing her to retreat. She tried to sweep the spears away with her talons, but \\nthe Urgals jumped back and evaded her.\\nThe sight of \\nSaphira’s blood enraged Eragon. He swung off Tornac with a wild cry and stabbed \\nthe nearest Urgal through the chest, withholding nothing in his frenzied \\nattempt to help Saphira. His attack provided the distraction she needed to \\nbreak free. With a kick, she sent an Urgal flying, then barreled to him. Eragon \\ngrabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle. Murtagh \\nraised his hand, then charged into another knot of Urgals.\\nBy unspoken \\nconsent, Saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies, seeking a \\nrespite from the madness. Eragon’s breath trembled. His muscles were clenched, \\nready to ward off the next attack. Every fiber of his being thrilled with \\nenergy, making him feel more alive than ever before.\\nSaphira circled \\nlong enough for them to recover their strength, then descended toward the \\nUrgals, skimming the ground to avoid detection. She approached the monsters from \\nbehind, where their archers were gathered.\\nBefore the \\nUrgals realized what was happening, Eragon lopped off the heads of two archers, \\nand Saphira disemboweled three others. She took off again as alarms sounded, \\nquickly soaring out of bow range.\\nThey repeated \\nthe tactic on a different flank of the army. Saphira’s stealth and speed, \\ncombined with the dim lighting, made it nearly impossible for the Urgals to \\npredict where she would strike next. Eragon used his bow whenever Saphira was \\nin the air, but he quickly ran out of arrows. Soon the only thing left in his \\nquiver was magic, which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately \\nneeded.\\nSaphira’s \\nflights over the combatants gave Eragon a unique understanding of how the \\nbattle was progressing. There were three separate fights raging in Farthen Dûr, \\none by each open tunnel. The Urgals were disadvantaged by the dispersal of \\ntheir forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the tunnels at \\nonce. Even so, the Varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from \\nadvancing and were slowly being driven back toward Tronjheim. The defenders \\nseemed insignificant against the mass of Urgals, whose numbers continued to \\nincrease as they poured out of the tunnels.\\nThe Urgals had \\norganized themselves around several standards, each representing a clan, but it \\nwas unclear who commanded them overall. The clans paid no attention to each \\nother, as if they were receiving orders from elsewhere. Eragon wished he knew \\nwho was in charge so he and Saphira could kill him.\\nRemembering \\nAjihad’s orders, he began relaying information to the Twins. They were \\ninterested by what he had to say about the Urgals’ apparent lack of a leader \\nand questioned him closely. The exchange was smooth, if brief. The Twins told \\nhim,You’re ordered to assist Hrothgar; the fight goes badly for him.\\nUnderstood,Eragon \\nresponded.\\nSaphira swiftly \\nflew to the besieged dwarves, swooping low over Hrothgar. Arrayed in golden \\narmor, the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin, wielding Volund, \\nthe hammer of his ancestors. His white beard caught the lantern light as he \\nlooked up at Saphira. Admiration glinted in his eyes.\\nSaphira landed \\nbeside the dwarves and faced the oncoming Urgals. Even the bravest Kull quailed \\nbefore her ferocity, allowing the dwarves to surge forward. Eragon tried to \\nkeep Saphira safe. Her left flank was protected by the dwarves, but to her \\nfront and right raged a sea of enemies. He showed no mercy on those and took \\nevery advantage he could, using magic whenever Zar’roc could not serve him. A \\nspear bounced off his shield, denting it and leaving him with a bruised \\nshoulder. Shaking off the pain, he cleaved open an Urgal’s skull, mixing brains \\nwith metal and bone.\\nHe was in awe of \\nHrothgar—who, though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves, \\nwas still undiminished on the battlefield. No Urgal, Kull or not, could stand \\nbefore the dwarf king and his guards and live. Every time Volund struck, it \\nsounded the gong of death for another enemy. After a spear downed one of his \\nwarriors, Hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and, with astounding strength, \\nhurled it completely through its owner twenty yards away. Such heroism \\nemboldened Eragon to ever greater risks, seeking to hold his own with the \\nmighty king.\\nEragon lunged at \\na giant Kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from Saphira’s saddle. Before \\nhe could recover, the Kull darted past Saphira’s defenses and swung his sword. \\nThe brunt of the blow caught Eragon on the side of his helm, throwing him \\nbackward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring thunderously.\\nStunned, he \\ntried to pull himself upright, but the Kull had already prepared for another \\nblow. As the Kull’s arm descended, a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from \\nhis chest. Howling, the monster toppled to the side. In his place stood Angela.\\nThe witch wore a \\nlong red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green. She bore \\na strange two-handed weapon—a long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to \\neach end. Angela winked at Eragon mischievously, then dashed away, spinning her \\nstaff-sword like a dervish. Close behind her was Solembum in the form of a \\nyoung shaggy-haired boy. He held a small black dagger, sharp teeth bared in a \\nferal snarl.\\nStill dazed from \\nhis battering, Eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle. Saphira \\njumped into the air and wheeled high above, letting him recuperate. He scanned \\nFarthen Dûr’s plains and saw, to his dismay, that all three battles were going \\nbadly. Neither Ajihad, Jörmundur, nor Hrothgar could stop the Urgals. There \\nwere simply too many.\\nEragon wondered \\nhow many Urgals he could kill at once with magic. He knew his limits fairly \\nwell. If he were to kill enough to make a difference . . . it would probably be \\nsuicide. That might be what it took to win.\\nThe fighting \\ncontinued for one endless hour after another. The Varden and dwarves were \\nexhausted, but the Urgals remained fresh with reinforcements.\\nIt was a \\nnightmare for Eragon. Though he and Saphira fought their hardest, there was \\nalways another Urgal to take the place of the one just killed. His whole body \\nhurt—especially his head. Every time he used magic he lost a little more \\nenergy. Saphira was in better condition, though her wings were punctured with \\nsmall wounds.\\nAs he parried a \\nblow, the Twins contacted him urgently.There are loud noises under \\nTronjheim. It sounds like Urgals are trying to dig into the city! We need you \\nand Arya to collapse any tunnels they’re excavating.\\nEragon \\ndispatched his opponent with a sword thrust.We’ll be right there. He \\nlooked for Arya and saw her engaged with a knot of struggling Urgals. Saphira \\nquickly forged a path to the elf, leaving a pile of crumpled bodies in her \\nwake. Eragon extended his hand and said, “Get on!”\\nArya jumped onto \\nSaphira’s back without hesitation. She wrapped her right arm around Eragon’s \\nwaist, wielding her bloodstained sword with the other. As Saphira crouched to \\ntake off, an Urgal ran at her, howling, then lifted an ax and smashed her in \\nthe chest.\\nSaphira roared \\nwith pain and lurched forward, feet leaving the ground. Her wings snapped open, \\nstraining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side, right \\nwingtip scraping the ground. Below them, the Urgal pulled back his arm to throw \\nthe ax. But Arya raised her palm, shouting, and an emerald ball of energy shot \\nfrom her hand, killing the Urgal. With a colossal heave of her shoulders, \\nSaphira righted herself, barely making it over the heads of the warriors. She \\npulled away from the battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath.\\nAre you all \\nright?asked \\nEragon, concerned. He could not see where she had been struck.\\nI’ll live,she said grimly,but \\nthe front of my armor has been crushed together.It hurts my chest, and I’m \\nhaving trouble moving.\\nCan you get us \\nto the dragonhold?\\n\\n. . . We’ll see. \\nEragon explained \\nSaphira’s condition to Arya. “I’ll stay and help Saphira when we land,” she \\noffered. “Once she is free of the armor, I will join you.”\\n“Thank you,” he \\nsaid. The flight was laborious for Saphira; she glided whenever she could. When \\nthey reached the dragonhold, she dropped heavily to Isidar Mithrim, where the \\nTwins were supposed to be watching the battle, but it was empty. Eragon jumped \\nto the floor and winced as he saw the damage the Urgal had done. Four of the \\nmetal plates on Saphira’s chest had been hammered together, restricting her \\nability to bend and breathe. “Stay well,” he said, putting a hand on her side, \\nthen ran out the archway.\\nHe stopped and \\nswore. He was at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. Because of his \\nworry for Saphira, he had not considered how he would get to Tronjheim’s \\nbase—where the Urgals were breaking in. There was no time to climb down. He \\nlooked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs, then grabbed one of the \\nleather pads and threw himself down on it.\\nThe stone slide \\nwas smooth as lacquered wood. With the leather underneath him, he accelerated \\nalmost instantly to a frightening speed, the walls blurring and the curve of \\nthe slide pressing him high against the wall. Eragon lay completely flat so he \\nwould go faster. The air rushed past his helm, making it vibrate like a weather \\nvane in a gale. The trough was too confined for him, and he was perilously \\nclose to flying out, but as long as he kept his arms and legs still, he was \\nsafe.\\nIt was a swift \\ndescent, but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom. The \\nslide leveled out at the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge \\ncarnelian floor.\\nWhen he finally \\ncame to a stop, he was too dizzy to walk. His first attempt to stand made him \\nnauseated, so he curled up, head in his hands, and waited for things to stop \\nspinning. When he felt better, he stood and warily looked around.\\nThe great \\nchamber was completely deserted, the silence unsettling. Rosy light filtered \\ndown from Isidar Mithrim. He faltered—Where was he supposed to go?—and cast out \\nhis mind for the Twins. Nothing. He froze as loud knocking echoed through \\nTronjheim.\\nAn explosion \\nsplit the air. A long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet \\nup. Needles of rocks flew outward as it crashed down. Eragon stumbled back, \\nstunned, groping for Zar’roc. The twisted shapes of Urgals clambered out of the \\nhole in the floor.\\nEragon \\nhesitated. Should he flee? Or should he stay and try to close the tunnel? Even \\nif he managed to seal it before the Urgals attacked him, what if Tronjheim was \\nalready breached elsewhere? He could not find all the places in time to prevent \\nthe city-mountain from being captured.But if I run to one of Tronjheim’s \\ngates and blast it open, the Varden could retake Tronjheim without having to \\nsiege it. Before he could decide, a tall man garbed entirely in black armor \\nemerged from the tunnel and looked directly at him.\\nIt was Durza.\\nThe Shade \\ncarried his pale blade marked with the scratch from Ajihad. A black roundshield \\nwith a crimson ensign rested on his arm. His dark helmet was richly decorated, \\nlike a general’s, and a long snakeskin cloak billowed around him. Madness \\nburned in his maroon eyes, the madness of one who enjoys power and finds himself \\nin the position to use it.\\nEragon knew he \\nwas neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him. He \\nimmediately warned Saphira, though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue \\nhim. He dropped into a crouch and quickly reviewed what Brom had told him about \\nfighting another magic user. It was not encouraging. And Ajihad had said that \\nShades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart.\\nDurza gazed at \\nhim contemptuously and said, “Kaz jtierl trazhid! Otrag bagh.” The Urgals eyed \\nEragon suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room. Durza \\nslowly approached Eragon with a triumphant expression. “So, my young Rider, we \\nmeet again. You were foolish to escape from me in Gil’ead. It will only make \\nthings worse for you in the end.”\\n“You’ll never \\ncapture me alive,” growled Eragon.\\n“Is that so?” \\nasked the Shade, raising an eyebrow. The light from the star sapphire gave his \\nskin a ghastly tint. “I don’t see your ‘friend’ Murtagh around to help you. You \\ncan’t stop me now. No one can!”\\nFear touched \\nEragon.How does he know about Murtagh? Putting all the derision he could \\ninto his voice, he jeered, “How did you like being shot?”\\nDurza’s face \\ntightened momentarily. “I will be repaid in blood for that. Now tell me where \\nyour dragon is hiding.”\\n“Never.”\\nThe Shade’s \\ncountenance darkened. “Then I will force it from you!” His sword whistled \\nthrough the air. The moment Eragon caught the blade on his shield, a mental \\nprobe spiked deep into his thoughts. Fighting to protect his consciousness, he \\nshoved Durza back and attacked with his own mind.\\nEragon battered \\nwith all his strength against the iron-hard defenses surrounding Durza’s mind, \\nbut to no avail. He swung Zar’roc, trying to catch Durza off guard. The Shade \\nknocked the blow aside effortlessly, then stabbed in return with lightning \\nspeed.\\nThe point of the \\nsword caught Eragon in the ribs, piercing his mail and driving out his breath. \\nThe mail slipped, though, and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire. \\nThe distraction was all Durza needed to break into Eragon’s mind and begin \\ntaking control.\\n“No!” cried \\nEragon, throwing himself at the Shade. His face contorted as he grappled with \\nDurza, yanking on his sword arm. Durza tried to cut Eragon’s hand, but it was \\nprotected by the mail-backed glove, which sent the blade glancing downward. As \\nEragon kicked his leg, Durza snarled and swept his black shield around, \\nknocking him to the floor. Eragon tasted blood in his mouth; his neck throbbed. \\nIgnoring his injuries, he rolled over and hurled his shield at Durza. Despite \\nthe Shade’s superior speed, the heavy shield clipped him on the hip. As Durza \\nstumbled, Eragon caught him on the upper arm with Zar’roc. A line of blood \\ntraced down the Shade’s arm.\\nEragon thrust at \\nthe Shade with his mind and drove through Durza’s weakened defenses. A flood of \\nimages suddenly engulfed him, rushing through his consciousness—\\n\\xa0\\nDurza as a young \\nboy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains. The tribe abandoned \\nthem and called his father “oathbreaker.” Only it was not Durza then, but \\nCarsaib—the name his mother crooned while combing his hair. . . . \\n\\xa0\\nThe Shade reeled \\nwildly, face twisted in pain. Eragon tried to control the torrent of memories, \\nbut the force of them was overwhelming.\\n\\xa0\\nStanding on a \\nhill over the graves of his parents, weeping that the men had not killed him as \\nwell. Then turning and stumbling blindly away, into the desert. . . . \\n\\xa0\\nDurza faced \\nEragon. Terrible hatred flowed from his maroon eyes. Eragon was on one \\nknee—almost standing—struggling to seal his mind.\\n\\xa0\\nHow the old man \\nlooked when he first saw Carsaib lying near death on a sand dune. The days it \\nhad taken Carsaib to recover and the fear he felt upon discovering that his \\nrescuer was a sorcerer. How he had pleaded to be taught the control of spirits. \\nHow Haeg had finally agreed. Called him “Desert Rat.”. . . \\n\\xa0\\nEragon was \\nstanding now. Durza charged . . . sword raised . . . shield ignored in his \\nfury.\\n\\xa0\\nThe days spent \\ntraining under the scorching sun, always alert for the lizards they caught for \\nfood. How his power slowly grew, giving him pride and confidence. The weeks \\nspent nursing his sick master after a failed spell. His joy when Haeg recovered \\n. . .\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere was not \\nenough time to react . . . not enough time. . . .\\n\\xa0\\nThe bandits who \\nattacked during the night, killing Haeg. The rage Carsaib had felt and the \\nspirits he had summoned for vengeance. But the spirits were stronger than he \\nexpected. They turned on him, possessing mind and body. He had screamed. He \\nwas—I AM DURZA!\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe sword smote \\nheavily across Eragon’s back, cutting through both mail and skin. He screamed \\nas pain blasted through him, forcing him to his knees. Agony bowed his body in \\nhalf and obliterated all thought. He swayed, barely conscious, hot blood running \\ndown the small of his back. Durza said something he could not hear.\\nIn anguish, \\nEragon raised his eyes to the heavens, tears streaming down his cheeks. \\nEverything had failed. The Varden and dwarves were destroyed. He was defeated. \\nSaphira would give herself up for his sake—she had done it before—and Arya \\nwould be recaptured or killed. Why had it ended like this? What justice could \\nthis be? All was for nothing.\\nAs he looked at \\nIsidar Mithrim far above his tortured frame, a flash of light erupted in his \\neyes, blinding him. A second later, the chamber rang with a deafening report. \\nThen his eyes cleared, and he gaped with disbelief.\\nThe star \\nsapphire had shattered. An expanding torus of huge dagger-like pieces plummeted \\ntoward the distant floor—the shimmering shards near the walls. In the center of \\nthe chamber, hurtling downward headfirst, was Saphira. Her jaws were open and \\nfrom between them erupted a great tongue of flame, bright yellow and tinged \\nwith blue. On her back was Arya: hair billowing wildly, arm uplifted, palm \\nglowing with a nimbus of green magic.\\nTime seemed to \\nslow as Eragon saw Durza tilt his head toward the ceiling. First shock, then \\nanger contorted the Shade’s face. Sneering defiantly, he raised his hand and \\npointed at Saphira, a word forming on his lips.\\nA hidden reserve \\nof strength suddenly welled up inside Eragon, dredged from the deepest part of \\nhis being. His fingers curled around the hilt of his sword. He plunged through \\nthe barrier in his mind and took hold of the magic. All his pain and rage \\nfocused on one word:\\n“Brisingr!” \\nZar’roc blazed \\nwith bloody light, heatless flames running along it . . .\\nHe lunged \\nforward . . .\\nAnd stabbed \\nDurza in the heart.\\nDurza looked \\ndown with shock at the blade protruding from his breast. His mouth was open, \\nbut instead of words, an unearthly howl burst from him. His sword dropped from \\nnerveless fingers. He grasped Zar’roc as if to pull it out, but it was lodged \\nfirmly in him.\\nThen Durza’s \\nskin turned transparent. Under it was neither flesh nor bone, but swirling \\npatterns of darkness. He shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated, \\nsplitting his skin. With one last cry, Durza was rent from head to toe, \\nreleasing the darkness, which separated into three entities who flew through \\nTronjheim’s walls and out of Farthen Dûr. The Shade was gone.\\nBereft of \\nstrength, Eragon fell back with arms outstretched. Above him, Saphira and Arya \\nhad nearly reached the floor—it looked as if they were going to smash into it \\nwith the deadly remains of Isidar Mithrim. As his sight faded, Saphira, Arya, \\nthe myriad fragments—all seemed to stop falling and hang motionless in the air.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEMOURNINGSAGE\\nS natches of \\nthe Shade’s memories continued to flash through Eragon. A whirlwind of dark \\nevents and emotions overwhelmed him, making it impossible to think. Submerged \\nin the maelstrom, he knew neither who nor where he was. He was too weak to \\ncleanse himself of the alien presence that clouded his mind. Violent, cruel \\nimages from the Shade’s past exploded behind his eyes until his spirit cried \\nout in anguish at the bloody sights. \\nA pile of bodies \\nrose before him . . . innocents slaughtered by the Shade’s orders. He saw still \\nmore corpses—whole villages of them—taken from life by the sorcerer’s hand or \\nword. There was no escape from the carnage that surrounded him. He wavered like \\na candle flame, unable to withstand the tide of evil. He prayed for someone to \\nlift him out of the nightmare, but there was no one to guide him. If only he \\ncould remember what he was supposed to be: boy or man, villain or hero, Shade \\nor Rider; all was jumbled together in a meaningless frenzy. He was lost, \\ncompletely and utterly, in the roiling mass. \\nSuddenly a \\ncluster of his own memories burst through the dismal cloud left by the Shade’s \\nmalevolent mind. All the events since he had found Saphira’s egg came to him in \\nthe cold light of revelation. His accomplishments and failures were displayed \\nequally. He had lost much that was dear to him, yet fate had given him rare and \\ngreat gifts; for the first time, he was proud of simply who he was. As if in \\nresponse to his brief self-confidence, the Shade’s smothering blackness \\nassaulted him anew. His identity trailed into the void as uncertainty and fear \\nconsumed his perceptions. Who was he to think he could challenge the powers of \\nAlagaësia and live?\\n\\nHe fought \\nagainst the Shade’s sinister thoughts, weakly at first, then more strongly. He \\nwhispered words of the ancient language and found they gave him enough strength \\nto withstand the shadow blurring his mind. Though his defenses faltered \\ndangerously, he slowly began to draw his shattered consciousness into a small \\nbright shell around his core. Outside his mind he was aware of a pain so great \\nit threatened to blot out his very life, but something—or someone—seemed to \\nkeep it at bay.\\n\\nHe was still too \\nweak to clear his mind completely, but he was lucid enough to examine his \\nexperiences since Carvahall. Where would he go now . . . and who would show him \\nthe way? Without Brom, there was no one to guide or teach him. \\nCome to me.\\nHe recoiled at \\nthe touch of another consciousness—one so vast and powerful it was like a \\nmountain looming over him. This was who was blocking the pain, he realized. \\nLike Arya’s mind, music ran through this one: deep amber-gold chords that \\nthrobbed with magisterial melancholy. \\nFinally, he \\ndared ask,Who \\n. . . who are you?\\nOne who would \\nhelp.With a flicker of an unspoken thought, the Shade’s influence was \\nbrushed aside like an unwanted cobweb. Freed from the oppressive weight, Eragon \\nlet his mind expand until he touched a barrier beyond which he could not pass.I \\nhave protected you as best I can, but you are so far away I can do no more than \\nshield your sanity from the pain.\\nAgain:Who are you to \\ndo this?\\nThere was a low \\nrumble.I \\nam Osthato Chetowä, the Mourning Sage. And Togira Ikonoka, the Cripple Who Is \\nWhole. Come to me, Eragon, for I have answers to all you ask. You will not be \\nsafe until you find me.\\nBut how can I \\nfind you if I don’t know where you are?he asked, despairing.\\nTrust Arya and \\ngo with her to Ellesméra—I will be there. I have waited many seasons, so do not \\ndelay or it may soon be too late. . . . You are greater than you know, Eragon. \\nThink of what you have done and rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great \\nevil. You have wrought a deed no one else could. Many are in your debt.\\nThe stranger was \\nright; what he had accomplished was worthy of honor, of recognition. No matter \\nwhat his trials might be in the future, he was no longer just a pawn in the \\ngame of power. He had transcended that and was something else, something more. \\nHe had become what Ajihad wanted: an authority independent of any king or \\nleader.\\n\\nHe sensed \\napproval as he reached that conclusion.You are learning,said the Mourning Sage, \\ndrawing nearer. A vision passed from him to Eragon: a burst of color blossomed \\nin his mind, resolving into a stooped figure dressed in white, standing on a \\nsun-drenched stone cliff.It is time for you to rest, Eragon. When you wake, \\ndo not speak of me to anyone,said the figure kindly, face obscured by a \\nsilver nimbus. Remember, you must go to the elves. Now, sleep. . . .He \\nraised a hand, as if in benediction, and peace crept through Eragon.\\nHis last thought \\nwas that Brom would have been proud of him. \\n\\xa0\\n“Wake,” \\ncommanded the voice. “Awake, Eragon, for you have slept far too long.” He \\nstirred unwillingly, loath to listen. The warmth that surrounded him was too \\ncomfortable to leave. The voice sounded again. “Rise, Argetlam! You are \\nneeded!”\\nHe reluctantly forced \\nhis eyes open and found himself on a long bed, swathed in soft blankets. Angela \\nsat in a chair beside him, staring at his face intently. “How do you feel?” she \\nasked.\\nDisoriented and \\nconfused, he let his eyes roam over the small room. “I . . . I don’t know,” he \\nsaid, his mouth dry and sore.\\n“Then don’t \\nmove. You should conserve your strength,” said Angela, running a hand through \\nher curly hair. Eragon saw that she still wore her flanged armor. Why was that? \\nA fit of coughing made him dizzy, lightheaded, and ache all over. His feverish \\nlimbs felt heavy. Angela lifted a gilt horn from the floor and held it to his \\nlips. “Here, drink.”\\nCool mead ran \\ndown his throat, refreshing him. Warmth bloomed in his stomach and rose to his \\ncheeks. He coughed again, which worsened his throbbing head. How did I get \\nhere? There was a battle . . . we were losing . . . then Durza and . . .“Saphira!” \\nhe exclaimed, sitting upright. He sagged back as his head swam and clenched his \\neyes, feeling sick. “What about Saphira? Is she all right? The Urgals were \\nwinning . . . she was falling. And Arya!”\\n“They lived,” \\nassured Angela, “and have been waiting for you to wake. Do you wish to see \\nthem?” He nodded feebly. Angela got up and threw open the door. Arya and \\nMurtagh filed inside. Saphira snaked her head into the room after them, her \\nbody too big to fit through the doorway. Her chest vibrated as she hummed \\ndeeply, eyes sparkling.\\nSmiling, Eragon \\ntouched her thoughts with relief and gratitude.It is good to see you well, \\nlittle one, she said tenderly.\\nAnd you too, but \\nhow—?\\n\\nThe others want \\nto explain it, so I will let them. \\nYou breathed \\nfire!I saw you!\\n\\nYes,she said with \\npride.\\nHe smiled \\nweakly, still confused, then looked at Arya and Murtagh. Both of them were \\nbandaged: Arya on her arm, Murtagh around his head. Murtagh grinned widely. \\n“About time you were up. We’ve been sitting in the hall for hours.”\\n“What . . . what \\nhappened?” asked Eragon.\\nArya looked sad. \\nBut Murtagh crowed, “We won! It was incredible! When the Shade’s spirits—if \\nthat’s what they were—flew across Farthen Dûr, the Urgals ceased fighting to \\nwatch them go. It was as though they were released from a spell then, because \\ntheir clans suddenly turned and attacked each other. Their entire army \\ndisintegrated within minutes. We routed them after that!”\\n“They’re all \\ndead?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head. “No, many of them escaped into the tunnels. The Varden and dwarves \\nare busy ferreting them out right now, but it’s going to take a while. I was \\nhelping until an Urgal banged me on the head and I was sent back here.”\\n“They aren’t \\ngoing to lock you up again?”\\nHis face grew \\nsober. “No one really cares about that right now. A lot of Varden and dwarves \\nwere killed; the survivors are busy trying to recover from the battle. But at \\nleast you have cause to be happy. You’re a hero! Everyone’s talking about how \\nyou killed Durza. If it hadn’t been for you, we would have lost.”\\nEragon was \\ntroubled by his words but pushed them away for later consideration. “Where were \\nthe Twins? They weren’t where they were supposed to be—I couldn’t contact them. \\nI needed their help.”\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “I was told they bravely fought off a group of Urgals that broke into \\nTronjheim somewhere else. They were probably too busy to talk with you.”\\nThat seemed \\nwrong for some reason, but Eragon could not decide why. He turned to Arya. Her \\nlarge bright eyes had been fixed upon him the entire time. “How come you didn’t \\ncrash? You and Saphira were . . .” His voice trailed off.\\nShe said slowly, \\n“When you warned Saphira of Durza, I was still trying to remove her damaged \\narmor. By the time it was off, it was too late to slide down Vol Turin—you \\nwould have been captured before I reached the bottom. Besides, Durza would have \\nkilled you before letting me rescue you.” Regret entered her voice, “So I did \\nthe one thing I could to distract him: I broke the star sapphire.”\\nAnd I carried \\nher down,added \\nSaphira.\\nEragon struggled \\nto understand as another bout of lightheadedness made him close his eyes. “But \\nwhy didn’t any of the pieces hit you or me?”\\n“I didn’t allow \\nthem to. When we were almost to the floor, I held them motionless in the air, \\nthen slowly lowered them to the floor—else they would have shattered into a \\nthousand pieces and killed you,” stated Arya simply. Her words betrayed the \\npower within her.\\nAngela added \\nsourly, “Yes, and it almost killed you as well. It’s taken all of my skill to \\nkeep the two of you alive.”\\nA twinge of \\nunease shot through Eragon, matching the intensity of his throbbing head.My \\nback . . . But he felt no bandages there. “How long have I been here?” he \\nasked with trepidation.\\n“Only a day and \\na half,” answered Angela. “You’re lucky I was around, otherwise it would’ve \\ntaken you weeks to heal—if you had even lived.” Alarmed, Eragon pushed the \\nblankets off his torso and twisted around to feel his back. Angela caught his \\nwrist with her small hand, worry reflected in her eyes. “Eragon . . . you have \\nto understand, my power is not like yours or Arya’s. It depends on the use of \\nherbs and potions. There are limits to what I can do, especially with such a \\nlarge—”\\nHe yanked his \\nhand out of her grip and reached back, fingers groping. The skin on his back \\nwas smooth and warm, flawless. Hard muscles flexed under his fingertips as he \\nmoved. He slid his hand toward the base of his neck and unexpectedly felt a \\nhard bump about a half-inch wide. He followed it down his back with growing \\nhorror. Durza’s blow had left him with a huge, ropy scar, stretching from his \\nright shoulder to the opposite hip.\\nPity showed on \\nArya’s face as she murmured, “You have paid a terrible price for your deed, \\nEragon Shadeslayer.”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nharshly. “Yes. Now you’re just like me.”\\nDismay filled \\nEragon, and he closed his eyes. He was disfigured. Then he remembered something \\nfrom when he was unconscious . . . a figure in white who had helped him. A \\ncripple who was whole—Togira Ikonoka. He had said,Think of what you have \\ndone and rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great evil. You have wrought a \\ndeed no one else could. Many are in your debt. . . .\\nCome to me \\nEragon, for I have answers to all you ask. \\nA measure of \\npeace and satisfaction consoled Eragon.\\nI will come. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nEND OFBOOKONE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTHE STORY WILL CONTINUE IN\\nEldest, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nBOOKTWO OFINHERITANCE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nP RONUNCIATION\\n\\nAjihad—AH-zhi-hod\\nAlagaësia—al-uh-GAY-zee-uh\\nArya—AR-ee-uh\\nCarvahall—CAR-vuh-hall\\nDras-Leona—DRAHS-lee-OH-nuh\\nDu \\nWeldenvarden—doo WELL-den-VAR-den\\nEragon—EHR-uh-gahn\\nFarthen \\nDûr—FAR-then DURE (durerhymes withlure )\\nGalbatorix—gal-buh-TOR-icks\\nGil’ead—GILL-ee-id\\nJeod—JODE \\n(rhymes withload )\\nMurtagh—MUR-tag \\n(murrhymes withpurr )\\nRa’zac—RAA-zack\\nSaphira—suh-FEAR-uh\\nShruikan—SHREW-kin\\nTeirm—TEERM\\nTronjheim—TRONJ-heem\\nVrael—VRAIL\\nYazuac—YA-zoo-ack\\nZar’roc—ZAR-rock\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nIcreatedEragon, \\nbut its success is the result of the enthusiastic efforts of friends, family, \\nfans, librarians, teachers, students, school administrators, distributors, \\nbooksellers, and many more. I wish I could mention by name all the people who \\nhave helped, but the list is very, very long. You know who you are, and I thank \\nyou!\\nEragonwas first \\npublished in early 2002 by my parents’ publishing company, Paolini \\nInternational LLC. They had already released three books, so it was only \\nnatural to do the same withEragon . We knewEragon would appeal to \\na wide range of readers; our challenge was to spread the word about it.\\nDuring 2002 and \\nthe beginning of 2003, I traveled throughout the United States doing over 130 \\nbook signings and presentations in schools, bookstores, and libraries. My \\nmother and I arranged all the events. At first I had only one or two \\nappearances per month, but as we became more efficient at scheduling, our \\nhomemade book tour expanded to the point where I was on the road almost \\ncontinuously.\\nI met thousands \\nof wonderful people, many of whom became loyal fans and friends. One of those \\nfans is Michelle Frey, now my editor at Knopf Books for Young Readers, who \\napproached me with an offer to acquireEragon . Needless to say, I was \\ndelighted that Knopf was interested in my book.\\nThus, there are \\ntwo groups of people who deserve thanks. The first assisted with the production \\nof the Paolini International LLC edition ofEragon, while the second is \\nresponsible for the Knopf edition.\\nHere are the \\nbrave souls who helped bringEragon into existence:\\n\\xa0\\nThe original \\ngang: my mother for her thoughtful red pen and wonderful help with commas, \\ncolons, semicolons, and other assorted beasties; my father for his smashing \\nediting job, all the time he spent hammering my vague, wayward thoughts into \\nline, formatting the book and designing the cover, and listening to so many \\npresentations; Grandma Shirley for helping me create a satisfactory beginning \\nand ending; my sister for her plot advice, her good humor at being portrayed as \\nan herbalist inEragon, and her long hours Photoshopping Saphira’s eye on \\nthe cover; Kathy Tyers for giving me the means to do a brutal—and \\nmuch-needed—rewrite of the first three chapters; John Taliaferro for his advice \\nand wonderful review; a fan named Tornado—Eugene Walker—who caught a number of \\ncopyediting errors; and Donna Overall for her love of the story, editing and \\nformatting advice, and keen eye for all things concerning ellipses, em dashes, \\nwidows, orphans, kerning, and run-on sentences. If there’s a real-life Dragon \\nRider, she’s one—selflessly coming to the rescue of writers lost in the Swamp \\nof Commas. And I thank my family for supporting me wholeheartedly . . . and for \\nreading this saga more times than any sane person should have to.\\n\\xa0\\nThe new gang: Michelle \\nFrey, who not only loved the story enough to take a chance on an epic fantasy \\nwritten by a teenager but also managed to streamlineEragon ’s pacing \\nthrough her insightful editing; my agent, Simon Lipskar, who helped find the \\nbest home forEragon; Chip Gibson and Beverly Horowitz for the wonderful \\noffer; Lawrence Levy for his good humor and legal advice; Judith Haut, \\npublicity whiz of the first degree; Daisy Kline for the awe-inspiring marketing \\ncampaign; Isabel Warren-Lynch, who designed the lovely book jacket, interior, \\nand map; John Jude Palencar, who painted the jacket art (I actually named \\nPalancar Valley for him long before he ever worked onEragon ); Artie \\nBennett, the doyen of copyediting and the only man alive who understood the \\ndifference betweento scry it andto scry on it; and the entire \\nteam at Knopf who have made this adventure possible.\\n\\xa0\\nLastly, a very \\nspecial thanks to my characters, who bravely face the dangers I force them to \\nconfront, and without whom I wouldn’t have a story.\\n\\xa0\\nMay your swords \\nstay sharp!\\n\\xa0\\nChristopher \\nPaolini\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA BOUT THE AUTHOR\\nChristopher \\nPaolini’s abiding love of fantasy and science fiction inspired him to begin \\nwriting his debut novel,Eragon, when he graduated from high school at \\nfifteen. Now nineteen, he lives with his family in Paradise Valley, Montana, \\nwhere he is at work onEldest, the next volume in the Inheritance \\ntrilogy.\\nYou can find out \\nmore about Christopher,Eragon, and Inheritance atwww.alagaesia.com .\\n\\n\\n'"

A tall Shade \\nlifted his head and sniffed the air. He looked human except for his crimson \\nhair and maroon eyes.\\nHe blinked in \\nsurprise. The message had been correct: they were here. Or was it a trap? He \\nweighed the odds, then said icily, “Spread out; hide behind trees and bushes. \\nStop whoever is coming . . . or die.”\\nAround him \\nshuffled twelve Urgals with short swords and round iron shields painted with \\nblack symbols. They resembled men with bowed legs and thick, brutish arms made \\nfor crushing. A pair of twisted horns grew above their small ears. The monsters \\nhurried into the brush, grunting as they hid. Soon the rustling quieted and the \\nforest was silent again.\\nThe Shade peered \\naround a thick tree and looked up the trail. It was too dark for any human to \\nsee, but for him the faint moonlight was like sunshine streaming between the \\ntrees; every detail was clear and sharp to his searching gaze. He remained \\nunnaturally quiet, a long pale sword in his hand. A wire-thin scratch curved \\ndown the blade. The weapon was thin enough to slip between a pair of ribs, yet \\nstout enough to hack through the hardest armor.\\nThe Urgals could \\nnot see as well as the Shade; they groped like blind beggars, fumbling with \\ntheir weapons. An owl screeched, cutting through the silence. No one relaxed \\nuntil the bird flew past. Then the monsters shivered in the cold night; one \\nsnapped a twig with his heavy boot. The Shade hissed in anger, and the Urgals \\nshrank back, motionless. He suppressed his distaste—they smelled like fetid \\nmeat—and turned away. They were tools, nothing more.\\nThe Shade forced \\nback his impatience as the minutes became hours. The scent must have wafted far \\nahead of its owners. He did not let the Urgals get up or warm themselves. He \\ndenied himself those luxuries, too, and stayed behind the tree, watching the \\ntrail. Another gust of wind rushed through the forest. The smell was stronger \\nthis time. Excited, he lifted a thin lip in a snarl.\\n“Get ready,” he \\nwhispered, his whole body vibrating. The tip of his sword moved in small \\ncircles. It had taken many plots and much pain to bring himself to this moment. \\nIt would not do to lose control now.\\nEyes brightened \\nunder the Urgals’ thick brows, and the creatures gripped their weapons tighter. \\nAhead of them, the Shade heard a clink as something hard struck a loose stone. \\nFaint smudges emerged from the darkness and advanced down the trail.\\nThree white \\nhorses with riders cantered toward the ambush, their heads held high and proud, \\ntheir coats rippling in the moonlight like liquid silver.\\nOn the first \\nhorse was an elf with pointed ears and elegantly slanted eyebrows. His build \\nwas slim but strong, like a rapier. A powerful bow was slung on his back. A \\nsword pressed against his side opposite a quiver of arrows fletched with swan \\nfeathers.\\nThe last rider \\nhad the same fair face and angled features as the other. He carried a long \\nspear in his right hand and a white dagger at his belt. A helm of extraordinary \\ncraftsmanship, wrought with amber and gold, rested on his head.\\nBetween these \\ntwo rode a raven-haired elven lady, who surveyed her surroundings with poise. \\nFramed by long black locks, her deep eyes shone with a driving force. Her \\nclothes were unadorned, yet her beauty was undiminished. At her side was a \\nsword, and on her back a long bow with a quiver. She carried in her lap a pouch \\nthat she frequently looked at, as if to reassure herself that it was still \\nthere.\\nOne of the elves \\nspoke quietly, but the Shade could not hear what was said. The lady answered \\nwith obvious authority, and her guards switched places. The one wearing the \\nhelm took the lead, shifting his spear to a readier grip. They passed the \\nShade’s hiding place and the first few Urgals without suspicion.\\nThe Shade was \\nalready savoring his victory when the wind changed direction and swept toward \\nthe elves, heavy with the Urgals’ stench. The horses snorted with alarm and \\ntossed their heads. The riders stiffened, eyes flashing from side to side, then \\nwheeled their mounts around and galloped away.\\nThe lady’s horse \\nsurged forward, leaving her guards far behind. Forsaking their hiding, the \\nUrgals stood and released a stream of black arrows. The Shade jumped out from \\nbehind the tree, raised his right hand, and shouted, “Garjzla!”\\nA red bolt \\nflashed from his palm toward the elven lady, illuminating the trees with a \\nbloody light. It struck her steed, and the horse toppled with a high-pitched \\nsqueal, plowing into the ground chest-first. She leapt off the animal with \\ninhuman speed, landed lightly, then glanced back for her guards.\\nThe Urgals’ \\ndeadly arrows quickly brought down the two elves. They fell from the noble \\nhorses, blood pooling in the dirt. As the Urgals rushed to the slain elves, the \\nShade screamed, “After her! She is the one I want!” The monsters grunted and \\nrushed down the trail.\\nA cry tore from \\nthe elf’s lips as she saw her dead companions. She took a step toward them, \\nthen cursed her enemies and bounded into the forest.\\nWhile the Urgals \\ncrashed through the trees, the Shade climbed a piece of granite that jutted \\nabove them. From his perch he could see all of the surrounding forest. He \\nraised his hand and uttered, “Böetq istalri!” and a quarter-mile section of the \\nforest exploded into flames. Grimly he burned one section after another until \\nthere was a ring of fire, a half-league across, around the ambush site. The \\nflames looked like a molten crown resting on the forest. Satisfied, he watched \\nthe ring carefully, in case it should falter.\\nThe band of fire \\nthickened, contracting the area the Urgals had to search. Suddenly, the Shade \\nheard shouts and a coarse scream. Through the trees he saw three of his charges \\nfall in a pile, mortally wounded. He caught a glimpse of the elf running from \\nthe remaining Urgals.\\nShe fled toward \\nthe craggy piece of granite at a tremendous speed. The Shade examined the \\nground twenty feet below, then jumped and landed nimbly in front of her. She \\nskidded around and sped back to the trail. Black Urgal blood dripped from her \\nsword, staining the pouch in her hand.\\nThe horned \\nmonsters came out of the forest and hemmed her in, blocking the only escape \\nroutes. Her head whipped around as she tried to find a way out. Seeing none, \\nshe drew herself up with regal disdain. The Shade approached her with a raised \\nhand, allowing himself to enjoy her helplessness.\\n“Get her.”\\nAs the Urgals \\nsurged forward, the elf pulled open the pouch, reached into it, and then let it \\ndrop to the ground. In her hands was a large sapphire stone that reflected the \\nangry light of the fires. She raised it over her head, lips forming frantic \\nwords. Desperate, the Shade barked, “Garjzla!”\\nA ball of red \\nflame sprang from his hand and flew toward the elf, fast as an arrow. But he \\nwas too late. A flash of emerald light briefly illuminated the forest, and the \\nstone vanished. Then the red fire smote her and she collapsed.\\nThe Shade howled \\nin rage and stalked forward, flinging his sword at a tree. It passed halfway \\nthrough the trunk, where it stuck, quivering. He shot nine bolts of energy from \\nhis palm—which killed the Urgals instantly—then ripped his sword free and \\nstrode to the elf.\\nProphecies of \\nrevenge, spoken in a wretched language only he knew, rolled from his tongue. He \\nclenched his thin hands and glared at the sky. The cold stars stared back, \\nunwinking, otherworldly watchers. Disgust curled his lip before he turned back \\nto the unconscious elf.\\nHer beauty, \\nwhich would have entranced any mortal man, held no charm for him. He confirmed \\nthat the stone was gone, then retrieved his horse from its hiding place among \\nthe trees. After tying the elf onto the saddle, he mounted the charger and made \\nhis way out of the woods.\\nHe quenched the \\nfires in his path but left the rest to burn.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 7': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nDISCOVERY \\nEragon knelt in a \\nbed of trampled reed grass and scanned the tracks with a practiced eye. The \\nprints told him that the deer had been in the meadow only a half-hour before. \\nSoon they would bed down. His target, a small doe with a pronounced limp in her \\nleft forefoot, was still with the herd. He was amazed she had made it so far \\nwithout a wolf or bear catching her.\\nThe sky was \\nclear and dark, and a slight breeze stirred the air. A silvery cloud drifted \\nover the mountains that surrounded him, its edges glowing with ruddy light cast \\nfrom the harvest moon cradled between two peaks. Streams flowed down the \\nmountains from stolid glaciers and glistening snowpacks. A brooding mist crept \\nalong the valley’s floor, almost thick enough to obscure his feet.\\nEragon was fifteen, \\nless than a year from manhood. Dark eyebrows rested above his intense brown \\neyes. His clothes were worn from work. A hunting knife with a bone handle was \\nsheathed at his belt, and a buckskin tube protected his yew bow from the mist. \\nHe carried a wood-frame pack.\\nThe deer had led \\nhim deep into the Spine, a range of untamed mountains that extended up and down \\nthe land of Alagaësia. Strange tales and men often came from those mountains, \\nusually boding ill. Despite that, Eragon did not fear the Spine—he was the only \\nhunter near Carvahall who dared track game deep into its craggy recesses.\\nIt was the third \\nnight of the hunt, and his food was half gone. If he did not fell the doe, he \\nwould be forced to return home empty-handed. His family needed the meat for the \\nrapidly approaching winter and could not afford to buy it in Carvahall.\\nEragon stood \\nwith quiet assurance in the dusky moonlight, then strode into the forest toward \\na glen where he was sure the deer would rest. The trees blocked the sky from \\nview and cast feathery shadows on the ground. He looked at the tracks only \\noccasionally; he knew the way.\\nAt the glen, he \\nstrung his bow with a sure touch, then drew three arrows and nocked one, \\nholding the others in his left hand. The moonlight revealed twenty or so \\nmotionless lumps where the deer lay in the grass. The doe he wanted was at the \\nedge of the herd, her left foreleg stretched out awkwardly.\\nEragon slowly \\ncrept closer, keeping the bow ready. All his work of the past three days had \\nled to this moment. He took a last steadying breath and—an explosion shattered \\nthe night.\\nThe herd bolted. \\nEragon lunged forward, racing through the grass as a fiery wind surged past his \\ncheek. He slid to a stop and loosed an arrow at the bounding doe. It missed by \\na finger’s breadth and hissed into darkness. He cursed and spun around, \\ninstinctively nocking another arrow.\\nBehind him, \\nwhere the deer had been, smoldered a large circle of grass and trees. Many of \\nthe pines stood bare of their needles. The grass outside the charring was \\nflattened. A wisp of smoke curled in the air, carrying a burnt smell. In the \\ncenter of the blast radius lay a polished blue stone. Mist snaked across the \\nscorched area and swirled insubstantial tendrils over the stone.\\nEragon watched \\nfor danger for several long minutes, but the only thing that moved was the \\nmist. Cautiously, he released the tension from his bow and moved forward. \\nMoonlight cast him in pale shadow as he stopped before the stone. He nudged it \\nwith an arrow, then jumped back. Nothing happened, so he warily picked it up.\\nNature had never \\npolished a stone as smooth as this one. Its flawless surface was dark blue, \\nexcept for thin veins of white that spiderwebbed across it. The stone was cool \\nand frictionless under his fingers, like hardened silk. Oval and about a foot \\nlong, it weighed several pounds, though it felt lighter than it should have.\\nEragon found the \\nstone both beautiful and frightening.Where did it come from? Does it have a \\npurpose? Then a more disturbing thought came to him:Was it sent here by \\naccident, or am I meant to have it? If he had learned anything from the old \\nstories, it was to treat magic, and those who used it, with great caution.\\nBut what should \\nI do with the stone?It \\nwould be tiresome to carry, and there was a chance it was dangerous. It might \\nbe better to leave it behind. A flicker of indecision ran through him, and he \\nalmost dropped it, but something stayed his hand.At the very least, it might \\npay for some food, he decided with a shrug, tucking the stone into his \\npack.\\nThe glen was too \\nexposed to make a safe camp, so he slipped back into the forest and spread his \\nbedroll beneath the upturned roots of a fallen tree. After a cold dinner of \\nbread and cheese, he wrapped himself in blankets and fell asleep, pondering \\nwhat had occurred.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 8': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nP ALANCARVALLEY\\nThe sun rose the \\nnext morning with a glorious conflagration of pink and yellow. The air was \\nfresh, sweet, and very cold. Ice edged the streams, and small pools were \\ncompletely frozen over. After a breakfast of porridge, Eragon returned to the \\nglen and examined the charred area. The morning light revealed no new details, \\nso he started for home.\\nThe rough game \\ntrail was faintly worn and, in places, nonexistent. Because it had been forged \\nby animals, it often backtracked and took long detours. Yet for all its flaws, \\nit was still the fastest way out of the mountains.\\nThe Spine was \\none of the only places that King Galbatorix could not call his own. Stories \\nwere still told about how half his army disappeared after marching into its \\nancient forest. A cloud of misfortune and bad luck seemed to hang over it. \\nThough the trees grew tall and the sky shone brightly, few people could stay in \\nthe Spine for long without suffering an accident. Eragon was one of those \\nfew—not through any particular gift, it seemed to him, but because of \\npersistent vigilance and sharp reflexes. He had hiked in the mountains for \\nyears, yet he was still wary of them. Every time he thought they had surrendered \\ntheir secrets, something happened to upset his understanding of them—like the \\nstone’s appearance.\\nHe kept up a \\nbrisk pace, and the leagues steadily disappeared. In late evening he arrived at \\nthe edge of a precipitous ravine. The Anora River rushed by far below, heading \\nto Palancar Valley. Gorged with hundreds of tiny streams, the river was a brute \\nforce, battling against the rocks and boulders that barred its way. A low \\nrumble filled the air.\\nHe camped in a \\nthicket near the ravine and watched the moonrise before going to bed.\\n\\xa0\\nIt grew colder \\nover the next day and a half. Eragon traveled quickly and saw little of the \\nwary wildlife. A bit past noon, he heard the Igualda Falls blanketing \\neverything with the dull sound of a thousand splashes. The trail led him onto a \\nmoist slate outcropping, which the river sped past, flinging itself into empty \\nair and down mossy cliffs.\\nBefore him lay \\nPalancar Valley, exposed like an unrolled map. The base of the Igualda Falls, \\nmore than a half-mile below, was the northernmost point of the valley. A little \\nways from the falls was Carvahall, a cluster of brown buildings. White smoke \\nrose from the chimneys, defiant of the wilderness around it. At this height, \\nfarms were small square patches no bigger than the end of his finger. The land \\naround them was tan or sandy, where dead grass swayed in the wind. The Anora \\nRiver wound from the falls toward Palancar’s southern end, reflecting great \\nstrips of sunlight. Far in the distance it flowed past the village Therinsford \\nand the lonely mountain Utgard. Beyond that, he knew only that it turned north \\nand ran to the sea.\\nAfter a pause, \\nEragon left the outcropping and started down the trail, grimacing at the \\ndescent. When he arrived at the bottom, soft dusk was creeping over everything, \\nblurring colors and shapes into gray masses. Carvahall’s lights shimmered \\nnearby in the twilight; the houses cast long shadows. Aside from Therinsford, \\nCarvahall was the only village in Palancar Valley. The settlement was secluded \\nand surrounded by harsh, beautiful land. Few traveled here except merchants and \\ntrappers.\\nThe village was \\ncomposed of stout log buildings with low roofs—some thatched, others shingled. \\nSmoke billowed from the chimneys, giving the air a woody smell. The buildings \\nhad wide porches where people gathered to talk and conduct business. \\nOccasionally a window brightened as a candle or lamp was lit. Eragon heard men \\ntalking loudly in the evening air while wives scurried to fetch their husbands, \\nscolding them for being late.\\nEragon wove his \\nway between the houses to the butcher’s shop, a broad, thick-beamed building. \\nOverhead, the chimney belched black smoke.\\nHe pushed the \\ndoor open. The spacious room was warm and well lit by a fire snapping in a \\nstone fireplace. A bare counter stretched across the far side of the room. The \\nfloor was strewn with loose straw. Everything was scrupulously clean, as if the \\nowner spent his leisure time digging in obscure crannies for minuscule pieces \\nof filth. Behind the counter stood the butcher Sloan. A small man, he wore a \\ncotton shirt and a long, bloodstained smock. An impressive array of knives \\nswung from his belt. He had a sallow, pockmarked face, and his black eyes were \\nsuspicious. He polished the counter with a ragged cloth.\\nSloan’s mouth \\ntwisted as Eragon entered. “Well, the mighty hunter joins the rest of us \\nmortals. How many did you bag this time?”\\n“None,” was \\nEragon’s curt reply. He had never liked Sloan. The butcher always treated him \\nwith disdain, as if he were something unclean. A widower, Sloan seemed to care \\nfor only one person—his daughter, Katrina, on whom he doted.\\n“I’m amazed,” \\nsaid Sloan with affected astonishment. He turned his back on Eragon to scrape \\nsomething off the wall. “And that’s your reason for coming here?”\\n“Yes,” admitted \\nEragon uncomfortably.\\n“If that’s the \\ncase, let’s see your money.” Sloan tapped his fingers when Eragon shifted his \\nfeet and remained silent. “Come on—either you have it or you don’t. Which is \\nit?”\\n“I don’t really \\nhave any money, but I do—”\\n“What, no \\nmoney?” the butcher cut him off sharply. “And you expect to buy meat! Are the \\nother merchants giving away their wares? Should I just hand you the goods \\nwithout charge? Besides,” he said abruptly, “it’s late. Come back tomorrow with \\nmoney. I’m closed for the day.”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim. “I can’t wait until tomorrow, Sloan. It’ll be worth your while, though; I \\nfound something to pay you with.” He pulled out the stone with a flourish and \\nset it gently on the scarred counter, where it gleamed with light from the \\ndancing flames.\\n“Stole it is \\nmore likely,” muttered Sloan, leaning forward with an interested expression.\\nIgnoring the \\ncomment, Eragon asked, “Will this be enough?”\\nSloan picked up \\nthe stone and gauged its weight speculatively. He ran his hands over its \\nsmoothness and inspected the white veins. With a calculating look, he set it \\ndown. “It’s pretty, but how much is it worth?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nadmitted Eragon, “but no one would have gone to the trouble of shaping it \\nunless it had some value.”\\n“Obviously,” said \\nSloan with exaggerated patience. “But how much value? Since you don’t know, I \\nsuggest that you find a trader who does, or take my offer of three crowns.”\\n“That’s a \\nmiser’s bargain! It must be worth at least ten times that,” protested Eragon. \\nThree crowns would not even buy enough meat to last a week.\\nSloan shrugged. \\n“If you don’t like my offer, wait until the traders arrive. Either way, I’m \\ntired of this conversation.”\\nThe traders were \\na nomadic group of merchants and entertainers who visited Carvahall every \\nspring and winter. They bought whatever excess the villagers and local farmers \\nhad managed to grow or make, and sold what they needed to live through another \\nyear: seeds, animals, fabric, and supplies like salt and sugar.\\nBut Eragon did \\nnot want to wait until they arrived; it could be a while, and his family needed \\nthe meat now. “Fine, I accept,” he snapped.\\n“Good, I’ll get \\nyou the meat. Not that it matters, but where did you find this?”\\n“Two nights ago \\nin the Spine—”\\n“Get out!” \\ndemanded Sloan, pushing the stone away. He stomped furiously to the end of the \\ncounter and started scrubbing old bloodstains off a knife.\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon. He drew the stone closer, as if to protect it from Sloan’s wrath.\\n“I won’t deal \\nwith anything you bring back from those damned mountains! Take your sorcerer’s \\nstone elsewhere.” Sloan’s hand suddenly slipped and he cut a finger on the \\nknife, but he seemed not to notice. He continued to scrub, staining the blade \\nwith fresh blood.\\n“You refuse to \\nsell to me!”\\n“Yes! Unless you \\npay with coins,” Sloan growled, and hefted the knife, sidling away. “Go, before \\nI make you!”\\nThe door behind \\nthem slammed open. Eragon whirled around, ready for more trouble. In stomped \\nHorst, a hulking man. Sloan’s daughter, Katrina—a tall girl of sixteen—trailed \\nbehind him with a determined expression. Eragon was surprised to see her; she \\nusually absented herself from any arguments involving her father. Sloan glanced \\nat them warily, then started to accuse Eragon. “He won’t—”\\n“Quiet,” \\nannounced Horst in a rumbling voice, cracking his knuckles at the same time. He \\nwas Carvahall’s smith, as his thick neck and scarred leather apron attested. \\nHis powerful arms were bare to the elbow; a great expanse of hairy muscular \\nchest was visible through the top of his shirt. A black beard, carelessly \\ntrimmed, roiled and knotted like his jaw muscles. “Sloan, what have you done \\nnow?”\\n“Nothing.” He \\ngave Eragon a murderous gaze, then spat, “This . . .boy came in here and \\nstarted badgering me. I asked him to leave, but he won’t budge. I even \\nthreatened him and he still ignored me!” Sloan seemed to shrink as he looked at \\nHorst.\\n“Is this true?” \\ndemanded the smith.\\n“No!” replied \\nEragon. “I offered this stone as payment for some meat, and he accepted it. \\nWhen I told him that I’d found it in the Spine, he refused to even touch it. \\nWhat difference does it make where it came from?”\\nHorst looked at \\nthe stone curiously, then returned his attention to the butcher. “Why won’t you \\ntrade with him, Sloan? I’ve no love for the Spine myself, but if it’s a \\nquestion of the stone’s worth, I’ll back it with my own money.”\\nThe question \\nhung in the air for a moment. Then Sloan licked his lips and said, “This is my \\nown store. I can do whatever I want.”\\nKatrina stepped \\nout from behind Horst and tossed back her auburn hair like a spray of molten \\ncopper. “Father, Eragonis willing to pay. Give him the meat, and then we \\ncan have supper.”\\nSloan’s eyes \\nnarrowed dangerously. “Go back to the house; this is none of your business. . . \\n. I saidgo !” Katrina’s face hardened, then she marched out of the room \\nwith a stiff back.\\nEragon watched \\nwith disapproval but dared not interfere. Horst tugged at his beard before \\nsaying reproachfully, “Fine, you can deal with me. What were you going to get, \\nEragon?” His voice reverberated through the room.\\n“As much as I \\ncould.”\\nHorst pulled out \\na purse and counted out a pile of coins. “Give me your best roasts and steaks. \\nMake sure that it’s enough to fill Eragon’s pack.” The butcher hesitated, his \\ngaze darting between Horst and Eragon. “Not selling to me would be a very bad \\nidea,” stated Horst.\\nGlowering \\nvenomously, Sloan slipped into the back room. A frenzy of chopping, wrapping, \\nand low cursing reached them. After several uncomfortable minutes, he returned \\nwith an armful of wrapped meat. His face was expressionless as he accepted \\nHorst’s money, then proceeded to clean his knife, pretending that they were not \\nthere.\\nHorst scooped up \\nthe meat and walked outside. Eragon hurried behind him, carrying his pack and \\nthe stone. The crisp night air rolled over their faces, refreshing after the \\nstuffy shop.\\n“Thank you, \\nHorst. Uncle Garrow will be pleased.”\\nHorst laughed \\nquietly. “Don’t thank me. I’ve wanted to do that for a long time. Sloan’s a \\nvicious troublemaker; it does him good to be humbled. Katrina heard what was \\nhappening and ran to fetch me. Good thing I came—the two of you were almost at \\nblows. Unfortunately, I doubt he’ll serve you or any of your family the next \\ntime you go in there, even if you do have coins.”\\n“Why did he \\nexplode like that? We’ve never been friendly, but he’s always taken our money. \\nAnd I’ve never seen him treat Katrina that way,” said Eragon, opening the top \\nof the pack.\\nHorst shrugged. \\n“Ask your uncle. He knows more about it than I do.”\\nEragon stuffed \\nthe meat into his pack. “Well, now I have one more reason to hurry home . . . \\nto solve this mystery. Here, this is rightfully yours.” He proffered the stone.\\nHorst chuckled. \\n“No, you keep your strange rock. As for payment, Albriech plans to leave for \\nFeinster next spring. He wants to become a master smith, and I’m going to need \\nan assistant. You can come and work off the debt on your spare days.”\\nEragon bowed \\nslightly, delighted. Horst had two sons, Albriech and Baldor, both of whom \\nworked in his forge. Taking one’s place was a generous offer. “Again, thank \\nyou! I look forward to working with you.” He was glad that there was a way for \\nhim to pay Horst. His uncle would never accept charity. Then Eragon remembered \\nwhat his cousin had told him before he had left on the hunt. “Roran wanted me \\nto give Katrina a message, but since I can’t, can you get it to her?”\\n“Of course.”\\n“He wants her to \\nknow that he’ll come into town as soon as the merchants arrive and that he will \\nsee her then.”\\n“That all?”\\nEragon was \\nslightly embarrassed. “No, he also wants her to know that she is the most \\nbeautiful girl he has ever seen and that he thinks of nothing else.”\\nHorst’s face \\nbroke into a broad grin, and he winked at Eragon. “Getting serious, isn’t he?”\\n“Yes, sir,” \\nEragon answered with a quick smile. “Could you also give her my thanks? It was \\nnice of her to stand up to her father for me. I hope that she isn’t punished \\nbecause of it. Roran would be furious if I got her into trouble.”\\n“I wouldn’t \\nworry about it. Sloan doesn’t know that she called me, so I doubt he’ll be too \\nhard on her. Before you go, will you sup with us?”\\n“I’m sorry, but \\nI can’t. Garrow is expecting me,” said Eragon, tying off the top of the pack. \\nHe hoisted it onto his back and started down the road, raising his hand in \\nfarewell.\\nThe meat slowed \\nhim down, but he was eager to be home, and renewed vigor filled his steps. The \\nvillage ended abruptly, and he left its warm lights behind. The pearlescent \\nmoon peeked over the mountains, bathing the land in a ghostly reflection of \\ndaylight. Everything looked bleached and flat.\\nNear the end of \\nhis journey, he turned off the road, which continued south. A simple path led \\nstraight through waist-high grass and up a knoll, almost hidden by the shadows \\nof protective elm trees. He crested the hill and saw a gentle light shining \\nfrom his home.\\nThe house had a \\nshingled roof and a brick chimney. Eaves hung over the whitewashed walls, \\nshadowing the ground below. One side of the enclosed porch was filled with \\nsplit wood, ready for the fire. A jumble of farm tools cluttered the other \\nside.\\nThe house had \\nbeen abandoned for half a century when they moved in after Garrow’s wife, \\nMarian, died. It was ten miles from Carvahall, farther than anyone else’s. \\nPeople considered the distance dangerous because the family could not rely on \\nhelp from the village in times of trouble, but Eragon’s uncle would not listen.\\nA hundred feet \\nfrom the house, in a dull-colored barn, lived two horses—Birka and Brugh—with \\nchickens and a cow. Sometimes there was also a pig, but they had been unable to \\nafford one this year. A wagon sat wedged between the stalls. On the edge of \\ntheir fields, a thick line of trees traced along the Anora River.\\nHe saw a light \\nmove behind a window as he wearily reached the porch. “Uncle, it’s Eragon. Let \\nme in.” A small shutter slid back for a second, then the door swung inward.\\nGarrow stood \\nwith his hand on the door. His worn clothes hung on him like rags on a stick \\nframe. A lean, hungry face with intense eyes gazed out from under graying hair. \\nHe looked like a man who had been partly mummified before it was discovered \\nthat he was still alive. “Roran’s sleeping,” was his answer to Eragon’s \\ninquiring glance.\\nA lantern \\nflickered on a wood table so old that the grain stood up in tiny ridges like a \\ngiant fingerprint. Near a woodstove were rows of cooking utensils tacked onto \\nthe wall with homemade nails. A second door opened to the rest of the house. \\nThe floor was made of boards polished smooth by years of tramping feet.\\nEragon pulled \\noff his pack and took out the meat. “What’s this? Did you buy meat? Where did \\nyou get the money?” asked his uncle harshly as he saw the wrapped packages.\\nEragon took a \\nbreath before answering. “No, Horst bought it for us.”\\n“You let him pay \\nfor it? I told you before, I won’t beg for our food. If we can’t feed \\nourselves, we might as well move into town. Before you can turn around twice, \\nthey’ll be sending us used clothes and asking if we’ll be able to get through \\nthe winter.” Garrow’s face paled with anger.\\n“I didn’t accept \\ncharity,” snapped Eragon. “Horst agreed to let me work off the debt this \\nspring. He needs someone to help him because Albriech is going away.”\\n“And where will \\nyou get the time to work for him? Are you going to ignore all the things that \\nneed to be done here?” asked Garrow, forcing his voice down.\\nEragon hung his \\nbow and quiver on hooks beside the front door. “I don’t know how I’ll do it,” \\nhe said irritably. “Besides, I found something that could be worth some money.” \\nHe set the stone on the table.\\nGarrow bowed \\nover it: the hungry look on his face became ravenous, and his fingers moved \\nwith a strange twitch. “You found this in the Spine?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon. He explained what had happened. “And to make matters worse, I lost my \\nbest arrow. I’ll have to make more before long.” They stared at the stone in \\nthe near darkness.\\n“How was the \\nweather?” asked his uncle, lifting the stone. His hands tightened around it \\nlike he was afraid it would suddenly disappear.\\n“Cold,” was \\nEragon’s reply. “It didn’t snow, but it froze each night.”\\nGarrow looked \\nworried by the news. “Tomorrow you’ll have to help Roran finish harvesting the \\nbarley. If we can get the squash picked, too, the frost won’t bother us.” He \\npassed the stone to Eragon. “Here, keep it. When the traders come, we’ll find \\nout what it’s worth. Selling it is probably the best thing to do. The less \\nwe’re involved with magic, the better. . . . Why did Horst pay for the meat?”\\nIt took only a \\nmoment for Eragon to explain his argument with Sloan. “I just don’t understand \\nwhat angered him so.”\\nGarrow shrugged. \\n“Sloan’s wife, Ismira, went over the Igualda Falls a year before you were \\nbrought here. He hasn’t been near the Spine since, nor had anything to do with \\nit. But that’s no reason to refuse payment. I think he wanted to give you \\ntrouble.”\\nEragon swayed \\nblearily and said, “It’s good to be back.” Garrow’s eyes softened, and he \\nnodded. Eragon stumbled to his room, pushed the stone under his bed, then fell \\nonto the mattress.Home . For the first time since before the hunt, he \\nrelaxed completely as sleep overtook him.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 9': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD RAGONTALES\\nAt dawn the sun’s \\nrays streamed through the window, warming Eragon’s face. Rubbing his eyes, he \\nsat up on the edge of the bed. The pine floor was cold under his feet. He \\nstretched his sore legs and rubbed his back, yawning.\\nBeside the bed \\nwas a row of shelves covered with objects he had collected. There were twisted \\npieces of wood, odd bits of shells, rocks that had broken to reveal shiny \\ninteriors, and strips of dry grass tied into knots. His favorite item was a \\nroot so convoluted he never tired of looking at it. The rest of the room was \\nbare, except for a small dresser and nightstand.\\nHe pulled on his \\nboots and stared at the floor, thinking. This was a special day. It was near \\nthis very hour, sixteen years ago, that his mother, Selena, had come home to \\nCarvahall alone and pregnant. She had been gone for six years, living in the \\ncities. When she returned, she wore expensive clothes, and her hair was bound \\nby a net of pearls. She had sought out her brother, Garrow, and asked to stay \\nwith him until the baby arrived. Within five months her son was born. Everyone \\nwas shocked when Selena tearfully begged Garrow and Marian to raise him. When \\nthey asked why, she only wept and said, “I must.” Her pleas had grown \\nincreasingly desperate until they finally agreed. She named him Eragon, then \\ndeparted early the next morning and never returned.\\nEragon still \\nremembered how he had felt when Marian told him the story before she died. The \\nrealization that Garrow and Marian were not his real parents had disturbed him \\ngreatly. Things that had been permanent and unquestionable were suddenly thrown \\ninto doubt. Eventually he had learned to live with it, but he always had a nagging \\nsuspicion that he had not been good enough for his mother.I’m sure there was \\na good reason for what she did; I only wish I knew what it was.\\nOne other thing \\nbothered him: Who was his father? Selena had told no one, and whoever it might \\nbe had never come looking for Eragon. He wished that he knew who it was, if \\nonly to have a name. It would be nice to know his heritage.\\nHe sighed and \\nwent to the nightstand, where he splashed his face, shivering as the water ran \\ndown his neck. Refreshed, he retrieved the stone from under the bed and set it \\non a shelf. The morning light caressed it, throwing a warm shadow on the wall. \\nHe touched it one more time, then hurried to the kitchen, eager to see his \\nfamily. Garrow and Roran were already there, eating chicken. As Eragon greeted \\nthem, Roran stood with a grin.\\nRoran was two \\nyears older than Eragon, muscular, sturdy, and careful with his movements. They \\ncould not have been closer even if they had been real brothers.\\nRoran smiled. \\n“I’m glad you’re back. How was the trip?”\\n“Hard,” replied \\nEragon. “Did Uncle tell you what happened?” He helped himself to a piece of \\nchicken, which he devoured hungrily.\\n“No,” said \\nRoran, and the story was quickly told. At Roran’s insistence, Eragon left his \\nfood to show him the stone. This elicited a satisfactory amount of awe, but \\nRoran soon asked nervously, “Were you able to talk with Katrina?”\\n“No, there \\nwasn’t an opportunity after the argument with Sloan. But she’ll expect you when \\nthe traders come. I gave the message to Horst; he will get it to her.”\\n“You told \\nHorst?” said Roran incredulously. “That was private. If I wanted everyone to \\nknow about it, I could have built a bonfire and used smoke signals to \\ncommunicate. If Sloan finds out, he won’t let me see her again.”\\n“Horst will be \\ndiscreet,” assured Eragon. “He won’t let anyone fall prey to Sloan, least of \\nall you.” Roran seemed unconvinced, but argued no more. They returned to their \\nmeals in the taciturn presence of Garrow. When the last bites were finished, \\nall three went to work in the fields.\\nThe sun was cold \\nand pale, providing little comfort. Under its watchful eye, the last of the \\nbarley was stored in the barn. Next, they gathered prickly vined squash, then \\nthe rutabagas, beets, peas, turnips, and beans, which they packed into the root \\ncellar. After hours of labor, they stretched their cramped muscles, pleased \\nthat the harvest was finished.\\nThe following \\ndays were spent pickling, salting, shelling, and preparing the food for winter.\\nNine days after \\nEragon’s return, a vicious blizzard blew out of the mountains and settled over \\nthe valley. The snow came down in great sheets, blanketing the countryside in \\nwhite. They only dared leave the house for firewood and to feed the animals, \\nfor they feared getting lost in the howling wind and featureless landscape. \\nThey spent their time huddled over the stove as gusts rattled the heavy window \\nshutters. Days later the storm finally passed, revealing an alien world of soft \\nwhite drifts.\\n“I’m afraid the \\ntraders may not come this year, with conditions this bad,” said Garrow. \\n“They’re late as it is. We’ll give them a chance and wait before going to \\nCarvahall. But if they don’t show soon, we’ll have to buy any spare supplies \\nfrom the townspeople.” His countenance was resigned.\\nThey grew \\nanxious as the days crept by without sign of the traders. Talk was sparse, and \\ndepression hung over the house.\\nOn the eighth \\nmorning, Roran walked to the road and confirmed that the traders had not yet \\npassed. The day was spent readying for the trip into Carvahall, scrounging with \\ngrim expressions for saleable items. That evening, out of desperation, Eragon \\nchecked the road again. He found deep ruts cut into the snow, with numerous \\nhoofprints between them. Elated, he ran back to the house whooping, bringing \\nnew life to their preparations.\\n\\xa0\\nThey packed \\ntheir surplus produce into the wagon before sunrise. Garrow put the year’s \\nmoney in a leather pouch that he carefully fastened to his belt. Eragon set the \\nwrapped stone between bags of grain so it would not roll when the wagon hit \\nbumps.\\nAfter a hasty \\nbreakfast, they harnessed the horses and cleared a path to the road. The \\ntraders’ wagons had already broken the drifts, which sped their progress. By \\nnoon they could see Carvahall.\\nIn daylight, it \\nwas a small earthy village filled with shouts and laughter. The traders had \\nmade camp in an empty field on the outskirts of town. Groups of wagons, tents, \\nand fires were randomly spread across it, spots of color against the snow. The \\ntroubadours’ four tents were garishly decorated. A steady stream of people \\nlinked the camp to the village.\\nCrowds churned \\naround a line of bright tents and booths clogging the main street. Horses \\nwhinnied at the noise. The snow had been pounded flat, giving it a glassy \\nsurface; elsewhere, bonfires had melted it. Roasted hazelnuts added a rich \\naroma to the smells wafting around them.\\nGarrow parked \\nthe wagon and picketed the horses, then drew coins from his pouch. “Get \\nyourselves some treats. Roran, do what you want, only be at Horst’s in time for \\nsupper. Eragon, bring that stone and come with me.” Eragon grinned at Roran and \\npocketed the money, already planning how to spend it.\\nRoran departed \\nimmediately with a determined expression on his face. Garrow led Eragon into \\nthe throng, shouldering his way through the bustle. Women were buying cloth, \\nwhile nearby their husbands examined a new latch, hook, or tool. Children ran \\nup and down the road, shrieking with excitement. Knives were displayed here, \\nspices there, and pots were laid out in shiny rows next to leather harnesses.\\nEragon stared at \\nthe traders curiously. They seemed less prosperous than last year. Their \\nchildren had a frightened, wary look, and their clothes were patched. The gaunt \\nmen carried swords and daggers with a new familiarity, and even the women had \\nponiards belted at their waists.\\nWhat could have \\nhappened to make them like this? And why are they so late?wondered Eragon. \\nHe remembered the traders as being full of good cheer, but there was none of \\nthat now. Garrow pushed down the street, searching for Merlock, a trader who \\nspecialized in odd trinkets and pieces of jewelry.\\nThey found him \\nbehind a booth, displaying brooches to a group of women. As each new piece was \\nrevealed, exclamations of admiration followed. Eragon guessed that more than a \\nfew purses would soon be depleted. Merlock seemed to flourish and grow every \\ntime his wares were complimented. He wore a goatee, held himself with ease, and \\nseemed to regard the rest of the world with slight contempt.\\nThe excited \\ngroup prevented Garrow and Eragon from getting near the trader, so they settled \\non a step and waited. As soon as Merlock was unoccupied, they hurried over.\\n“And what might \\nyou sirs want to look at?” asked Merlock. “An amulet or trinket for a lady?” \\nWith a twirl he pulled out a delicately carved silver rose of excellent \\nworkmanship. The polished metal caught Eragon’s attention, and he eyed it \\nappreciatively. The trader continued, “Not even three crowns, though it has \\ncome all the way from the famed craftsmen of Belatona.”\\nGarrow spoke in \\na quiet voice. “We aren’t looking to buy, but to sell.” Merlock immediately \\ncovered the rose and looked at them with new interest.\\n“I see. Maybe, \\nif this item is of any value, you would like to trade it for one or two of \\nthese exquisite pieces.” He paused for a moment while Eragon and his uncle \\nstood uncomfortably, then continued, “You didbring the object of \\nconsideration?”\\n“We have it, but \\nwe would rather show it to you elsewhere,” said Garrow in a firm voice.\\nMerlock raised \\nan eyebrow, but spoke smoothly. “In that case, let me invite you to my tent.” \\nHe gathered up his wares and gently laid them in an iron-bound chest, which he \\nlocked. Then he ushered them up the street and into the temporary camp. They \\nwound between the wagons to a tent removed from the rest of the traders’. It \\nwas crimson at the top and sable at the bottom, with thin triangles of colors \\nstabbing into each other. Merlock untied the opening and swung the flap to one \\nside.\\nSmall trinkets \\nand strange pieces of furniture, such as a round bed and three seats carved \\nfrom tree stumps, filled the tent. A gnarled dagger with a ruby in the pommel \\nrested on a white cushion.\\nMerlock closed \\nthe flap and turned to them. “Please, seat yourselves.” When they had, he said, \\n“Now show me why we are meeting in private.” Eragon unwrapped the stone and set \\nit between the two men. Merlock reached for it with a gleam in his eye, then \\nstopped and asked, “May I?” When Garrow indicated his approval, Merlock picked \\nit up.\\nHe put the stone \\nin his lap and reached to one side for a thin box. Opened, it revealed a large \\nset of copper scales, which he set on the ground. After weighing the stone, he \\nscrutinized its surface under a jeweler’s glass, tapped it gently with a wooden \\nmallet, and drew the point of a tiny clear stone over it. He measured its \\nlength and diameter, then recorded the figures on a slate. He considered the \\nresults for a while. “Do you know what this is worth?”\\n“No,” admitted \\nGarrow. His cheek twitched, and he shifted uncomfortably on the seat.\\nMerlock \\ngrimaced. “Unfortunately, neither do I. But I can tell you this much: the white \\nveins are the same material as the blue that surrounds them, only a different \\ncolor. What that material might be, though, I haven’t a clue. It’s harder than \\nany rock I have seen, harder even than diamond. Whoever shaped it used tools I \\nhave never seen—or magic. Also, it’s hollow.”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed Garrow.\\nAn irritated \\nedge crept into Merlock’s voice. “Did you ever hear a rock sound like this?” He \\ngrabbed the dagger from the cushion and slapped the stone with the flat of the \\nblade. A pure note filled the air, then faded away smoothly. Eragon was \\nalarmed, afraid that the stone had been damaged. Merlock tilted the stone \\ntoward them. “You will find no scratches or blemishes where the dagger struck. \\nI doubt I could do anything to harm this stone, even if I took a hammer to it.”\\nGarrow crossed \\nhis arms with a reserved expression. A wall of silence surrounded him. Eragon \\nwas puzzled.I knew that the stone appeared in the Spine through magic, but \\nmade by magic? What for and why? He blurted, “But what is it worth?”\\n“I can’t tell \\nyou that,” said Merlock in a pained voice. “I am sure there are people who \\nwould pay dearly to have it, but none of them are in Carvahall. You would have \\nto go to the southern cities to find a buyer. This is a curiosity for most \\npeople—not an item to spend money on when practical things are needed.”\\nGarrow stared at \\nthe tent ceiling like a gambler calculating the odds. “Will you buy it?”\\nThe trader \\nanswered instantly, “It’s not worth the risk. I might be able to find a wealthy \\nbuyer during my spring travels, but I can’t be certain. Even if I did, you \\nwouldn’t be paid until I returned next year. No, you will have to find someone \\nelse to trade with. I am curious, however . . . Why did you insist on talking \\nto me in private?”\\nEragon put the \\nstone away before answering. “Because,” he glanced at the man, wondering if he \\nwould explode like Sloan, “I found this in the Spine, and folks around here \\ndon’t like that.”\\nMerlock gave him \\na startled look. “Do you know why my fellow merchants and I were late this \\nyear?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead.\\n“Our wanderings \\nhave been dogged with misfortune. Chaos seems to rule Alagaësia. We could not \\navoid illness, attacks, and the most cursed black luck. Because the Varden’s \\nattacks have increased, Galbatorix has forced cities to send more soldiers to \\nthe borders, men who are needed to combat the Urgals. The brutes have been \\nmigrating southeast, toward the Hadarac Desert. No one knows why and it \\nwouldn’t concern us, except that they’re passing through populated areas. \\nThey’ve been spotted on roads and near cities. Worst of all are reports of a \\nShade, though the stories are unconfirmed. Not many people survive such an \\nencounter.”\\n“Why haven’t we \\nheard of this?” cried Eragon.\\n“Because,” said \\nMerlock grimly, “it only began a few months ago. Whole villages have been \\nforced to move because Urgals destroyed their fields and starvation threatens.”\\n“Nonsense,” \\ngrowled Garrow. “We haven’t seen any Urgals; the only one around here has his \\nhorns mounted in Morn’s tavern.”\\nMerlock arched \\nan eyebrow. “Maybe so, but this is a small village hidden by mountains. It’s \\nnot surprising that you’ve escaped notice. However, I wouldn’t expect that to \\nlast. I only mentioned this because strange things are happening here as well \\nif you found such a stone in the Spine.” With that sobering statement, he bid \\nthem farewell with a bow and slight smile.\\nGarrow headed \\nback to Carvahall with Eragon trailing behind. “What do you think?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“I’m going to \\nget more information before I make up my mind. Take the stone back to the \\nwagon, then do what you want. I’ll meet you for dinner at Horst’s.”\\nEragon dodged \\nthrough the crowd and happily dashed back to the wagon. Trading would take his \\nuncle hours, time that he planned to enjoy fully. He hid the stone under the \\nbags, then set out into town with a cocky stride.\\nHe walked from \\none booth to another, evaluating the goods with a buyer’s eye, despite his \\nmeager supply of coins. When he talked with the merchants, they confirmed what \\nMerlock had said about the instability in Alagaësia. Over and over the message \\nwas repeated: last year’s security has deserted us; new dangers have appeared, \\nand nothing is safe.\\nLater in the day \\nhe bought three sticks of malt candy and a small piping-hot cherry pie. The hot \\nfood felt good after hours of standing in the snow. He licked the sticky syrup \\nfrom his fingers regretfully, wishing for more, then sat on the edge of a porch \\nand nibbled a piece of candy. Two boys from Carvahall wrestled nearby, but he \\nfelt no inclination to join them.\\nAs the day \\ndescended into late afternoon, the traders took their business into people’s \\nhomes. Eragon was impatient for evening, when the troubadours would come out to \\ntell stories and perform tricks. He loved hearing about magic, gods, and, if \\nthey were especially lucky, the Dragon Riders. Carvahall had its own \\nstoryteller, Brom—a friend of Eragon’s—but his tales grew old over the years, \\nwhereas the troubadours always had new ones that he listened to eagerly.\\nEragon had just \\nbroken off an icicle from the underside of the porch when he spotted Sloan \\nnearby. The butcher had not seen him, so Eragon ducked his head and bolted \\naround a corner toward Morn’s tavern.\\nThe inside was \\nhot and filled with greasy smoke from sputtering tallow candles. The \\nshiny-black Urgal horns, their twisted span as great as his outstretched arms, \\nwere mounted over the door. The bar was long and low, with a stack of staves on \\none end for customers to carve. Morn tended the bar, his sleeves rolled up to \\nhis elbows. The bottom half of his face was short and mashed, as if he had \\nrested his chin on a grinding wheel. People crowded solid oak tables and \\nlistened to two traders who had finished their business early and had come in \\nfor beer.\\nMorn looked up \\nfrom a mug he was cleaning. “Eragon! Good to see you. Where’s your uncle?”\\n“Buying,” said \\nEragon with a shrug. “He’s going to be a while.”\\n“And Roran, is \\nhe here?” asked Morn as he swiped the cloth through another mug.\\n“Yes, no sick \\nanimals to keep him back this year.”\\n“Good, good.”\\nEragon gestured \\nat the two traders. “Who are they?”\\n“Grain buyers. \\nThey bought everyone’s seed at ridiculously low prices, and now they’re telling \\nwild stories, expecting us to believe them.”\\nEragon \\nunderstood why Morn was so upset.People need that money. We can’t get by \\nwithout it. “What kind of stories?”\\nMorn snorted. \\n“They say the Varden have formed a pact with the Urgals and are massing an army \\nto attack us.Supposedly , it’s only through the grace of our king that \\nwe’ve been protected for so long—as if Galbatorix would care if we burned to \\nthe ground. . . . Go listen to them. I have enough on my hands without \\nexplaining their lies.”\\nThe first trader \\nfilled a chair with his enormous girth; his every movement caused it to protest \\nloudly. There was no hint of hair on his face, his pudgy hands were baby \\nsmooth, and he had pouting lips that curled petulantly as he sipped from a flagon. \\nThe second man had a florid face. The skin around his jaw was dry and \\ncorpulent, filled with lumps of hard fat, like cold butter gone rancid. \\nContrasted with his neck and jowls, the rest of his body was unnaturally thin.\\nThe first trader \\nvainly tried to pull back his expanding borders to fit within the chair. He \\nsaid, “No, no, you don’t understand. It is only through the king’s unceasing \\nefforts on your behalf that you are able to argue with us in safety. If he, in \\nall his wisdom, were to withdraw that support, woe unto you!”\\nSomeone \\nhollered, “Right, why don’t you also tell us the Riders have returned and \\nyou’ve each killed a hundred elves. Do you think we’re children to believe in \\nyour tales? We can take care of ourselves.” The group chuckled.\\nThe trader \\nstarted to reply when his thin companion intervened with a wave of his hand. \\nGaudy jewels flashed on his fingers. “You misunderstand. We know the Empire \\ncannot care for each of us personally, as you may want, but it can keep Urgals \\nand other abominations from overrunning this,” he searched vaguely for the \\nright term, “place.”\\nThe trader \\ncontinued, “You’re angry with the Empire for treating people unfairly, a \\nlegitimate concern, but a government cannot please everyone. There will \\ninevitably be arguments and conflicts. However, the majority of us have nothing \\nto complain about. Every country has some small group of malcontents who aren’t \\nsatisfied with the balance of power.”\\n“Yeah,” called a \\nwoman, “if you’re willing to call the Varden small!”\\nThe fat man \\nsighed. “We already explained that the Varden have no interest in helping you. \\nThat’s only a falsehood perpetuated by the traitors in an attempt to disrupt \\nthe Empire and convince us that the real threat is inside—not outside—our \\nborders. All they want to do is overthrow the king and take possession of our \\nland. They have spies everywhere as they prepare to invade. You never know who \\nmight be working for them.”\\nEragon did not \\nagree, but the traders’ words were smooth, and people were nodding. He stepped \\nforward and said, “How do you know this? I can say that clouds are green, but \\nthat doesn’t mean it’s true. Prove you aren’t lying.” The two men glared at him \\nwhile the villagers waited silently for the answer.\\nThe thin trader \\nspoke first. He avoided Eragon’s eyes. “Aren’t your children taught respect? Or \\ndo you let boys challenge men whenever they want to?”\\nThe listeners \\nfidgeted and stared at Eragon. Then a man said, “Answer the question.”\\n“It’s only \\ncommon sense,” said the fat one, sweat beading on his upper lip. His reply \\nriled the villagers, and the dispute resumed.\\nEragon returned \\nto the bar with a sour taste in his mouth. He had never before met anyone who \\nfavored the Empire and tore down its enemies. There was a deep-seated hatred of \\nthe Empire in Carvahall, almost hereditary in nature. The Empire never helped \\nthem during harsh years when they nearly starved, and its tax collectors were \\nheartless. He felt justified in disagreeing with the traders regarding the \\nking’s mercy, but he did speculate about the Varden.\\nThe Varden were \\na rebel group that constantly raided and attacked the Empire. It was a mystery \\nwho their leader was or who had formed them in the years following Galbatorix’s \\nrise to power over a century ago. The group had garnered much sympathy as they \\neluded Galbatorix’s efforts to destroy them. Little was known about the Varden \\nexcept that if you were a fugitive and had to hide, or if you hated the Empire, \\nthey would accept you. The only problem was finding them.\\nMorn leaned over \\nthe bar and said, “Incredible, isn’t it? They’re worse than vultures circling a \\ndying animal. There’s going to be trouble if they stay much longer.”\\n“For us or for \\nthem?”\\n“Them,” said \\nMorn as angry voices filled the tavern. Eragon left when the argument \\nthreatened to become violent. The door thudded shut behind him, cutting off the \\nvoices. It was early evening, and the sun was sinking rapidly; the houses cast \\nlong shadows on the ground. As Eragon headed down the street, he noticed Roran \\nand Katrina standing in an alley.\\nRoran said \\nsomething Eragon could not hear. Katrina looked down at her hands and answered \\nin an undertone, then leaned up on her tiptoes and kissed him before darting \\naway. Eragon trotted to Roran and teased, “Having a good time?” Roran grunted \\nnoncommittally as he paced away.\\n“Have you heard \\nthe traders’ news?” asked Eragon, following. Most of the villagers were \\nindoors, talking to traders or waiting until it was dark enough for the \\ntroubadours to perform.\\n“Yes.” Roran \\nseemed distracted. “What do you think of Sloan?”\\n“I thought it \\nwas obvious.”\\n“There’ll be \\nblood between us when he finds out about Katrina and me,” stated Roran. A \\nsnowflake landed on Eragon’s nose, and he looked up. The sky had turned gray. \\nHe could think of nothing appropriate to say; Roran was right. He clasped his \\ncousin on the shoulder as they continued down the byway.\\nDinner at \\nHorst’s was hearty. The room was full of conversation and laughter. Sweet \\ncordials and heavy ales were consumed in copious amounts, adding to the \\nboisterous atmosphere. When the plates were empty, Horst’s guests left the \\nhouse and strolled to the field where the traders were camped. A ring of poles \\ntopped with candles had been stuck into the ground around a large clearing. \\nBonfires blazed in the background, painting the ground with dancing shadows. \\nThe villagers slowly gathered around the circle and waited expectantly in the \\ncold.\\nThe troubadours \\ncame tumbling out of their tents, dressed in tasseled clothing, followed by \\nolder and more stately minstrels. The minstrels provided music and narration as \\ntheir younger counterparts acted out the stories. The first plays were pure \\nentertainment: bawdy and full of jokes, pratfalls, and ridiculous characters. \\nLater, however, when the candles sputtered in their sockets and everyone was \\ndrawn together into a tight circle, the old storyteller Brom stepped forward. A \\nknotted white beard rippled over his chest, and a long black cape was wrapped \\naround his bent shoulders, obscuring his body. He spread his arms with hands \\nthat reached out like talons and recited thus:\\n\\xa0\\n“The sands of \\ntime cannot be stopped. Years pass whether we will them or not . . . but we can \\nremember. What has been lost may yet live on in memories. That which you will \\nhear is imperfect and fragmented, yet treasure it, for without you it does not \\nexist. I give you now a memory that has been forgotten, hidden in the dreamy \\nhaze that lies behind us.”\\nHis keen eyes \\ninspected their interested faces. His gaze lingered on Eragon last of all.\\n“Before your \\ngrandfathers’ fathers were born, and yea, even before their fathers, the Dragon \\nRiders were formed. To protect and guard was their mission, and for thousands \\nof years they succeeded. Their prowess in battle was unmatched, for each had \\nthe strength of ten men. They were immortal unless blade or poison took them. \\nFor good only were their powers used, and under their tutelage tall cities and \\ntowers were built out of the living stone. While they kept peace, the land \\nflourished. It was a golden time. The elves were our allies, the dwarves our \\nfriends. Wealth flowed into our cities, and men prospered. But weep . . . for \\nit could not last.”\\nBrom looked down \\nsilently. Infinite sadness resonated in his voice.\\n“Though no enemy \\ncould destroy them, they could not guard against themselves. And it came to \\npass at the height of their power that a boy, Galbatorix by name, was born in \\nthe province of Inzilbêth, which is no more. At ten he was tested, as was the \\ncustom, and it was found that great power resided in him. The Riders accepted \\nhim as their own.\\n“Through their \\ntraining he passed, exceeding all others in skill. Gifted with a sharp mind and \\nstrong body, he quickly took his place among the Riders’ ranks. Some saw his \\nabrupt rise as dangerous and warned the others, but the Riders had grown \\narrogant in their power and ignored caution. Alas, sorrow was conceived that \\nday.\\n“So it was that \\nsoon after his training was finished, Galbatorix took a reckless trip with two \\nfriends. Far north they flew, night and day, and passed into the Urgals’ \\nremaining territory, foolishly thinking their new powers would protect them. \\nThere on a thick sheet of ice, unmelted even in summer, they were ambushed in \\ntheir sleep. Though his friends and their dragons were butchered and he suffered \\ngreat wounds, Galbatorix slew his attackers. Tragically, during the fight a \\nstray arrow pierced his dragon’s heart. Without the arts to save her, she died \\nin his arms. Then were the seeds of madness planted.”\\nThe storyteller \\nclasped his hands and looked around slowly, shadows flickering across his worn \\nface. The next words came like the mournful toll of a requiem.\\n“Alone, bereft \\nof much of his strength and half mad with loss, Galbatorix wandered without \\nhope in that desolate land, seeking death. It did not come to him, though he \\nthrew himself without fear against any living thing. Urgals and other monsters \\nsoon fled from his haunted form. During this time he came to realize that the \\nRiders might grant him another dragon. Driven by this thought, he began the \\narduous journey, on foot, back through the Spine. Territory he had soared over \\neffortlessly on a dragon’s back now took him months to traverse. He could hunt \\nwith magic, but oftentimes he walked in places where animals did not travel. \\nThus when his feet finally left the mountains, he was close to death. A farmer \\nfound him collapsed in the mud and summoned the Riders.\\n“Unconscious, he \\nwas taken to their holdings, and his body healed. He slept for four days. Upon \\nawakening he gave no sign of his fevered mind. When he was brought before a \\ncouncil convened to judge him, Galbatorix demanded another dragon. The \\ndesperation of the request revealed his dementia, and the council saw him for \\nwhat he truly was. Denied his hope, Galbatorix, through the twisted mirror of \\nhis madness, came to believe it was the Riders’ fault his dragon had died. \\nNight after night he brooded on that and formulated a plan to exact revenge.”\\nBrom’s words \\ndropped to a mesmerizing whisper.\\n“He found a \\nsympathetic Rider, and there his insidious words took root. By persistent \\nreasoning and the use of dark secrets learned from a Shade, he inflamed the \\nRider against their elders. Together they treacherously lured and killed an \\nelder. When the foul deed was done, Galbatorix turned on his ally and slaughtered \\nhim without warning. The Riders found him, then, with blood dripping from his \\nhands. A scream tore from his lips, and he fled into the night. As he was \\ncunning in his madness, they could not find him.\\n“For years he \\nhid in wastelands like a hunted animal, always watching for pursuers. His \\natrocity was not forgotten, but over time searches ceased. Then through some \\nill fortune he met a young Rider, Morzan—strong of body, but weak of mind. \\nGalbatorix convinced Morzan to leave a gate unbolted in the citadel Ilirea, \\nwhich is now called Urû’baen. Through this gate Galbatorix entered and stole a \\ndragon hatchling.\\n“He and his new \\ndisciple hid themselves in an evil place where the Riders dared not venture. \\nThere Morzan entered into a dark apprenticeship, learning secrets and forbidden \\nmagic that should never have been revealed. When his instruction was finished \\nand Galbatorix’s black dragon, Shruikan, was fully grown, Galbatorix revealed \\nhimself to the world, with Morzan at his side. Together they fought any Rider \\nthey met. With each kill their strength grew. Twelve of the Riders joined \\nGalbatorix out of desire for power and revenge against perceived wrongs. Those \\ntwelve, with Morzan, became the Thirteen Forsworn. The Riders were unprepared \\nand fell beneath the onslaught. The elves, too, fought bitterly against \\nGalbatorix, but they were overthrown and forced to flee to their secret places, \\nfrom whence they come no more.\\n“Only Vrael, \\nleader of the Riders, could resist Galbatorix and the Forsworn. Ancient and wise, \\nhe struggled to save what he could and keep the remaining dragons from falling \\nto his enemies. In the last battle, before the gates of Dorú Areaba, Vrael \\ndefeated Galbatorix, but hesitated with the final blow. Galbatorix seized the \\nmoment and smote him in the side. Grievously wounded, Vrael fled to Utgard \\nMountain, where he hoped to gather strength. But it was not to be, for \\nGalbatorix found him. As they fought, Galbatorix kicked Vrael in the fork of \\nhis legs. With that underhanded blow, he gained dominance over Vrael and \\nremoved his head with a blazing sword.\\n“Then as power \\nrushed through his veins, Galbatorix anointed himself king over all Alagaësia.\\n“And from that \\nday, he has ruled us.”\\n\\xa0\\nWith the \\ncompletion of the story, Brom shuffled away with the troubadours. Eragon \\nthought he saw a tear shining on his cheek. People murmured quietly to each \\nother as they departed. Garrow said to Eragon and Roran, “Consider yourselves \\nfortunate. I have heard this tale only twice in my life. If the Empire knew that \\nBrom had recited it, he would not live to see a new month.”\\nF ATE’SGIFT\\nThe evening after \\ntheir return from Carvahall, Eragon decided to test the stone as Merlock had. \\nAlone in his room, he set it on his bed and laid three tools next to it. He \\nstarted with a wooden mallet and lightly tapped the stone. It produced a subtle \\nringing. Satisfied, he picked up the next tool, a heavy leather hammer. A \\nmournful peal reverberated when it struck. Lastly, he pounded a small chisel \\nagainst it. The metal did not chip or scratch the stone, but it produced the \\nclearest sound yet. As the final note died away, he thought he heard a faint \\nsqueak.\\nMerlock said the \\nstone was hollow; there could be something of value inside. I don’t know how to \\nopen it, though. There must have been a good reason for someone to shape it, \\nbut whoever sent the stone into the Spine hasn’t taken the trouble to retrieve \\nit or doesn’t know where it is. But I don’t believe that a magician with enough \\npower to transport the stone wouldn’t be able to find it again. So was I meant \\nto have it?He \\ncould not answer the question. Resigned to an unsolvable mystery, he picked up \\nthe tools and returned the stone to its shelf.\\n\\xa0\\nThat night he \\nwas abruptly roused from sleep. He listened carefully. All was quiet. Uneasy, \\nhe slid his hand under the mattress and grasped his knife. He waited a few \\nminutes, then slowly sank back to sleep.\\nA squeak pierced \\nthe silence, tearing him back to wakefulness. He rolled out of bed and yanked \\nthe knife from its sheath. Fumbling with a tinderbox, he lit a candle. The door \\nto his room was closed. Though the squeak was too loud for a mouse or rat, he \\nstill checked under the bed. Nothing. He sat on the edge of the mattress and \\nrubbed the sleep from his eyes. Another squeak filled the air, and he started \\nviolently.\\nWhere was the \\nnoise was coming from? Nothing could be in the floor or walls; they were solid \\nwood. The same went for his bed, and he would have noticed if anything had \\ncrawled into his straw mattress during the night. His eyes settled on the \\nstone. He took it off the shelf and absently cradled it as he studied the room. \\nA squeak rang in his ears and reverberated through his fingers; it came from \\nthe stone.\\nThe stone had \\ngiven him nothing but frustration and anger, and now it would not even let him \\nsleep! It ignored his furious glare and sat solidly, occasionally peeping. Then \\nit gave one very loud squeak and fell silent. Eragon warily put it away and got \\nback under the sheets. Whatever secret the stone held, it would have to wait until \\nmorning.\\nThe moon was \\nshining through his window when he woke again. The stone was rocking rapidly on \\nthe shelf, knocking against the wall. It was bathed in cool moonlight that \\nbleached its surface. Eragon jumped out of bed, knife in hand. The motion stopped, \\nbut he remained tense. Then the stone started squeaking and rocking faster than \\never.\\nWith an oath, he \\nbegan dressing. He did not care how valuable the stone might be; he was going \\nto take it far away and bury it. The rocking stopped; the stone became quiet. \\nIt quivered, then rolled forward and dropped onto the floor with a loud thump. \\nHe inched toward the door in alarm as the stone wobbled toward him.\\nSuddenly a crack \\nappeared on the stone. Then another and another. Transfixed, Eragon leaned \\nforward, still holding the knife. At the top of the stone, where all the cracks \\nmet, a small piece wobbled, as if it were balanced on something, then rose and \\ntoppled to the floor. After another series of squeaks, a small dark head poked \\nout of the hole, followed by a weirdly angled body. Eragon gripped the knife \\ntighter and held very still. Soon the creature was all the way out of the \\nstone. It stayed in place for a moment, then skittered into the moonlight.\\nEragon recoiled \\nin shock. Standing in front of him, licking off the membrane that encased it, \\nwas a dragon.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 10': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA WAKENING \\nThe dragon was no \\nlonger than his forearm, yet it was dignified and noble. Its scales were deep \\nsapphire blue, the same color as the stone. But not a stone, he realized, an \\negg. The dragon fanned its wings; they were what had made it appear so \\ncontorted. The wings were several times longer than its body and ribbed with \\nthin fingers of bone that extended from the wing’s front edge, forming a line \\nof widely spaced talons. The dragon’s head was roughly triangular. Two \\ndiminutive white fangs curved down out of its upper jaw. They looked very \\nsharp. Its claws were also white, like polished ivory, and slightly serrated on \\nthe inside curve. A line of small spikes ran down the creature’s spine from the \\nbase of its head to the tip of its tail. A hollow where its neck and shoulders \\njoined created a larger-than-normal gap between the spikes.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly, and the dragon’s head snapped around. Hard, ice-blue eyes fixed on \\nhim. He kept very still. It might be a formidable enemy if it decided to \\nattack.\\nThe dragon lost \\ninterest in Eragon and awkwardly explored the room, squealing as it bumped into \\na wall or furniture. With a flutter of wings, it leapt onto the bed and crawled \\nto his pillow, squeaking. Its mouth was open pitifully, like a young bird’s, \\ndisplaying rows of pointed teeth. Eragon sat cautiously on the end of the bed. \\nThe dragon smelled his hand, nibbled his sleeve. He pulled his arm back.\\nA smile tugged \\nat Eragon’s lips as he looked at the small creature. Tentatively, he reached \\nout with his right hand and touched its flank. A blast of icy energy surged \\ninto his hand and raced up his arm, burning in his veins like liquid fire. He \\nfell back with a wild cry. An iron clang filled his ears, and he heard a \\nsoundless scream of rage. Every part of his body seared with pain. He struggled \\nto move, but was unable to. After what seemed like hours, warmth seeped back \\ninto his limbs, leaving them tingling. Shivering uncontrollably, he pushed \\nhimself upright. His hand was numb, his fingers paralyzed. Alarmed, he watched \\nas the middle of his palm shimmered and formed a diffused white oval. The skin \\nitched and burned like a spider bite. His heart pounded frantically.\\nEragon blinked, \\ntrying to understand what had occurred. Something brushed against his \\nconsciousness, like a finger trailing over his skin. He felt it again, but this \\ntime it solidified into a tendril of thought through which he could feel a \\ngrowing curiosity. It was as if an invisible wall surrounding his thoughts had \\nfallen away, and he was now free to reach out with his mind. He was afraid that \\nwithout anything to hold him back, he would float out of his body and be unable \\nto return, becoming a spirit of the ether. Scared, he pulled away from the \\ncontact. The new sense vanished as if he had closed his eyes. He glared \\nsuspiciously at the motionless dragon.\\nA scaly leg \\nscraped against his side, and he jerked back. But the energy did not shock him \\nagain. Puzzled, he rubbed the dragon’s head with his right hand. A light \\ntingling ran up his arm. The dragon nuzzled him, arching its back like a cat. \\nHe slid a finger over its thin wing membranes. They felt like old parchment, \\nvelvety and warm, but still slightly damp. Hundreds of slender veins pulsed through \\nthem.\\nAgain the \\ntendril touched his mind, but this time, instead of curiosity, he sensed an \\noverpowering, ravenous hunger. He got up with a sigh. This was a dangerous \\nanimal, of that he was sure. Yet it seemed so helpless crawling on his bed, he \\ncould only wonder if there was any harm in keeping it. The dragon wailed in a \\nreedy tone as it looked for food. Eragon quickly scratched its head to keep it \\nquiet.I’ll think about this later, he decided, and left the room, \\ncarefully closing the door.\\nReturning with \\ntwo strips of dried meat, he found the dragon sitting on the windowsill, \\nwatching the moon. He cut the meat into small squares and offered one to the \\ndragon. It smelled the square cautiously, then jabbed its head forward like a \\nsnake and snatched the meat from his fingers, swallowing it whole with a \\npeculiar jerk. The dragon prodded Eragon’s hand for more food.\\nHe fed it, \\ncareful to keep his fingers out of the way. By the time there was only one \\nsquare left, the dragon’s belly was bulging. He proffered the last piece; the \\ndragon considered it for a moment, then lazily snapped it up. Done eating, it \\ncrawled onto his arm and curled against his chest. Then it snorted, a puff of \\ndark smoke rising from its nostrils. Eragon looked at it with wonder.\\nJust when he \\nthought the dragon was asleep, a low humming came from its vibrating throat. \\nGently, he carried it to the bed and set it by his pillow. The dragon, eyes \\nclosed, wrapped its tail around the bedpost contentedly. Eragon lay next to it, \\nflexing his hand in the near darkness.\\nHe faced a \\npainful dilemma: By raising a dragon, he could become a Rider. Myths and \\nstories about Riders were treasured, and being one would automatically place \\nhim among those legends. However, if the Empire discovered the dragon, he and \\nhis family would be put to death unless he joined the king. No one could—or \\nwould—help them. The simplest solution was just to kill the dragon, but the \\nidea was repugnant, and he rejected it. Dragons were too revered for him to \\neven consider that.Besides, what could betray us? he thought.We live \\nin a remote area and have done nothing to draw attention.\\nThe problem was \\nconvincing Garrow and Roran to let him keep the dragon. Neither of them would \\ncare to have a dragon around.I could raise it in secret. In a month or two \\nit will be too large for Garrow to get rid of, but will he accept it? Even if \\nhe does, can I get enough food for the dragon while it’s hiding? It’s no larger \\nthan a small cat, but it ate an entire handful of meat! I suppose it’ll be able \\nto hunt for itself eventually, but how long until then? Will it be able to \\nsurvive the cold outside? All the same, he wanted the dragon. The more he \\nthought about it, the surer he was. However things might work out with Garrow, \\nEragon would do everything he could to protect it. Determined, he fell asleep \\nwith the dragon cradled against him.\\nWhen dawn came, \\nthe dragon was sitting atop his bedpost, like an ancient sentinel welcoming the \\nnew day. Eragon marveled at its color. He had never seen such a clear, hard \\nblue. Its scales were like hundreds of small gemstones. He noticed that the \\nwhite oval on his palm, where he had touched the dragon, had a silvery sheen. \\nHe hoped he could hide it by keeping his hands dirty.\\nThe dragon \\nlaunched off the post and glided to the floor. Eragon gingerly picked it up and \\nleft the quiet house, pausing to grab meat, several leather strips, and as many \\nrags as he could carry. The crisp morning was beautiful; a fresh layer of snow \\ncovered the farm. He smiled as the small creature looked around with interest \\nfrom the safety of his arms.\\nHurrying across \\nthe fields, he walked silently into the dark forest, searching for a safe place \\nfor the dragon to stay. Eventually he found a rowan tree standing alone on a \\nbarren knoll, its branches snow-tipped gray fingers that reached toward the \\nsky. He set the dragon down by the base of the trunk and shook the leather onto \\nthe ground.\\nWith a few deft \\nmovements, he made a noose and slipped it over the dragon’s head as it explored \\nthe snowy clumps surrounding the tree. The leather was worn, but it would hold. \\nHe watched the dragon crawl around, then untied the noose from its neck and \\nfashioned a makeshift harness for its legs so the dragon would not strangle \\nitself. Next he gathered an armful of sticks and built a crude hut high in the \\nbranches, layering the inside with rags and stashing the meat. Snow fell on his \\nface as the tree swayed. He hung more rags over the front of the shelter to \\nkeep heat inside. Pleased, he surveyed his work.\\n“Time to show \\nyou your new home,” he said, and lifted the dragon up into the branches. It \\nwriggled, trying to get free, then clambered into the hut, where it ate a piece \\nof meat, curled up, and blinked coyly at him. “You’ll be fine as long as you \\nstay in here,” he instructed. The dragon blinked again.\\nSure that it had \\nnot understood him, Eragon groped with his mind until he felt the dragon’s \\nconsciousness. Again he had the terrible feeling ofopenness —of a space \\nso large it pressed down on him like a heavy blanket. Summoning his strength, \\nhe focused on the dragon and tried to impress on it one idea:Stay here. \\nThe dragon stopped moving and cocked its head at him. He pushed harder:Stay \\nhere. A dim acknowledgment came tentatively through the link, but Eragon \\nwondered if it really understood.After all, it’s only an animal. He \\nretreated from the contact with relief and felt the safety of his own mind \\nenvelop him.\\nEragon left the \\ntree, casting glances backward. The dragon stuck its head out of the shelter \\nand watched with large eyes as he left.\\nAfter a hurried \\nwalk home, he sneaked back into his room to dispose of the egg fragments. He \\nwas sure Garrow and Roran would not notice the egg’s absence—it had faded from \\ntheir thoughts after they learned it could not be sold. When his family got up, \\nRoran mentioned that he had heard some noises during the night but, to Eragon’s \\nrelief, did not pursue the issue.\\nEragon’s \\nenthusiasm made the day go by quickly. The mark on his hand proved easy to \\nhide, so he soon stopped worrying about it. Before long he headed back to the \\nrowan, carrying sausages he had pilfered from the cellar. With apprehension, he \\napproached the tree.Is the dragon able to survive outside in winter?\\nHis fears were \\ngroundless. The dragon was perched on a branch, gnawing on something between \\nits front legs. It started squeaking excitedly when it saw him. He was pleased \\nto see that it had remained in the tree, above the reach of large predators. As \\nsoon as he dropped the sausages at the base of the trunk, the dragon glided \\ndown. While it voraciously tore apart the food, Eragon examined the shelter. \\nAll the meat he had left was gone, but the hut was intact, and tufts of \\nfeathers littered the floor.Good. It can get its own food.\\nIt struck him \\nthat he did not know if the dragon was a he or a she. He lifted and turned it \\nover, ignoring its squeals of displeasure, but was unable to find any \\ndistinguishing marks.It seems like it won’t give up any secrets without a struggle.\\nHe spent a long \\ntime with the dragon. He untied it, set it on his shoulder, and went to explore \\nthe woods. The snow-laden trees watched over them like solemn pillars of a \\ngreat cathedral. In that isolation, Eragon showed the dragon what he knew about \\nthe forest, not caring if it understood his meaning. It was the simple act of \\nsharing that mattered. He talked to it continuously. The dragon gazed back at \\nhim with bright eyes, drinking in his words. For a while he just sat with it \\nresting in his arms and watched it with wonder, still stunned by recent events. \\nEragon started for home at sunset, conscious of two hard blue eyes drilling \\ninto his back, indignant at being left behind.\\nThat night he \\nbrooded about all the things that could happen to a small and unprotected \\nanimal. Thoughts of ice storms and vicious animals tormented him. It took hours \\nfor him to find sleep. His dreams were of foxes and black wolves tearing at the \\ndragon with bloody teeth.\\nIn the sunrise \\nglow, Eragon ran from the house with food and scraps of cloth—extra insulation \\nfor the shelter. He found the dragon awake and safe, watching the sunrise from \\nhigh in the tree. He fervently thanked all the gods, known and unknown. The \\ndragon came down to the ground as he approached and leapt into his arms, \\nhuddling close to his chest. The cold had not harmed it, but it seemed \\nfrightened. A puff of dark smoke blew out of its nostrils. He stroked it \\ncomfortingly and sat with his back to the rowan, murmuring softly. He kept \\nstill as the dragon buried its head in his coat. After a while it crawled out \\nof his embrace and onto his shoulder. He fed it, then wrapped the new rags \\naround the hut. They played together for a time, but Eragon had to return to \\nthe house before long.\\n\\xa0\\nA smooth routine \\nwas quickly established. Every morning Eragon ran out to the tree and gave the \\ndragon breakfast before hurrying back. During the day he attacked his chores \\nuntil they were finished and he could visit the dragon again. Both Garrow and \\nRoran noted his behavior and asked why he spent so much time outside. Eragon \\njust shrugged and started checking to make sure he was not followed to the \\ntree.\\nAfter the first \\nfew days he stopped worrying that a mishap would befall the dragon. Its growth \\nwas explosive; it would soon be safe from most dangers. The dragon doubled in \\nsize in the first week. Four days later it was as high as his knee. It no \\nlonger fit inside the hut in the rowan, so Eragon was forced to build a hidden \\nshelter on the ground. The task took him three days.\\nWhen the dragon \\nwas a fortnight old, Eragon was compelled to let it roam free because it needed \\nso much food. The first time he untied it, only the force of his will kept it \\nfrom following him back to the farm. Every time it tried, he pushed it away \\nwith his mind until it learned to avoid the house and its other inhabitants.\\nAnd he impressed \\non the dragon the importance of hunting only in the Spine, where there was less \\nchance of being seen. Farmers would notice if game started disappearing from \\nPalancar Valley. It made him feel both safer and uneasy when the dragon was so \\nfar away.\\nThe mental \\ncontact he shared with the dragon waxed stronger each day. He found that \\nalthough it did not comprehend words, he could communicate with it through \\nimages or emotions. It was an imprecise method, however, and he was often \\nmisunderstood. The range at which they could touch each other’s thoughts \\nexpanded rapidly. Soon Eragon could contact the dragon anywhere within three \\nleagues. He often did so, and the dragon, in turn, would lightly brush against \\nhis mind. These mute conversations filled his working hours. There was always a \\nsmall part of him connected to the dragon, ignored at times, but never \\nforgotten. When he talked with people, the contact was distracting, like a fly \\nbuzzing in his ear.\\nAs the dragon \\nmatured, its squeaks deepened to a roar and the humming became a low rumble, \\nyet the dragon did not breathe fire, which concerned him. He had seen it blow \\nsmoke when it was upset, but there was never a hint of flame.\\nWhen the month \\nended, Eragon’s elbow was level with the dragon’s shoulder. In that brief span, \\nit had transformed from a small, weak animal into a powerful beast. Its hard \\nscales were as tough as chain-mail armor, its teeth like daggers.\\nEragon took long \\nwalks in the evening with the dragon padding beside him. When they found a \\nclearing, he would settle against a tree and watch the dragon soar through the \\nair. He loved to see it fly and regretted that it was not yet big enough to \\nride. He often sat beside the dragon and rubbed its neck, feeling sinews and \\ncorded muscles flex under his hands.\\nDespite Eragon’s \\nefforts, the forest around the farm filled with signs of the dragon’s \\nexistence. It was impossible to erase all the huge four-clawed footprints sunk \\ndeep in the snow, and he refused even to try to hide the giant dung heaps that \\nwere becoming far too common. The dragon had rubbed against trees, stripping \\noff the bark, and had sharpened its claws on dead logs, leaving gashes inches \\ndeep. If Garrow or Roran went too far beyond the farm’s boundaries, they would \\ndiscover the dragon. Eragon could imagine no worse way for the truth to come \\nout, so he decided to preempt it by explaining everything to them.\\nHe wanted to do \\ntwo things first, though: give the dragon a suitable name and learn more about \\ndragons in general. To that end he needed to talk with Brom, master of epics \\nand legends—the only places where dragonlore survived.\\nSo when Roran \\nwent to get a chisel repaired in Carvahall, Eragon volunteered to go with him.\\n\\xa0\\nThe evening \\nbefore they left, Eragon went to a small clearing in the forest and called the \\ndragon with his mind. After a moment he saw a fast-moving speck in the dusky \\nsky. The dragon dived toward him, pulled up sharply, then leveled off above the \\ntrees. He heard a low-pitched whistle as air rushed over its wings. It banked \\nslowly to his left and spiraled gently down to the ground. The dragon \\nback-flapped for balance with a deep, muffledthwump as it landed.\\nEragon opened \\nhis mind, still uncomfortable with the strange sensation, and told the dragon \\nthat he was leaving. It snorted with unease. He attempted to soothe it with a \\ncalming mental picture, but the dragon whipped its tail, unsatisfied. He rested \\nhis hand on its shoulder and tried to radiate peace and serenity. Scales bumped \\nunder his fingers as he patted it gently.\\nA single word \\nrang in his head, deep and clear.\\nEragon. \\nIt was solemn \\nand sad, as if an unbreakable pact were being sealed. He stared at the dragon \\nand a cold tingle ran down his arm.\\nEragon. \\nA hard knot \\nformed in his stomach as unfathomable sapphire eyes gazed back at him. For the \\nfirst time he did not think of the dragon as an animal. It was something else, \\nsomething . . . different. He raced home, trying to escape the dragon.My \\ndragon.\\nEragon. \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 11': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT EA FORTWO\\nRoran and Eragon \\nparted at the outskirts of Carvahall. Eragon walked slowly to Brom’s house, \\nengrossed in his thoughts. He stopped at the doorstep and raised his hand to \\nknock.\\nA voice rasped, \\n“What do you want, boy?”\\nHe whirled \\naround. Behind him Brom leaned on a twisted staff embellished with strange \\ncarvings. He wore a brown hooded robe like a friar. A pouch hung from the \\nscuffed leather belt clasped around his waist. Above his white beard, a proud \\neagle nose hooked over his mouth and dominated his face. He peered at Eragon \\nwith deep-set eyes shadowed by a gnarled brow and waited for his reply.\\n“To get \\ninformation,” Eragon said. “Roran is getting a chisel fixed and I had free \\ntime, so I came to see if you could answer a few questions.”\\nThe old man \\ngrunted and reached for the door. Eragon noticed a gold ring on his right hand. \\nLight glinted off a sapphire, highlighting a strange symbol carved on its face. \\n“You might as well come in; we’ll be talking awhile. Your questions never seem \\nto end.” Inside, the house was darker than charcoal, an acrid smell heavy in \\nthe air. “Now, for a light.” Eragon heard the old man move around, then a low \\ncurse as something crashed to the floor. “Ah, here we go.” A white spark \\nflashed; a flame wavered into existence.\\nBrom stood with \\na candle before a stone fireplace. Stacks of books surrounded a high-backed, \\ndeeply carved wooden chair that faced the mantel; the four legs were shaped \\nlike eagle claws, and the seat and back were padded with leather embossed with \\na swirling rose pattern. A cluster of lesser chairs held piles of scrolls. Ink \\npots and pens were scattered across a writing desk. “Make room for yourself, \\nbut by the lost kings, becareful . This stuff is valuable.”\\nEragon stepped \\nover pages of parchment covered with angular runes. He gently lifted cracking \\nscrolls off a chair and placed them on the floor. A cloud of dust flew into the \\nair as he sat. He stifled a sneeze.\\nBrom bent down \\nand lit the fire with his candle. “Good! Nothing like sitting by a fire for \\nconversation.” He threw back his hood to reveal hair that was not white, but \\nsilver, then hung a kettle over the flames and settled into the high-backed \\nchair.\\n“Now, what do \\nyou want?” He addressed Eragon roughly, but not unkindly.\\n“Well,” said \\nEragon, wondering how best to approach the subject, “I keep hearing about the \\nDragon Riders and their supposed accomplishments. Most everyone seems to want \\nthem to return, but I’ve never heard tell of how they were started, where the \\ndragons came from, or what made the Riders special—aside from the dragons.”\\n“A vast subject \\nto tell about,” grumbled Brom. He peered at Eragon alertly. “If I told you \\ntheir whole story, we would still be sitting here when winter comes again. It \\nwill have to be reduced to a manageable length. But before we start properly, I \\nneed my pipe.”\\nEragon waited \\npatiently as Brom tamped down the tobacco. He liked Brom. The old man was \\nirascible at times, but he never seemed to mind taking time for Eragon. Eragon \\nhad once asked him where he came from, and Brom had laughed, saying, “A village \\nmuch like Carvahall, only not quite as interesting.” Curiosity aroused, Eragon \\nasked his uncle. But Garrow could only tell him that Brom had bought a house in \\nCarvahall nearly fifteen years ago and had lived there quietly ever since.\\nBrom used a \\ntinderbox to light the pipe. He puffed a few times, then said, “There . . . we \\nwon’t have to stop, except for the tea. Now, about the Riders, or the \\nShur’tugal, as they are called by the elves. Where to start? They spanned \\ncountless years and, at the height of their power, held sway over twice the \\nEmpire’s lands. Numerous stories have been told about them, most nonsense. If \\nyou believed everything said, you would expect them to have the powers of a \\nlesser god. Scholars have devoted entire lives to separating these fictions \\nfrom fact, but it’s doubtful any of them will succeed. However, it isn’t an \\nimpossible task if we confine ourselves to the three areas you specified: how \\nthe Riders began, why they were so highly regarded, and where dragons came \\nfrom. I shall start with the last item.” Eragon settled back and listened to \\nthe man’s mesmerizing voice.\\n“Dragons have no \\nbeginning, unless it lies with the creation of Alagaësia itself. And if they \\nhave an end, it will be when this world perishes, for they suffer as the land \\ndoes. They, the dwarves, and a few others are the true inhabitants of this \\nland. They lived here before all others, strong and proud in their elemental \\nglory. Their world was unchanging until the first elves sailed over the sea on \\ntheir silver ships.”\\n“Where did the \\nelves come from?” interrupted Eragon. “And why are they called the fair folk? \\nDo they really exist?”\\nBrom scowled. \\n“Do you want your original questions answered or not? They won’t be if you want \\nto explore every obscure piece of knowledge.”\\n“Sorry,” said \\nEragon. He dipped his head and tried to look contrite.\\n“No, you’re \\nnot,” said Brom with some amusement. He shifted his gaze to the fire and \\nwatched it lick the underside of the kettle. “If you must know, elves are not \\nlegends, and they are called the fair folk because they are more graceful than \\nany of the other races. They come from what they call Alalea, though none but \\nthey know what, or even where, it is.\\n“Now,” he glared \\nfrom under his bushy eyebrows to make sure there would be no more \\ninterruptions, “the elves were a proud race then, and strong in magic. At first \\nthey regarded dragons as mere animals. From that belief rose a deadly mistake. \\nA brash elven youth hunted down a dragon, as he would a stag, and killed it. \\nOutraged, the dragons ambushed and slaughtered the elf. Unfortunately, the \\nbloodletting did not stop there. The dragons massed together and attacked the \\nentire elven nation. Dismayed by the terrible misunderstanding, the elves tried \\nto end the hostilities, but couldn’t find a way to communicate with the \\ndragons.\\n“Thus, to \\ngreatly abbreviate a complicated series of occurrences, there was a very long \\nand very bloody war, which both sides later regretted. At the beginning the \\nelves fought only to defend themselves, for they were reluctant to escalate the \\nfighting, but the dragons’ ferocity eventually forced them to attack for their \\nown survival. This lasted for five years and would have continued for much longer \\nif an elf called Eragon hadn’t found a dragon egg.” Eragon blinked in surprise. \\n“Ah, I see you didn’t know of your namesake,” said Brom.\\n“No.” The \\nteakettle whistled stridently.Why was I named after an elf?\\n“Then you should \\nfind this all the more interesting,” said Brom. He hooked the kettle out of the \\nfire and poured boiling water into two cups. Handing one to Eragon, he warned, \\n“These leaves don’t need to steep long, so drink it quickly before it gets too \\nstrong.” Eragon tried a sip, but scalded his tongue. Brom set his own cup aside \\nand continued smoking the pipe.\\n“No one knows \\nwhy that egg was abandoned. Some say the parents were killed in an elven \\nattack. Others believe the dragons purposefully left it there. Either way, \\nEragon saw the value of raising a friendly dragon. He cared for it secretly \\nand, in the custom of the ancient language, named him Bid’Daum. When Bid’Daum \\nhad grown to a good size, they traveled together among the dragons and \\nconvinced them to live in peace with the elves. Treaties were formed between \\nthe two races. To ensure that war would never break out again, they decided \\nthat it was necessary to establish the Riders.\\n“At first the \\nRiders were intended merely as a means of communication between the elves and \\ndragons. However, as time passed, their worth was recognized and they were \\ngiven ever more authority. Eventually they took the island Vroengard for their \\nhome and built a city on it—Dorú Areaba. Before Galbatorix overthrew them, the \\nRiders held more power than all the kings in Alagaësia. Now I believe I have \\nanswered two of your questions.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon absently. It seemed like an incredible coincidence that he had been \\nnamed after the first Rider. For some reason his name did not feel the same \\nanymore. “What doesEragon mean?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Brom. “It’s very old. I doubt anyone remembers except the elves, and \\nfortune would have to smile greatly before you talked with one. It is a good \\nname to have, though; you should be proud of it. Not everyone has one so \\nhonorable.”\\nEragon brushed \\nthe matter from his mind and focused on what he had learned from Brom; there \\nwas something missing. “I don’t understand. Where were we when the Riders were \\ncreated?”\\n“We?” asked \\nBrom, raising an eyebrow.\\n“You know, all \\nof us.” Eragon waved his hands vaguely. “Humans in general.”\\nBrom laughed. \\n“We are no more native to this land than the elves. It took our ancestors \\nanother three centuries to arrive here and join the Riders.”\\n“That can’t be,” \\nprotested Eragon. “We’ve always lived in Palancar Valley.”\\n“That might be \\ntrue for a few generations, but beyond that, no. It isn’t even true for you, \\nEragon,” said Brom gently. “Though you consider yourself part of Garrow’s \\nfamily, and rightly so, your sire was not from here. Ask around and you’ll find \\nmany people who haven’t been here that long. This valley is old and hasn’t \\nalways belonged to us.”\\nEragon scowled \\nand gulped at the tea. It was still hot enough to burn his throat. This was his \\nhome, regardless of who his father was! “What happened to the dwarves after the \\nRiders were destroyed?”\\n“No one really \\nknows. They fought with the Riders through the first few battles, but when it \\nbecame clear Galbatorix was going to win, they sealed all the known entrances \\nto their tunnels and disappeared underground. As far as I know, not one has \\nbeen seen since.”\\n“And the \\ndragons?” he asked. “What of them? Surely they weren’t all killed.”\\nBrom answered \\nsorrowfully, “That is the greatest mystery in Alagaësia nowadays: How many \\ndragons survived Galbatorix’s murderous slaughter? He spared those who agreed \\nto serve him, but only the twisted dragons of the Forsworn would assist his \\nmadness. If any dragons aside from Shruikan are still alive, they have hidden \\nthemselves so they will never be found by the Empire.”\\nSo wheredidmy dragon \\ncome from?wondered Eragon. “Were the Urgals here when the elves came to \\nAlagaësia?” he asked.\\n“No, they \\nfollowed the elves across the sea, like ticks seeking blood. They were one of \\nthe reasons the Riders became valued for their battle prowess and ability to \\nkeep the peace. . . . Much can be learned from this history. It’s a pity the \\nking makes it a delicate subject,” reflected Brom.\\n“Yes, I heard \\nyour story the last time I was in town.”\\n“Story!” roared \\nBrom. Lightning flashed in his eyes. “If it is a story, then the rumors of my \\ndeath are true and you are speaking with a ghost! Respect the past; you never \\nknow how it may affect you.”\\nEragon waited \\nuntil Brom’s face mellowed before he dared ask, “How big were the dragons?”\\nA dark plume of \\nsmoke swirled above Brom like a miniature thunderstorm. “Larger than a house. \\nEven the small ones had wingspans over a hundred feet; they never stopped \\ngrowing. Some of the ancient ones, before the Empire killed them, could have \\npassed for large hills.”\\nDismay swept \\nthrough Eragon.How can I hide my dragon in the years to come? He raged \\nsilently, but kept his voice calm. “When did they mature?”\\n“Well,” said \\nBrom, scratching his chin, “they couldn’t breathe fire until they were around \\nfive to six months old, which was about when they could mate. The older a \\ndragon was, the longer it could breathe fire. Some of them could keep at it for \\nminutes.” Brom blew a smoke ring and watched it float up to the ceiling.\\n“I heard that \\ntheir scales shone like gems.”\\nBrom leaned forward \\nand growled, “You heard right. They came in every color and shade. It was said \\nthat a group of them looked like a living rainbow, constantly shifting and \\nshimmering. But who told you that?”\\nEragon froze for \\na second, then lied, “A trader.”\\n“What was his \\nname?” asked Brom. His tangled eyebrows met in a thick white line; the wrinkles \\ndeepened on his forehead. Unnoticed, the pipe smoldered out.\\nEragon pretended \\nto think. “I don’t know. He was talking in Morn’s, but I never found out who he \\nwas.”\\n“I wish you \\nhad,” muttered Brom.\\n“He also said a \\nRider could hear his dragon’s thoughts,” said Eragon quickly, hoping that the \\nfictitious trader would protect him from suspicion.\\nBrom’s eyes \\nnarrowed. Slowly he took out a tinderbox and struck the flint. Smoke rose, and \\nhe took a long pull from the pipe, exhaling slowly. In a flat voice he said, \\n“He was wrong. It isn’t in any of the stories, and I know them all. Did he say \\nanything else?”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“No.” Brom was too interested in the trader for him to continue the falsehood. \\nCasually he inquired, “Did dragons live very long?”\\nBrom did not \\nrespond at once. His chin sank to his chest while his fingers tapped the pipe \\nthoughtfully, light reflecting off his ring. “Sorry, my mind was elsewhere. \\nYes, a dragon will live for quite a while, forever, in fact, as long as it \\nisn’t killed and its Rider doesn’t die.”\\n“How does anyone \\nknow that?” objected Eragon. “If dragons die when their Riders do, they could \\nonly live to be sixty or seventy. You said during your . . . narration that \\nRiders lived for hundreds of years, but that’s impossible.” It troubled him to \\nthink of outliving his family and friends.\\nA quiet smile \\ncurled Brom’s lips as he said slyly, “What is possible is subjective. Some \\nwould say that you cannot travel through the Spine and live, yet you do. It’s a \\nmatter of perspective. You must be very wise to know so much at such a young \\nage.” Eragon flushed, and the old man chuckled. “Don’t be angry; you can’t be \\nexpected to know such things. You forget that the dragons were magical—they \\naffected everything around them in strange ways. The Riders were closest to \\nthem and experienced this the most. The most common side effect was an extended \\nlife. Our king has lived long enough to make that apparent, but most people \\nattribute it to his own magical abilities. There were also other, less \\nnoticeable changes. All the Riders were stronger of body, keener of mind, and \\ntruer of sight than normal men. Along with this, a human Rider would slowly \\nacquire pointed ears, though they were never as prominent as an elf’s.”\\nEragon had to \\nstop his hand from reaching up to feel the tips of his ears.How else will \\nthis dragon change my life? Not only has it gotten inside my head, but it’s \\naltering my body as well! “Were dragons very smart?”\\n“Didn’t you pay \\nattention to what I told you earlier!” demanded Brom. “How could the elves form \\nagreements and peace treaties with dumb brutes? They were as intelligent as you \\nor I.”\\n“But they were \\nanimals,” persisted Eragon.\\nBrom snorted. \\n“They were no more animals than we are. For some reason people praise \\neverything the Riders did, yet ignore the dragons, assuming that they were \\nnothing more than an exotic means to get from one town to another. They \\nweren’t. The Riders’ great deeds were only possible because of the dragons. How \\nmany men would draw their swords if they knew a giant fire-breathing lizard—one \\nwith more natural cunning and wisdom than even a king could hope for—would soon \\nbe there to stop the violence? Hmm?” He blew another smoke ring and watched it \\nwaft away.\\n“Did you ever \\nsee one?”\\n“Nay,” said \\nBrom, “it was long before my time.”\\nAnd now for a \\nname.“I’ve \\nbeen trying to recall the name of a certain dragon, but it keeps eluding me. I \\nthink I heard it when the traders were in Carvahall, but I’m not sure. Could \\nyou help me?”\\nBrom shrugged \\nand quickly listed a stream of names. “There was Jura, Hírador, and Fundor—who \\nfought the giant sea snake. Galzra, Briam, Ohen the Strong, Gretiem, Beroan, \\nRoslarb . . .” He added many others. At the very end, he uttered so softly \\nEragon almost did not hear, “. . . and Saphira.” Brom quietly emptied his pipe. \\n“Was it any of those?”\\n“I’m afraid \\nnot,” said Eragon. Brom had given him much to think about, and it was getting \\nlate. “Well, Roran’s probably finished with Horst. I should get back, though \\nI’d rather not.”\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “What, is that it? I expected to be answering your questions until he \\ncame looking for you. No queries about dragon battle tactics or requests for \\ndescriptions of breathtaking aerial combat? Are we done?”\\n“For now,” \\nlaughed Eragon. “I learned what I wanted to and more.” He stood and Brom \\nfollowed.\\n“Very well, \\nthen.” He ushered Eragon to the door. “Goodbye. Take care. And don’t forget, if \\nyou remember who that trader was, tell me.”\\n“I will. Thank \\nyou.” Eragon stepped into the glaring winter sunlight, squinting. He slowly \\npaced away, pondering what he had heard.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 12': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAN AME OFPOWER\\nOn the way home \\nRoran said, “There was a stranger from Therinsford at Horst’s today.”\\n“What’s his \\nname?” asked Eragon. He sidestepped a patch of ice and continued walking at a \\nbrisk pace. His cheeks and eyes burned from the cold.\\n“Dempton. He \\ncame here to have Horst forge him some sockets,” said Roran. His stocky legs \\nplowed through a drift, clearing the way for Eragon.\\n“Doesn’t \\nTherinsford have its own smith?”\\n“Yes,” replied \\nRoran, “but he isn’t skilled enough.” He glanced at Eragon. With a shrug he \\nadded, “Dempton needs the sockets for his mill. He’s expanding it and offered \\nme a job. If I accept, I’ll leave with him when he picks up the sockets.”\\nMillers worked \\nall year. During winter they ground whatever people brought them, but in \\nharvest season they bought grain and sold it as flour. It was hard, dangerous \\nwork; workers often lost fingers or hands to the giant millstones. “Are you \\ngoing to tell Garrow?” asked Eragon.\\n“Yes.” A grimly \\namused smile played across Roran’s face.\\n“What for? You \\nknow what he thinks about us going away. It’ll only cause trouble if you say \\nanything. Forget about it so we can eat tonight’s dinner in peace.”\\n“I can’t. I’m \\ngoing to take the job.”\\nEragon halted. \\n“Why?” They faced each other, their breath visible in the air. “I know money is \\nhard to come by, but we always manage to survive. You don’t have to leave.”\\n“No, I don’t. \\nBut the money is for myself.” Roran tried to resume walking, but Eragon refused \\nto budge.\\n“What do you \\nneed it for?” he demanded.\\nRoran’s \\nshoulders straightened slightly. “I want to marry.”\\nBewilderment and \\nastonishment overwhelmed Eragon. He remembered seeing Katrina and Roran kissing \\nduring the traders’ visit, but marriage? “Katrina?” he asked weakly, just to \\nconfirm. Roran nodded. “Have you asked her?”\\n“Not yet, but \\ncome spring, when I can raise a house, I will.”\\n“There’s too \\nmuch work on the farm for you to leave now,” protested Eragon. “Wait until \\nwe’re ready for planting.”\\n“No,” said \\nRoran, laughing slightly. “Spring’s the time I’ll be needed the most. The \\nground will have to be furrowed and sown. The crops must be weeded—not to \\nmention all the other chores. No, this is the best time for me to go, when all \\nwe really do is wait for the seasons to change. You and Garrow can make do \\nwithout me. If all goes well, I’ll soon be back working on the farm, with a \\nwife.”\\nEragon \\nreluctantly conceded that Roran made sense. He shook his head, but whether with \\namazement or anger, he knew not. “I guess I can only wish you the best of luck. \\nBut Garrow may take this with ill humor.”\\n“We will see.”\\nThey resumed \\nwalking, the silence a barrier between them. Eragon’s heart was disturbed. It \\nwould take time before he could look upon this development with favor. When \\nthey arrived home, Roran did not tell Garrow of his plans, but Eragon was sure \\nthat he soon would.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon went to \\nsee the dragon for the first time since it had spoken to him. He approached \\napprehensively, aware now that it was an equal.\\nEragon. \\n“Is that all you \\ncan say?” he snapped.\\nYes. \\nHis eyes widened \\nat the unexpected reply, and he sat down roughly.Now it has a sense of \\nhumor. What next? Impulsively, he broke a dead branch with his foot. \\nRoran’s announcement had put him in a foul mood. A questioning thought came \\nfrom the dragon, so he told it what had happened. As he talked his voice grew \\nsteadily louder until he was yelling pointlessly into the air. He ranted until \\nhis emotions were spent, then ineffectually punched the ground.\\n“I don’t want \\nhim to go, that’s all,” he said helplessly. The dragon watched impassively, \\nlistening and learning. Eragon mumbled a few choice curses and rubbed his eyes. \\nHe looked at the dragon thoughtfully. “You need a name. I heard some \\ninteresting ones today; perhaps you’ll like one.” He mentally ran through the \\nlist Brom had given him until he found two names that struck him as heroic, \\nnoble, and pleasing to the ear. “What do you think of Vanilor or his successor, \\nEridor? Both were great dragons.”\\nNo,said the dragon. \\nIt sounded amused with his efforts.Eragon.\\n“That’smy \\nname; you can’t have it,” he said, rubbing his chin. “Well, if you don’t like \\nthose, there are others.” He continued through the list, but the dragon \\nrejected every one he proposed. It seemed to be laughing at something Eragon \\ndid not understand, but he ignored it and kept suggesting names. “There was \\nIngothold, he slew the . . .” A revelation stopped him.That’s the problem! \\nI’ve been choosing male names. You are a she!\\nYes.The dragon \\nfolded her wings smugly.\\nNow that he knew \\nwhat to look for, he came up with half a dozen names. He toyed with Miremel, \\nbut that did not fit—after all, it was the name of a brown dragon. Opheila and \\nLenora were also discarded. He was about to give up when he remembered the last \\nname Brom had muttered. Eragon liked it, but would the dragon?\\nHe asked.\\n“Are you \\nSaphira?” She looked at him with intelligent eyes. Deep in his mind he felt her \\nsatisfaction.\\nYes.Something \\nclicked in his head and her voice echoed, as if from a great distance. He \\ngrinned in response. Saphira started humming.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 13': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAM ILLER-TO-BE\\nThe sun had set \\nby the time dinner was served. A blustery wind howled outside, shaking the \\nhouse. Eragon eyed Roran closely and waited for the inevitable. Finally: “I was \\noffered a job at Therinsford’s mill . . . which I plan to take.”\\nGarrow finished \\nhis mouthful of food with deliberate slowness and laid down his fork. He leaned \\nback in his chair, then interlaced his fingers behind his head and uttered one \\ndry word, “Why?”\\nRoran explained \\nwhile Eragon absently picked at his food.\\n“I see,” was \\nGarrow’s only comment. He fell silent and stared at the ceiling. No one moved \\nas they awaited his response. “Well, when do you leave?”\\n“What?” asked \\nRoran.\\nGarrow leaned \\nforward with a twinkle in his eye. “Did you think I would stop you? I’d hoped \\nyou would marry soon. It will be good to see this family growing again. Katrina \\nwill be lucky to have you.” Astonishment raced over Roran’s face, then he \\nsettled into a relieved grin. “So when do you leave?” Garrow asked.\\nRoran regained \\nhis voice. “When Dempton returns to get the sockets for the mill.”\\nGarrow nodded. \\n“And that will be in . . . ?”\\n“Two weeks.”\\n“Good. That will \\ngive us time to prepare. It’ll be different to have the house to ourselves. But \\nif nothing goes amiss, it shouldn’t be for too long.” He looked over the table \\nand asked, “Eragon, did you know of this?”\\nHe shrugged \\nruefully. “Not until today. . . . It’s madness.”\\nGarrow ran a \\nhand over his face. “It’s life’s natural course.” He pushed himself up from the \\nchair. “All will be fine; time will settle everything. For now, though, let’s \\nclean the dishes.” Eragon and Roran helped him in silence.\\n\\xa0\\nThe next few \\ndays were trying. Eragon’s temper was frayed. Except for curtly answering \\ndirect questions, he spoke with no one. There were small reminders everywhere \\nthat Roran was leaving: Garrow making him a pack, things missing from the \\nwalls, and a strange emptiness that filled the house. It was almost a week \\nbefore he realized that distance had grown between Roran and him. When they \\nspoke, the words did not come easily and their conversations were \\nuncomfortable.\\nSaphira was a \\nbalm for Eragon’s frustration. He could talk freely with her; his emotions were \\ncompletely open to her mind, and she understood him better than anyone else. \\nDuring the weeks before Roran’s departure, she went through another growth \\nspurt. She gained twelve inches at the shoulder, which was now higher than \\nEragon’s. He found that the small hollow where her neck joined her shoulders \\nwas a perfect place to sit. He often rested there in the evenings and scratched \\nher neck while he explained the meanings of different words. Soon she \\nunderstood everything he said and frequently commented on it.\\nFor Eragon, this \\npart of his life was delightful. Saphira was as real and complex as any person. \\nHer personality was eclectic and at times completely alien, yet they understood \\neach other on a profound level. Her actions and thoughts constantly revealed \\nnew aspects of her character. Once she caught an eagle and, instead of eating \\nit, released it, saying,No hunter of the sky should end his days as prey. \\nBetter to die on the wing than pinned to the ground.\\nEragon’s plan to \\nlet his family see Saphira was dispelled by Roran’s announcement and Saphira’s \\nown cautionary words. She was reluctant to be seen, and he, partly out of selfishness, \\nagreed. The moment her existence was divulged, he knew that shouts, \\naccusations, and fear would be directed at him . . . so he procrastinated. He \\ntold himself to wait for a sign that it was the right time.\\nThe night before \\nRoran was to leave, Eragon went to talk with him. He stalked down the hallway \\nto Roran’s open door. An oil lamp rested on a nightstand, painting the walls \\nwith warm flickering light. The bedposts cast elongated shadows on empty \\nshelves that rose to the ceiling. Roran—his eyes shaded and the back of his \\nneck tense—was rolling blankets around his clothes and belongings. He paused, \\nthen picked up something from the pillow and bounced it in his hand. It was a \\npolished rock Eragon had given him years ago. Roran started to tuck it into the \\nbundle, then stopped and set it on a shelf. A hard lump formed in Eragon’s \\nthroat, and he left.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 14': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nS TRANGERS INCARVAHALL\\nBreakfast was \\ncold, but the tea was hot. Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning \\nfire and soaked into the wood floor, staining it with dark puddles. Eragon \\nlooked at Garrow and Roran by the kitchen stove and reflected that this would \\nbe the last time he saw them together for many months.\\nRoran sat in a \\nchair, lacing his boots. His full pack rested on the floor next to him. Garrow \\nstood between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets. His shirt hung \\nloosely; his skin looked drawn. Despite the young men’s cajoling, he refused to \\ngo with them. When pressed for a reason, he only said that it was for the best.\\n“Do you have \\neverything?” Garrow asked Roran.\\n“Yes.”\\nHe nodded and \\ntook a small pouch from his pocket. Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran. \\n“I’ve been saving this for you. It isn’t much, but if you wish to buy some \\nbauble or trinket, it will suffice.”\\n“Thank you, but \\nI won’t be spending my money on trifles,” said Roran.\\n“Do what you \\nwill; it is yours,” said Garrow. “I’ve nothing else to give you, except a \\nfather’s blessing. Take it if you wish, but it is worth little.”\\nRoran’s voice \\nwas thick with emotion. “I would be honored to receive it.”\\n“Then do, and go \\nin peace,” said Garrow, and kissed him on the forehead. He turned and said in a \\nlouder voice, “Do not think that I have forgotten you, Eragon. I have words for \\nboth of you. It’s time I said them, as you are entering the world. Heed them \\nand they will serve you well.” He bent his gaze sternly on them. “First, let no \\none rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain \\nunfettered. One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave. Give \\nmen your ear, but not your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don’t \\nfollow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not.\\n“Consider none \\nyour superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they \\nwill seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and \\nothers will listen.” He continued at a slower pace, “Of the affairs of love . . \\n. my only advice is to be honest. That’s your most powerful tool to unlock a \\nheart or gain forgiveness. That is all I have to say.” He seemed slightly \\nself-conscious of his speech.\\nHe hoisted \\nRoran’s pack. “Now you must go. Dawn is approaching, and Dempton will be \\nwaiting.”\\nRoran shouldered \\nthe pack and hugged Garrow. “I will return as soon as I can,” he said.\\n“Good!” replied \\nGarrow. “But now go and don’t worry about us.”\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. Eragon and Roran went outside, then turned and waved. Garrow \\nraised a bony hand, his eyes grave, and watched as they trudged to the road. \\nAfter a long moment he shut the door. As the sound carried through the morning \\nair, Roran halted.\\nEragon looked \\nback and surveyed the land. His eyes lingered on the lone buildings. They \\nlooked pitifully small and fragile. A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the \\nhouse was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited.\\n“There is our \\nwhole world,” Roran observed somberly.\\nEragon shivered \\nimpatiently and grumbled, “A good one too.” Roran nodded, then straightened his \\nshoulders and headed into his new future. The house disappeared from view as \\nthey descended the hill.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was still \\nearly when they reached Carvahall, but they found the smithy doors already \\nopen. The air inside was pleasantly warm. Baldor slowly worked two large \\nbellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals. \\nBefore the forge stood a black anvil and an iron-bound barrel filled with \\nbrine. From a line of neck-high poles protruding from the walls hung rows of \\nitems: giant tongs, pliers, hammers in every shape and weight, chisels, angles, \\ncenter punches, files, rasps, lathes, bars of iron and steel waiting to be \\nshaped, vises, shears, picks, and shovels. Horst and Dempton stood next to a \\nlong table.\\nDempton \\napproached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache. “Roran! I’m glad \\nyou came. There’s going to be more work than I can handle with my new \\ngrindstones. Are you ready to go?”\\nRoran hefted his \\npack. “Yes. Do we leave soon?”\\n“I’ve a few \\nthings to take care of first, but we’ll be off within the hour.” Eragon shifted \\nhis feet as Dempton turned to him, tugging at the corner of his mustache. “You \\nmust be Eragon. I would offer you a job too, but Roran got the only one. Maybe \\nin a year or two, eh?”\\nEragon smiled \\nuneasily and shook his hand. The man was friendly. Under other circumstances \\nEragon would have liked him, but right then, he sourly wished that the miller \\nhad never come to Carvahall. Dempton huffed. “Good, very good.” He returned his \\nattention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked.\\n“They’re ready \\nto go,” interrupted Horst, gesturing at the table where several bundles rested. \\n“You can take them whenever you want to.” They shook hands, then Horst left the \\nsmithy, beckoning to Eragon on the way out.\\nInterested, \\nEragon followed. He found the smith standing in the street with his arms \\ncrossed. Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked, “What do you \\nthink of him?”\\nHorst rumbled, \\n“A good man. He’ll do fine with Roran.” He absently brushed metal filings off \\nhis apron, then put a massive hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Lad, do you remember \\nthe fight you had with Sloan?”\\n“If you’re \\nasking about payment for the meat, I haven’t forgotten.”\\n“No, I trust \\nyou, lad. What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone.”\\nEragon’s heart \\nfluttered.Why does he want to know? Maybe someone saw Saphira! \\nStruggling not to panic, he said, “I do, but why do you ask?”\\n“As soon as you \\nreturn home, get rid of it.” Horst overrode Eragon’s exclamation. “Two men \\narrived here yesterday. Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords. \\nIt made my skin crawl just to look at them. Last evening they started asking \\npeople if a stone like yours had been found. They’re at it again today.” Eragon \\nblanched. “No one with any sense said anything. They know trouble when they see \\nit, but I could name a few people who will talk.”\\nDread filled \\nEragon’s heart. Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked \\nit down. Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira. He did not know which \\nwould be worse.Think! Think! The egg is gone. It’s impossible for them to \\nfind it now. But if they know what it was, it’ll be obvious what happened. . . \\n. Saphira might be in danger! It took all of his self-control to retain a \\ncasual air. “Thanks for telling me. Do you know where they are?” He was proud \\nthat his voice barely trembled.\\n“I didn’t warn \\nyou because I thought you needed to meet those men! Leave Carvahall. Go home.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid Eragon to placate the smith, “if you think I should.”\\n“I do.” Horst’s \\nface softened. “I may be overreacting, but these strangers give me a bad \\nfeeling. It would be better if you stay home until they leave. I’ll try to keep \\nthem away from your farm, though it may not do any good.”\\nEragon looked at \\nhim gratefully. He wished he could tell him about Saphira. “I’ll leave now,” he \\nsaid, and hurried back to Roran. Eragon clasped his cousin’s arm and bade him \\nfarewell.\\n“Aren’t you \\ngoing to stay awhile?” Roran asked with surprise.\\nEragon almost \\nlaughed. For some reason, the question struck him as funny. “There’s nothing \\nfor me to do, and I’m not going to stand around until you go.”\\n“Well,” said \\nRoran doubtfully, “I guess this is the last time we’ll see each other for a few \\nmonths.”\\n“I’m sure it \\nwon’t seem that long,” said Eragon hastily. “Take care and come back soon.” He \\nhugged Roran, then left. Horst was still in the street. Aware that the smith \\nwas watching, Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall. Once the smithy was \\nout of sight, he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village.\\nEragon kept to \\nthe shadows as he searched each street, listening for the slightest noise. His \\nthoughts flashed to his room, where his bow hung; he wished that it was in his \\nhand. He prowled across Carvahall, avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant \\nvoice from around a house. Although his ears were keen, he had to strain to \\nhear what was being said.\\n“When did this \\nhappen?” The words were smooth, like oiled glass, and seemed to worm their way \\nthrough the air. Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp \\nprickle.\\n“About three \\nmonths ago,” someone else answered. Eragon identified him as Sloan.\\nShade’s blood, \\nhe’s telling them. . . .He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met.\\nA third person \\nspoke. The voice was deep and moist. It conjured up images of creeping decay, \\nmold, and other things best left untouched. “Are you sure? We would hate to \\nthink you had made a mistake. If that were so, it would be most . . . \\nunpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do. Would \\nanyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that? Probably not, but whoever \\nsent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity.\\n“Yeah, I’m sure. \\nHe had it then. I’m not lying. Plenty of people know about it. Go ask them.” \\nSloan sounded shaken. He said something else that Eragon did not catch.\\n“They have been \\n. . . rather uncooperative.” The words were derisive. There was a pause. “Your \\ninformation has been helpful. We will not forget you.” Eragon believed him.\\nSloan muttered \\nsomething, then Eragon heard someone hurrying away. He peered around the corner \\nto see what was happening. Two tall men stood in the street. Both were dressed \\nin long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs. On \\ntheir shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread. Hoods \\nshaded their faces, and their hands were covered by gloves. Their backs were \\noddly humped, as though their clothes were stuffed with padding.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly to get a better view. One of the strangers stiffened and grunted \\npeculiarly to his companion. They both swiveled around and sank into crouches. \\nEragon’s breath caught. Mortal fear clenched him. His eyes locked onto their \\nhidden faces, and a stifling power fell over his mind, keeping him in place. He \\nstruggled against it and screamed to himself,Move! His legs swayed, but \\nto no avail. The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth, noiseless gait. He \\nknew they could see his face now. They were almost to the corner, hands \\ngrasping at swords. . . .\\n“Eragon!” He \\njerked as his name was called. The strangers froze in place and hissed. Brom \\nhurried toward him from the side, head bare and staff in hand. The strangers \\nwere blocked from the old man’s view. Eragon tried to warn him, but his tongue \\nand arms would not stir. “Eragon!” cried Brom again. The strangers gave Eragon \\none last look, then slipped away between the houses.\\nEragon collapsed \\nto the ground, shivering. Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms \\nsticky. The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm. \\n“You look sick; is all well?”\\nEragon gulped \\nand nodded mutely. His eyes flickered around, searching for anything unusual. \\n“I just got dizzy all of a sudden . . . it’s passed. It was very odd—I don’t \\nknow why it happened.”\\n“You’ll \\nrecover,” said Brom, “but perhaps it would be better if you went home.”\\nYes, I have to \\nget home! Have to get there before they do.“I think you’re right. Maybe I’m \\ngetting ill.”\\n“Then home is \\nthe best place for you. It’s a long walk, but I’m sure you will feel better by \\nthe time you arrive. Let me escort you to the road.” Eragon did not protest as \\nBrom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace. Brom’s staff crunched in \\nthe snow as they passed the houses.\\n“Why were you \\nlooking for me?”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“Simple curiosity. I learned you were in town and wondered if you had \\nremembered the name of that trader.”\\nTrader? What’s \\nhe talking about?Eragon \\nstared blankly; his confusion caught the attention of Brom’s probing eyes. \\n“No,” he said, and then amended himself, “I’m afraid I still don’t remember.”\\nBrom sighed \\ngruffly, as if something had been confirmed, and rubbed his eagle nose. “Well, \\nthen . . . if you do, come tell me. I am most interested in this trader who \\npretends to know so much about dragons.” Eragon nodded with a distracted air. \\nThey walked in silence to the road, then Brom said, “Hasten home. I don’t think \\nit would be a good idea to tarry on the way.” He offered a gnarled hand.\\nEragon shook it, \\nbut as he let go something in Brom’s hand caught on his mitt and pulled it off. \\nIt fell to the ground. The old man picked it up. “Clumsy of me,” he apologized, \\nand handed it back. As Eragon took the mitt, Brom’s strong fingers wrapped \\naround his wrist and twisted sharply. His palm briefly faced upward, revealing \\nthe silvery mark. Brom’s eyes glinted, but he let Eragon yank his hand back and \\njam it into the mitt.\\n“Goodbye,” \\nEragon forced out, perturbed, and hurried down the road. Behind him he heard \\nBrom whistling a merry tune.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 15': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nSTRANGERS INCARVAHALL\\nBreakfast was \\ncold, but the tea was hot. Ice inside the windows had melted with the morning \\nfire and soaked into the wood floor, staining it with dark puddles. Eragon \\nlooked at Garrow and Roran by the kitchen stove and reflected that this would \\nbe the last time he saw them together for many months.\\nRoran sat in a \\nchair, lacing his boots. His full pack rested on the floor next to him. Garrow \\nstood between them with his hands stuck deep into his pockets. His shirt hung \\nloosely; his skin looked drawn. Despite the young men’s cajoling, he refused to \\ngo with them. When pressed for a reason, he only said that it was for the best.\\n“Do you have \\neverything?” Garrow asked Roran.\\n“Yes.”\\nHe nodded and \\ntook a small pouch from his pocket. Coins clinked as he handed it to Roran. \\n“I’ve been saving this for you. It isn’t much, but if you wish to buy some \\nbauble or trinket, it will suffice.”\\n“Thank you, but \\nI won’t be spending my money on trifles,” said Roran.\\n“Do what you \\nwill; it is yours,” said Garrow. “I’ve nothing else to give you, except a \\nfather’s blessing. Take it if you wish, but it is worth little.”\\nRoran’s voice \\nwas thick with emotion. “I would be honored to receive it.”\\n“Then do, and go \\nin peace,” said Garrow, and kissed him on the forehead. He turned and said in a \\nlouder voice, “Do not think that I have forgotten you, Eragon. I have words for \\nboth of you. It’s time I said them, as you are entering the world. Heed them \\nand they will serve you well.” He bent his gaze sternly on them. “First, let no \\none rule your mind or body. Take special care that your thoughts remain \\nunfettered. One may be a free man and yet be bound tighter than a slave. Give \\nmen your ear, but not your heart. Show respect for those in power, but don’t \\nfollow them blindly. Judge with logic and reason, but comment not.\\n“Consider none \\nyour superior, whatever their rank or station in life. Treat all fairly or they \\nwill seek revenge. Be careful with your money. Hold fast to your beliefs and \\nothers will listen.” He continued at a slower pace, “Of the affairs of love . . \\n. my only advice is to be honest. That’s your most powerful tool to unlock a \\nheart or gain forgiveness. That is all I have to say.” He seemed slightly \\nself-conscious of his speech.\\nHe hoisted \\nRoran’s pack. “Now you must go. Dawn is approaching, and Dempton will be \\nwaiting.”\\nRoran shouldered \\nthe pack and hugged Garrow. “I will return as soon as I can,” he said.\\n“Good!” replied \\nGarrow. “But now go and don’t worry about us.”\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. Eragon and Roran went outside, then turned and waved. Garrow \\nraised a bony hand, his eyes grave, and watched as they trudged to the road. \\nAfter a long moment he shut the door. As the sound carried through the morning \\nair, Roran halted.\\nEragon looked \\nback and surveyed the land. His eyes lingered on the lone buildings. They \\nlooked pitifully small and fragile. A thin finger of smoke trailing up from the \\nhouse was the only proof that the snowbound farm was inhabited.\\n“There is our \\nwhole world,” Roran observed somberly.\\nEragon shivered \\nimpatiently and grumbled, “A good one too.” Roran nodded, then straightened his \\nshoulders and headed into his new future. The house disappeared from view as \\nthey descended the hill.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was still \\nearly when they reached Carvahall, but they found the smithy doors already \\nopen. The air inside was pleasantly warm. Baldor slowly worked two large \\nbellows attached to the side of a stone forge filled with sparkling coals. \\nBefore the forge stood a black anvil and an iron-bound barrel filled with \\nbrine. From a line of neck-high poles protruding from the walls hung rows of \\nitems: giant tongs, pliers, hammers in every shape and weight, chisels, angles, \\ncenter punches, files, rasps, lathes, bars of iron and steel waiting to be \\nshaped, vises, shears, picks, and shovels. Horst and Dempton stood next to a \\nlong table.\\nDempton \\napproached with a smile beneath his flamboyant red mustache. “Roran! I’m glad \\nyou came. There’s going to be more work than I can handle with my new \\ngrindstones. Are you ready to go?”\\nRoran hefted his \\npack. “Yes. Do we leave soon?”\\n“I’ve a few \\nthings to take care of first, but we’ll be off within the hour.” Eragon shifted \\nhis feet as Dempton turned to him, tugging at the corner of his mustache. “You \\nmust be Eragon. I would offer you a job too, but Roran got the only one. Maybe \\nin a year or two, eh?”\\nEragon smiled \\nuneasily and shook his hand. The man was friendly. Under other circumstances \\nEragon would have liked him, but right then, he sourly wished that the miller \\nhad never come to Carvahall. Dempton huffed. “Good, very good.” He returned his \\nattention to Roran and started to explain how a mill worked.\\n“They’re ready \\nto go,” interrupted Horst, gesturing at the table where several bundles rested. \\n“You can take them whenever you want to.” They shook hands, then Horst left the \\nsmithy, beckoning to Eragon on the way out.\\nInterested, \\nEragon followed. He found the smith standing in the street with his arms \\ncrossed. Eragon thrust his thumb back toward the miller and asked, “What do you \\nthink of him?”\\nHorst rumbled, \\n“A good man. He’ll do fine with Roran.” He absently brushed metal filings off \\nhis apron, then put a massive hand on Eragon’s shoulder. “Lad, do you remember \\nthe fight you had with Sloan?”\\n“If you’re \\nasking about payment for the meat, I haven’t forgotten.”\\n“No, I trust \\nyou, lad. What I wanted to know is if you still have that blue stone.”\\nEragon’s heart \\nfluttered.Why does he want to know? Maybe someone saw Saphira! \\nStruggling not to panic, he said, “I do, but why do you ask?”\\n“As soon as you \\nreturn home, get rid of it.” Horst overrode Eragon’s exclamation. “Two men \\narrived here yesterday. Strange fellows dressed in black and carrying swords. \\nIt made my skin crawl just to look at them. Last evening they started asking \\npeople if a stone like yours had been found. They’re at it again today.” Eragon \\nblanched. “No one with any sense said anything. They know trouble when they see \\nit, but I could name a few people who will talk.”\\nDread filled \\nEragon’s heart. Whoever had sent the stone into the Spine had finally tracked \\nit down. Or perhaps the Empire had learned of Saphira. He did not know which \\nwould be worse.Think! Think! The egg is gone. It’s impossible for them to \\nfind it now. But if they know what it was, it’ll be obvious what happened. . . \\n. Saphira might be in danger! It took all of his self-control to retain a \\ncasual air. “Thanks for telling me. Do you know where they are?” He was proud \\nthat his voice barely trembled.\\n“I didn’t warn \\nyou because I thought you needed to meet those men! Leave Carvahall. Go home.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid Eragon to placate the smith, “if you think I should.”\\n“I do.” Horst’s \\nface softened. “I may be overreacting, but these strangers give me a bad \\nfeeling. It would be better if you stay home until they leave. I’ll try to keep \\nthem away from your farm, though it may not do any good.”\\nEragon looked at \\nhim gratefully. He wished he could tell him about Saphira. “I’ll leave now,” he \\nsaid, and hurried back to Roran. Eragon clasped his cousin’s arm and bade him \\nfarewell.\\n“Aren’t you \\ngoing to stay awhile?” Roran asked with surprise.\\nEragon almost \\nlaughed. For some reason, the question struck him as funny. “There’s nothing \\nfor me to do, and I’m not going to stand around until you go.”\\n“Well,” said \\nRoran doubtfully, “I guess this is the last time we’ll see each other for a few \\nmonths.”\\n“I’m sure it \\nwon’t seem that long,” said Eragon hastily. “Take care and come back soon.” He \\nhugged Roran, then left. Horst was still in the street. Aware that the smith \\nwas watching, Eragon headed to the outskirts of Carvahall. Once the smithy was \\nout of sight, he ducked behind a house and sneaked back through the village.\\nEragon kept to \\nthe shadows as he searched each street, listening for the slightest noise. His \\nthoughts flashed to his room, where his bow hung; he wished that it was in his \\nhand. He prowled across Carvahall, avoiding everyone until he heard a sibilant \\nvoice from around a house. Although his ears were keen, he had to strain to \\nhear what was being said.\\n“When did this \\nhappen?” The words were smooth, like oiled glass, and seemed to worm their way \\nthrough the air. Underlying the speech was a strange hiss that made his scalp \\nprickle.\\n“About three \\nmonths ago,” someone else answered. Eragon identified him as Sloan.\\nShade’s blood, \\nhe’s telling them. . . .He resolved to punch Sloan the next time they met.\\nA third person \\nspoke. The voice was deep and moist. It conjured up images of creeping decay, \\nmold, and other things best left untouched. “Are you sure? We would hate to \\nthink you had made a mistake. If that were so, it would be most . . . \\nunpleasant.” Eragon could imagine only too well what they might do. Would \\nanyone but the Empire dare threaten people like that? Probably not, but whoever \\nsent the egg might be powerful enough to use force with impunity.\\n“Yeah, I’m sure. \\nHe had it then. I’m not lying. Plenty of people know about it. Go ask them.” \\nSloan sounded shaken. He said something else that Eragon did not catch.\\n“They have been \\n. . . rather uncooperative.” The words were derisive. There was a pause. “Your \\ninformation has been helpful. We will not forget you.” Eragon believed him.\\nSloan muttered \\nsomething, then Eragon heard someone hurrying away. He peered around the corner \\nto see what was happening. Two tall men stood in the street. Both were dressed \\nin long black cloaks that were lifted by sheaths poking past their legs. On \\ntheir shirts were insignias intricately wrought with silver thread. Hoods \\nshaded their faces, and their hands were covered by gloves. Their backs were \\noddly humped, as though their clothes were stuffed with padding.\\nEragon shifted \\nslightly to get a better view. One of the strangers stiffened and grunted \\npeculiarly to his companion. They both swiveled around and sank into crouches. \\nEragon’s breath caught. Mortal fear clenched him. His eyes locked onto their \\nhidden faces, and a stifling power fell over his mind, keeping him in place. He \\nstruggled against it and screamed to himself,Move! His legs swayed, but \\nto no avail. The strangers stalked toward him with a smooth, noiseless gait. He \\nknew they could see his face now. They were almost to the corner, hands \\ngrasping at swords. . . .\\n“Eragon!” He \\njerked as his name was called. The strangers froze in place and hissed. Brom \\nhurried toward him from the side, head bare and staff in hand. The strangers \\nwere blocked from the old man’s view. Eragon tried to warn him, but his tongue \\nand arms would not stir. “Eragon!” cried Brom again. The strangers gave Eragon \\none last look, then slipped away between the houses.\\nEragon collapsed \\nto the ground, shivering. Sweat beaded on his forehead and made his palms \\nsticky. The old man offered Eragon a hand and pulled him up with a strong arm. \\n“You look sick; is all well?”\\nEragon gulped \\nand nodded mutely. His eyes flickered around, searching for anything unusual. \\n“I just got dizzy all of a sudden . . . it’s passed. It was very odd—I don’t \\nknow why it happened.”\\n“You’ll \\nrecover,” said Brom, “but perhaps it would be better if you went home.”\\nYes, I have to \\nget home! Have to get there before they do.“I think you’re right. Maybe I’m \\ngetting ill.”\\n“Then home is \\nthe best place for you. It’s a long walk, but I’m sure you will feel better by \\nthe time you arrive. Let me escort you to the road.” Eragon did not protest as \\nBrom took his arm and led him away at a quick pace. Brom’s staff crunched in \\nthe snow as they passed the houses.\\n“Why were you \\nlooking for me?”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“Simple curiosity. I learned you were in town and wondered if you had \\nremembered the name of that trader.”\\nTrader? What’s \\nhe talking about?Eragon \\nstared blankly; his confusion caught the attention of Brom’s probing eyes. \\n“No,” he said, and then amended himself, “I’m afraid I still don’t remember.”\\nBrom sighed \\ngruffly, as if something had been confirmed, and rubbed his eagle nose. “Well, \\nthen . . . if you do, come tell me.

Behind him he heard \\nBrom whistling a merry tune.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 16': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nF LIGHT OFDESTINY\\nEragon’s mind \\nchurned as he sped on his way. He ran as fast as he could, refusing to stop \\neven when his breath came in great gasps. As he pounded down the cold road, he \\ncast out with his mind for Saphira, but she was too far away for him to \\ncontact. He thought about what to say to Garrow. There was no choice now; he \\nwould have to reveal Saphira.\\nHe arrived home, \\npanting for air and heart pounding. Garrow stood by the barn with the horses. \\nEragon hesitated. Should I talk to him now? He won’t believe me unless \\nSaphira is here—I’d better find her first.He slipped around the farm and \\ninto the forest.Saphira! he shouted with his thoughts.\\nI come,was the dim reply. \\nThrough the words he sensed her alarm. He waited impatiently, though it was not \\nlong before the sound of her wings filled the air. She landed amid a gout of \\nsmoke.What happened? she queried.\\nHe touched her \\nshoulder and closed his eyes. Calming his mind, he quickly told her what had \\noccurred. When he mentioned the strangers, Saphira recoiled. She reared and \\nroared deafeningly, then whipped her tail over his head. He scrambled back in \\nsurprise, ducking as her tail hit a snowdrift. Bloodlust and fear emanated from \\nher in great sickening waves.Fire! Enemies! Death! Murderers!\\nWhat’s wrong?He put all of \\nhis strength into the words, but an iron wall surrounded her mind, shielding \\nher thoughts. She let out another roar and gouged the earth with her claws, \\ntearing the frozen ground.Stop it! Garrow will hear!\\nOaths betrayed, \\nsouls killed, eggs shattered! Blood everywhere. Murderers! \\nFrantic, he \\nblocked out Saphira’s emotions and watched her tail. When it flicked past him, \\nhe dashed to her side and grabbed a spike on her back. Clutching it, he pulled \\nhimself into the small hollow at the base of her neck and held on tightly as \\nshe reared again. “Enough, Saphira!” he bellowed. Her stream of thoughts ceased \\nabruptly. He ran a hand over her scales. “Everything’s going to be all right.” \\nShe crouched and her wings rushed upward. They hung there for an instant, then \\ndrove down as she flung herself into the sky.\\nEragon yelled as \\nthe ground dropped away and they rose above the trees. Turbulence buffeted him, \\nsnatching the breath out of his mouth. Saphira ignored his terror and banked \\ntoward the Spine. Underneath, he glimpsed the farm and the Anora River. His \\nstomach convulsed. He tightened his arms around Saphira’s neck and concentrated \\non the scales in front of his nose, trying not to vomit as she continued to \\nclimb. When she leveled off, he gained the courage to glance around.\\nThe air was so \\ncold that frost accumulated on his eyelashes. They had reached the mountains faster \\nthan he thought possible. From the air, the peaks looked like giant razor-sharp \\nteeth waiting to slash them to ribbons. Saphira wobbled unexpectedly, and \\nEragon heaved over her side. He wiped his lips, tasting bile, and buried his \\nhead against her neck.\\nWe have to go \\nback,he \\npleaded.The strangers are coming to the farm.Garrow has to be warned. Turn \\naround! There was no answer. He reached for her mind, but was blocked by a \\nbarrier of roiling fear and anger. Determined to make her turn around, he grimly \\nwormed into her mental armor. He pushed at its weak places, undermined the \\nstronger sections, and fought to make her listen, but to no avail.\\nSoon mountains \\nsurrounded them, forming tremendous white walls broken by granite cliffs. Blue \\nglaciers sat between the summits like frozen rivers. Long valleys and ravines \\nopened beneath them. He heard the dismayed screech of birds far below as \\nSaphira soared into view. He saw a herd of woolly goats bounding from ledge to \\nledge on a rocky bluff.\\nEragon was \\nbattered by swirling gusts from Saphira’s wings, and whenever she moved her \\nneck, he was tossed from side to side. She seemed tireless. He was afraid she \\nwas going to fly through the night. Finally, as darkness fell, she tilted into \\na shallow dive.\\nHe looked ahead and \\nsaw that they were headed for a small clearing in a valley. Saphira spiraled \\ndown, leisurely drifting over the treetops. She pulled back as the ground \\nneared, filled her wings with air, and landed on her rear legs. Her powerful \\nmuscles rippled as they absorbed the shock of impact. She dropped to all fours \\nand skipped a step to keep her balance. Eragon slid off without waiting for her \\nto fold her wings.\\nAs he struck the \\nground, his knees buckled, and his cheek slammed against the snow. He gasped as \\nexcruciating pain seared through his legs, sending tears to his eyes. His \\nmuscles, cramped from clenching for so long, shook violently. He rolled onto \\nhis back, shivering, and stretched his limbs as best he could. Then he forced \\nhimself to look down. Two large blots darkened his wool pants on the insides of \\nhis thighs. He touched the fabric. It was wet. Alarmed, he peeled off the pants \\nand grimaced. The insides of his legs were raw and bloody. The skin was gone, \\nrubbed off by Saphira’s hard scales. He gingerly felt the abrasions and winced. \\nCold bit into him as he pulled the pants back on, and he cried out as they \\nscraped against the sensitive wounds. He tried to stand, but his legs would not \\nsupport him.\\nThe deepening \\nnight obscured his surroundings; the shaded mountains were unfamiliar. I’m \\nin the Spine, I don’t know where, during the middle of winter, with a crazed \\ndragon, unable to walk or find shelter. Night is falling. I have to get back to \\nthe farm tomorrow. And the only way to do that is to fly, which I can’t endure \\nanymore.He took a deep breath.Oh, I wish Saphira could breathe fire. \\nHe turned his head and saw her next to him, crouched low to the ground. He put \\na hand on her side and found it trembling. The barrier in her mind was gone. \\nWithout it, her fear scorched through him. He clamped down on it and slowly \\nsoothed her with gentle images.Why do the strangers frighten you?\\nMurderers, she hissed.\\nGarrow is in \\ndanger and you kidnap me on this ridiculous journey! Are you unable to protect \\nme?She \\ngrowled deeply and snapped her jaws.Ah, but if you think you can, why run?\\nDeath is a \\npoison.\\n\\nHe leaned on one \\nelbow and stifled his frustration.Saphira, look where we are! The sun is \\ndown, and your flight has stripped my legs as easily as I would scale a fish. \\nIs that what you wanted?\\nNo. \\nThen why did you \\ndo it?he \\ndemanded. Through his link with Saphira, he felt her regret for his pain, but \\nnot for her actions. She looked away and refused to answer. The icy temperature \\ndeadened Eragon’s legs; although it lessened the pain, he knew that his \\ncondition was not good. He changed tack.I’m going to freeze unless you make \\nme a shelter or hollow so I can stay warm. Even a pile of pine needles and \\nbranches would do.\\nShe seemed \\nrelieved that he had stopped interrogating her.There is no need. I will curl \\naround you and cover you with my wings—the fire inside me will stay the cold.\\nEragon let his \\nhead thump back on the ground.Fine, but scrape the snow off the ground. \\nIt’ll be more comfortable. In answer, Saphira razed a drift with her tail, \\nclearing it with one powerful stroke. She swept over the site again to remove \\nthe last few inches of hardened snow. He eyed the exposed dirt with distaste.I \\ncan’t walk over there. You’ll have to help me to it. Her head, larger than \\nhis torso, swung over him and came to rest by his side. He stared at her large, \\nsapphire-colored eyes and wrapped his hands around one of her ivory spikes. She \\nlifted her head and slowly dragged him to the bare spot.Gently, gently. \\nStars danced in his eyes as he slid over a rock, but he managed to hold on. \\nAfter he let go, Saphira rolled on her side, exposing her warm belly. He \\nhuddled against the smooth scales of her underside. Her right wing extended \\nover him and enclosed him in complete darkness, forming a living tent. Almost \\nimmediately the air began to lose its frigidity.\\nHe pulled his \\narms inside his coat and tied the empty sleeves around his neck. For the first \\ntime he noticed that hunger gnawed at his stomach. But it did not distract him \\nfrom his main worry: Could he get back to the farm before the strangers did? \\nAnd if not, what would happen?Even if I can force myself to ride Saphira \\nagain, it’ll be at least midafternoon before we get back. The strangers could \\nbe there long before that. He closed his eyes and felt a single tear slide \\ndown his face.What have I done?\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 17': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEDOOM OFINNOCENCE\\nWhen Eragon \\nopened his eyes in the morning, he thought the sky had fallen. An unbroken \\nplane of blue stretched over his head and slanted to the ground. Still half \\nasleep, he reached out tentatively and felt a thin membrane under his fingers. \\nIt took him a long minute to realize what he was staring at. He bent his neck \\nslightly and glared at the scaly haunch his head rested on. Slowly he pushed \\nhis legs out from his fetal curl, scabs cracking. The pain had subsided some \\nfrom yesterday, but he shrank from the thought of walking. Burning hunger \\nreminded him of his missed meals. He summoned the energy to move and pounded \\nweakly on Saphira’s side. “Hey! Wake up!” he yelled.\\nShe stirred and \\nlifted her wing to admit a torrent of sunshine. He squinted as the snow \\nmomentarily blinded him. Beside him Saphira stretched like a cat and yawned, \\nflashing rows of white teeth. When Eragon’s eyes adjusted, he examined where \\nthey were. Imposing and unfamiliar mountains surrounded them, casting deep \\nshadows on the clearing. Off to one side, he saw a trail cut through the snow \\nand into the forest, where he could hear the muffled gurgling of a creek.\\nGroaning, he \\nstood and swayed, then stiffly hobbled to a tree. He grabbed one of its \\nbranches and threw his weight against it. It held, then broke with a loud \\ncrack. He ripped off the twigs, fit one end of the branch under his arm, and \\nplanted the other firmly in the ground. With the help of his improvised crutch, \\nhe limped to the iced-over creek. He broke through the hard shell and cupped \\nthe clear, bitter water. Sated, he returned to the clearing. As he emerged from \\nthe trees, he finally recognized the mountains and the lay of the land.\\nThis was where, \\namid deafening sound, Saphira’s egg had first appeared. He sagged against a \\nrough trunk. There could be no mistake, for now he saw the gray trees that had \\nbeen stripped of their needles in the explosion.How did Saphira know where \\nthis was? She was still in the egg. My memories must have given her enough \\ninformation to find it. He shook his head in silent astonishment.\\nSaphira was \\nwaiting patiently for him.Will you take me home? he asked her. She \\ncocked her head.I know you don’t want to, but you must. Both of us carry an \\nobligation to Garrow. He has cared for me and, through me, you. Would you \\nignore that debt? What will be said of us in years to come if we don’t \\nreturn—that we hid like cowards while my uncle was in danger? I can hear it \\nnow, the story of the Rider and his craven dragon! If there will be a fight, \\nlet’s face it and not shy away. You are a dragon! Even a Shade would run from \\nyou! Yet you crouch in the mountains like a frightened rabbit.\\nEragon meant to \\nanger her, and he succeeded. A growl rippled in her throat as her head jabbed \\nwithin a few inches of his face. She bared her fangs and glared at him, smoke \\ntrailing from her nostrils. He hoped that he had not gone too far. Her thoughts \\nreached him, red with anger.Blood will meet blood. I will fight. Our wyrds—our \\nfates—bind us, but try me not. I will take you because of debt owed, but into \\nfoolishness we fly.\\n“Foolishness or \\nnot,” he said into the air, “there is no choice—we must go.” He ripped his \\nshirt in half and stuffed a piece into each side of his pants. Gingerly, he \\nhoisted himself onto Saphira and took a tight hold on her neck.This time, \\nhe told her,fly lower and faster. Time is of the essence.\\nDon’t let go,she cautioned, \\nthen surged into the sky. They rose above the forest and leveled out \\nimmediately, barely staying above the branches. Eragon’s stomach lurched; he \\nwas glad it was empty.\\nFaster, faster,he urged. She \\nsaid nothing, but the beat of her wings increased. He screwed his eyes shut and \\nhunched his shoulders. He had hoped that the extra padding of his shirt would \\nprotect him, but every movement sent pangs through his legs. Soon lines of hot \\nblood trickled down his calves. Concern emanated from Saphira. She went even \\nfaster now, her wings straining. The land sped past, as if it were being pulled \\nout from under them. Eragon imagined that to someone on the ground, they were \\njust a blur.\\nBy early \\nafternoon, Palancar Valley lay before them. Clouds obscured his vision to the \\nsouth; Carvahall was to the north. Saphira glided down while Eragon searched \\nfor the farm. When he spotted it, fear jolted him. A black plume with orange \\nflames dancing at its base rose from the farm.\\nSaphira!He pointed.Get \\nme down there. Now!\\nShe locked her \\nwings and tilted into a steep dive, hurtling groundward at a frightening rate. \\nThen she altered her dive slightly so they sped toward the forest. He yelled \\nover the screaming air, “Land in the fields!” He held on tighter as they \\nplummeted. Saphira waited until they were only a hundred feet off the ground \\nbefore driving her wings downward in several powerful strokes. She landed \\nheavily, breaking his grip. He crashed to the ground, then staggered upright, \\ngasping for breath.\\nThe house had \\nbeen blasted apart. Timbers and boards that had been walls and roof were strewn \\nacross a wide area. The wood was pulverized, as if a giant hammer had smashed \\nit. Sooty shingles lay everywhere. A few twisted metal plates were all that \\nremained of the stove. The snow was perforated with smashed white crockery and \\nchunks of bricks from the chimney. Thick, oily smoke billowed from the barn, \\nwhich burned fiercely. The farm animals were gone, either killed or frightened \\naway.\\n“Uncle!” Eragon \\nran to the wreckage, hunting through the destroyed rooms for Garrow. There was \\nno sign of him. “Uncle!” Eragon cried again. Saphira walked around the house \\nand came to his side.\\nSorrow breeds \\nhere,she \\nsaid.\\n“This wouldn’t \\nhave happened if you hadn’t run away with me!”\\nYou would not be \\nalive if we had stayed. \\n“Look at this!” \\nhe screamed. “We could’ve warned Garrow! It’s your fault he didn’t get away!” \\nHe slammed his fist against a pole, splitting the skin on his knuckles. Blood \\ndripped down his fingers as he stalked out of the house. He stumbled to the \\npath that led to the road and bent down to examine the snow. Several tracks \\nwere before him, but his vision was blurry and he could barely see.Am I \\ngoing blind? he wondered. With a shaking hand, he touched his cheeks and \\nfound them wet.\\nA shadow fell on \\nhim as Saphira loomed overhead, sheltering him with her wings.Take comfort; \\nall may not be lost. He looked up at her, searching for hope.Examine the \\ntrail; my eyes see only two sets of prints. Garrow could not have been taken \\nfrom here.\\nHe focused on \\nthe trampled snow. The faint imprints of two pairs of leather boots headed \\ntoward the house. On top of those were traces of the same two sets of boots \\nleaving. And whoever had made the departing tracks had been carrying the same \\nweight as when they arrived.You’re right, Garrow has to be here! He \\nleapt to his feet and hurried back to the house.\\nI will search \\naround the buildings and in the forest,said Saphira.\\nEragon scrambled \\ninto the remains of the kitchen and frantically started digging through a pile \\nof rubble. Pieces of debris that he could not have moved normally now seemed to \\nshift on their own accord. A cupboard, mostly intact, stymied him for a second, \\nthen he heaved and sent it flying. As he pulled on a board, something rattled \\nbehind him. He spun around, ready for an attack.\\nA hand extended \\nfrom under a section of collapsed roof. It moved weakly, and he grasped it with \\na cry. “Uncle, can you hear me?” There was no response. Eragon tore at pieces \\nof wood, heedless of the splinters that pierced his hands. He quickly exposed \\nan arm and shoulder, but was barred by a heavy beam. He threw his shoulder at \\nit and shoved with every fiber of his being, but it defied his efforts. \\n“Saphira! I need you!”\\nShe came \\nimmediately. Wood cracked under her feet as she crawled over the ruined walls. \\nWithout a word she nosed past him and set her side against the beam. Her claws \\nsank into what was left of the floor; her muscles strained. With a grating \\nsound, the beam lifted, and Eragon rushed under it. Garrow lay on his stomach, \\nhis clothes mostly torn off. Eragon pulled him out of the rubble. As soon as \\nthey were clear, Saphira released the beam, leaving it to crash to the floor.\\nEragon dragged \\nGarrow out of the destroyed house and eased him to the ground. Dismayed, he \\ntouched his uncle gently. His skin was gray, lifeless, and dry, as if a fever \\nhad burned off any sweat. His lip was split, and there was a long scrape on his \\ncheekbone, but that was not the worst. Deep, ragged burns covered most of his \\nbody. They were chalky white and oozed clear liquid. A cloying, sickening smell \\nhung over him—the odor of rotting fruit. His breath came in short jerks, each \\none sounding like a death rattle.\\nMurderers,hissed Saphira.\\nDon’t say that. \\nHe can still be saved! We have to get him to Gertrude. I can’t carry him to \\nCarvahall, though.\\n\\nSaphira \\npresented an image of Garrow hanging under her while she flew.\\nCan you lift \\nboth of us?\\n\\nI must. \\nEragon dug \\nthrough the rubble until he found a board and leather thongs. He had Saphira pierce \\na hole with a claw at each of the board’s corners, then he looped a piece of \\nleather through each hole and tied them to her forelegs. After checking to make \\nsure the knots were secure, he rolled Garrow onto the board and lashed him \\ndown. As he did, a scrap of black cloth fell from his uncle’s hand. It matched \\nthe strangers’ clothing. He angrily stuffed it in a pocket, mounted Saphira, \\nand closed his eyes as his body settled into a steady throb of pain.Now!\\nShe leapt up, \\nhind legs digging into the ground. Her wings clawed at the air as she slowly \\nclimbed. Tendons strained and popped as she battled gravity. For a long, \\npainful second, nothing happened, but then she lunged forward powerfully and \\nthey rose higher. Once they were over the forest, Eragon told her,Follow the \\nroad. It’ll give you enough room if you have to land.\\nI might be seen. \\nIt doesn’t \\nmatter anymore!She \\nargued no further as she veered to the road and headed for Carvahall. Garrow \\nswung wildly underneath them; only the slender leather cords kept him from \\nfalling.\\nThe extra weight \\nslowed Saphira. Before long her head sagged, and there was froth at her mouth. \\nShe struggled to continue, yet they were almost a league from Carvahall when \\nshe locked her wings and sank toward the road.\\nHer hind feet \\ntouched with a shower of snow. Eragon tumbled off her, landing heavily on his \\nside to avoid hurting his legs. He struggled to his feet and worked to untie \\nthe leather from Saphira’s legs. Her thick panting filled the air.Find a \\nsafe place to rest, he said.I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, so \\nyou’re going to have to take care of yourself for a while.\\nI will wait,she said.\\nHe gritted his \\nteeth and began to drag Garrow down the road. The first few steps sent an \\nexplosion of agony through him. “I can’t do this!” he howled at the sky, then \\ntook a few more steps. His mouth locked into a snarl. He stared at the ground \\nbetween his feet as he forced himself to hold a steady pace. It was a fight \\nagainst his unruly body—a fight he refused to lose. The minutes crawled by at \\nan excruciating rate. Each yard he covered seemed many times that. With \\ndesperation he wondered if Carvahall still existed or if the strangers had \\nburnt it down, too. After a time, through a haze of pain, he heard shouting and \\nlooked up.\\nBrom was running \\ntoward him—eyes large, hair awry, and one side of his head caked with dried \\nblood. He waved his arms wildly before dropping his staff and grabbing Eragon’s \\nshoulders, saying something in a loud voice. Eragon blinked uncomprehendingly. \\nWithout warning, the ground rushed up to meet him. He tasted blood, then \\nblacked out.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 18': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD EATHWATCH \\nDreams roiled in \\nEragon’s mind, breeding and living by their own laws.He watched as a group \\nof people on proud horses approached a lonely river. Many had silver hair and \\ncarried tall lances. A strange, fair ship waited for them, shining under a \\nbright moon. The figures slowly boarded the vessel; two of them, taller than \\nthe rest, walked arm in arm. Their faces were obscured by cowls, but he could \\ntell that one was a woman. They stood on the deck of the ship and faced the \\nshore. A man stood alone on the pebble beach, the only one who had not boarded \\nthe ship. He threw back his head and let out a long, aching cry. As it faded, \\nthe ship glided down the river, without a breeze or oars, out into the flat, \\nempty land. The vision clouded, but just before it disappeared, Eragon glimpsed \\ntwo dragons in the sky.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon was first \\naware of the creaking: back and forth, back and forth. The persistent sound \\nmade him open his eyes and stare at the underside of a thatched roof. A rough \\nblanket was draped over him, concealing his nakedness. Someone had bandaged his \\nlegs and tied a clean rag around his knuckles.\\nHe was in a \\nsingle-room hut. A mortar and pestle sat on a table with bowls and plants. Rows \\nof dried herbs hung from the walls and suffused the air with strong, earthy \\naromas. Flames writhed inside a fireplace, before which sat a rotund woman in a \\nwicker rocking chair—the town healer, Gertrude. Her head lolled, eyes closed. A \\npair of knitting needles and a ball of wool thread rested in her lap.\\nThough Eragon \\nfelt drained of willpower, he made himself sit up. That helped to clear his \\nmind. He sifted through his memories of the last two days. His first thought \\nwas of Garrow, and his second was of Saphira.I hope she’s in a safe place. \\nHe tried to contact her but could not. Wherever she was, it was far from \\nCarvahall.At least Brom got me to Carvahall. I wonder what happened to him? There \\nwas all that blood.\\nGertrude stirred \\nand opened her sparkling eyes. “Oh,” she said. “You’re awake. Good!” Her voice \\nwas rich and warm. “How do you feel?”\\n“Well enough. \\nWhere’s Garrow?”\\nGertrude dragged \\nthe chair close to the bed. “Over at Horst’s. There wasn’t enough room to keep \\nboth of you here. And let me tell you, it’s kept me on my toes, having to run \\nback and forth, checking to see if the two of you were all right.”\\nEragon swallowed \\nhis worries and asked, “How is he?”\\nThere was a long \\ndelay as she examined her hands. “Not good. He has a fever that refuses to \\nbreak, and his injuries aren’t healing.”\\n“I have to see \\nhim.” He tried to get up.\\n“Not until you \\neat,” she said sharply, pushing him down. “I didn’t spend all this time sitting \\nby your side so you can get back up and hurt yourself. Half the skin on your \\nlegs was torn off, and your fever broke only last night. Don’t worry yourself \\nabout Garrow. He’ll be fine. He’s a tough man.” Gertrude hung a kettle over the \\nfire, then began chopping parsnips for soup.\\n“How long have I \\nbeen here?”\\n“Two full days.”\\nTwo days!That meant his \\nlast meal had been four mornings ago! Just thinking about it made Eragon feel \\nweak.Saphira’s been on her own this entire time; I hope she’s all right.\\n“The whole town \\nwants to know what happened. They sent men down to your farm and found it \\ndestroyed.” Eragon nodded; he had expected that. “Your barn was burned down. . \\n. . Is that how Garrow was injured?”\\n“I . . . I don’t \\nknow,” said Eragon. “I wasn’t there when it happened.”\\n“Well, no \\nmatter. I’m sure it’ll all get untangled.” Gertrude resumed knitting while the \\nsoup cooked. “That’s quite a scar on your palm.”\\nHe reflexively \\nclenched his hand. “Yes.”\\n“How did you get \\nit?”\\nSeveral possible \\nanswers came to mind. He chose the simplest one. “I’ve had it ever since I can \\nremember. I never asked Garrow where it came from.”\\n“Mmm.” The \\nsilence remained unbroken until the soup reached a rolling boil. Gertrude \\npoured it in a bowl and handed it to Eragon with a spoon. He accepted it \\ngratefully and took a cautious sip. It was delicious.\\nWhen he \\nfinished, he asked, “Can I visit Garrow now?”\\nGertrude sighed. \\n“You’re a determined one, aren’t you? Well, if you really want to, I won’t stop \\nyou. Put on your clothes and we’ll go.”\\nShe turned her \\nback as he struggled into his pants, wincing as they dragged over the bandages, \\nand then slipped on his shirt. Gertrude helped him stand. His legs were weak, \\nbut they did not pain him like before.\\n“Take a few \\nsteps,” she commanded, then dryly observed, “At least you won’t have to crawl \\nthere.”\\nOutside, a \\nblustery wind blew smoke from the adjacent buildings into their faces. Storm \\nclouds hid the Spine and covered the valley while a curtain of snow advanced \\ntoward the village, obscuring the foothills. Eragon leaned heavily on Gertrude \\nas they made their way through Carvahall.\\nHorst had built \\nhis two-story house on a hill so he could enjoy a view of the mountains. He had \\nlavished all of his skill on it. The shale roof shadowed a railed balcony that \\nextended from a tall window on the second floor. Each water spout was a \\nsnarling gargoyle, and every window and door was framed by carvings of \\nserpents, harts, ravens, and knotted vines.\\nThe door was \\nopened by Elain, Horst’s wife, a small, willowy woman with refined features and \\nsilky blond hair pinned into a bun. Her dress was demure and neat, and her \\nmovements graceful. “Please, come in,” she said softly. They stepped over the \\nthreshold into a large well-lit room. A staircase with a polished balustrade curved \\ndown to the floor. The walls were the color of honey. Elain gave Eragon a sad \\nsmile, but addressed Gertrude. “I was just about to send for you. He isn’t \\ndoing well. You should see him right away.”\\n“Elain, you’ll \\nhave to help Eragon up the stairs,” Gertrude said, then hurried up them two at \\na time.\\n“It’s okay, I \\ncan do it myself.”\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Elain. He nodded, but she looked doubtful. “Well . . . as soon as you’re \\ndone come visit me in the kitchen. I have a fresh-baked pie you might enjoy.” \\nAs soon as she left, he sagged against the wall, welcoming the support. Then he \\nstarted up the stairs, one painful step at a time. When he reached the top, he \\nlooked down a long hallway dotted with doors. The last one was open slightly. \\nTaking a breath, he lurched toward it.\\nKatrina stood by \\na fireplace, boiling rags. She looked up, murmured a condolence, and then \\nreturned to her work. Gertrude stood beside her, grinding herbs for a poultice. \\nA bucket by her feet held snow melting into ice water.\\nGarrow lay on a \\nbed piled high with blankets. Sweat covered his brow, and his eyeballs \\nflickered blindly under their lids. The skin on his face was shrunken like a \\ncadaver’s. He was still, save for subtle tremors from his shallow breathing. \\nEragon touched his uncle’s forehead with a feeling of unreality. It burned \\nagainst his hand. He apprehensively lifted the edge of the blankets and saw \\nthat Garrow’s many wounds were bound with strips of cloth. Where the bandages \\nwere being changed, the burns were exposed to the air. They had not begun to \\nheal. Eragon looked at Gertrude with hopeless eyes. “Can’t you do anything \\nabout these?”\\nShe pressed a \\nrag into the bucket of ice water, then draped the cool cloth over Garrow’s \\nhead. “I’ve tried everything: salves, poultices, tinctures, but nothing works. \\nIf the wounds closed, he would have a better chance. Still, things may turn for \\nthe better. He’s hardy and strong.”\\nEragon moved to \\na corner and sank to the floor.This isn’t the way things are supposed to be! \\nSilence swallowed his thoughts. He stared blankly at the bed. After a while he \\nnoticed Katrina kneeling beside him. She put an arm around him. When he did not \\nrespond, she diffidently left.\\nSometime later \\nthe door opened and Horst came in. He talked to Gertrude in a low voice, then \\napproached Eragon. “Come on. You need to get out of here.” Before Eragon could \\nprotest, Horst dragged him to his feet and shepherded him out the door.\\n“I want to \\nstay,” he complained.\\n“You need a \\nbreak and fresh air. Don’t worry, you can go back soon enough,” consoled Horst.\\nEragon \\ngrudgingly let the smith help him downstairs into the kitchen. Heady smells \\nfrom half a dozen dishes—rich with spices and herbs—filled the air. Albriech \\nand Baldor were there, talking with their mother as she kneaded bread. The \\nbrothers fell silent as they saw Eragon, but he had heard enough to know that \\nthey were discussing Garrow.\\n“Here, sit \\ndown,” said Horst, offering a chair.\\nEragon sank into \\nit gratefully. “Thank you.” His hands were shaking slightly, so he clasped them \\nin his lap. A plate, piled high with food, was set before him.\\n“You don’t have \\nto eat,” said Elain, “but it’s there if you want.” She returned to her cooking \\nas he picked up a fork. He could barely swallow a few bites.\\n“How do you \\nfeel?” asked Horst.\\n“Terrible.”\\nThe smith waited \\na moment. “I know this isn’t the best time, but we need to know . . . what \\nhappened?”\\n“I don’t really \\nremember.”\\n“Eragon,” said \\nHorst, leaning forward, “I was one of the people who went out to your farm. \\nYour house didn’t just fall apart—something tore it to pieces. Surrounding it \\nwere tracks of a gigantic beast I’ve never seen nor heard of before. Others saw \\nthem too. Now, if there’s a Shade or a monster roaming around, we have to know. \\nYou’re the only one who can tell us.”\\nEragon knew he \\nhad to lie. “When I left Carvahall . . . ,” he counted up the time, “four days \\nago, there were . . . strangers in town asking about a stone like the one I \\nfound.” He gestured at Horst. “You talked to me about them, and because of \\nthat, I hurried home.” All eyes were upon him. He licked his lips. “Nothing . . \\n. nothing happened that night. The next morning I finished my chores and went \\nwalking in the forest. Before long I heard an explosion and saw smoke above the \\ntrees. I rushed back as fast as I could, but whoever did it was already gone. I \\ndug through the wreckage and . . . found Garrow.”\\n“So then you put \\nhim on the plank and dragged him back?” asked Albriech.\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, “but before I left, I looked at the path to the road. There were two \\npairs of tracks on it, both of them men’s.” He dug in his pocket and pulled out \\nthe scrap of black fabric. “This was clenched in Garrow’s hand. I think it \\nmatches what those strangers were wearing.” He set it on the table.\\n“It does,” said \\nHorst. He looked both thoughtful and angry. “And what of your legs? How were \\nthey injured?”\\n“I’m not sure,” \\nsaid Eragon, shaking his head. “I think it happened when I dug Garrow out, but \\nI don’t know. It wasn’t until the blood started dripping down my legs that I \\nnoticed it.”\\n“That’s \\nhorrible!” exclaimed Elain.\\n“We should \\npursue those men,” stated Albriech hotly. “They can’t get away with this! With \\na pair of horses we could catch them tomorrow and bring them back here.”\\n“Put that \\nfoolishness out of your head,” said Horst. “They could probably pick you up \\nlike a baby and throw you in a tree. Remember what happened to the house? We \\ndon’t want to get in the way of those people. Besides, they have what they want \\nnow.” He looked at Eragon. “They did take the stone, didn’t they?”\\n“It wasn’t in \\nthe house.”\\n“Then there’s no \\nreason for them to return now that they have it.” He gave Eragon a piercing \\nlook. “You didn’t mention anything about those strange tracks. Do you know \\nwhere they came from?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “I didn’t see them.”\\nBaldor abruptly \\nspoke. “I don’t like this. Too much of this rings of wizardry. Who are those \\nmen? Are they Shades? Why did they want the stone, and how could they have \\ndestroyed the house except with dark powers? You may be right, Father, the \\nstone might be all they wanted, but I think we will see them again.”\\nSilence followed \\nhis words.\\nSomething had \\nbeen overlooked, though Eragon was not sure what. Then it struck him. With a \\nsinking heart, he voiced his suspicion. “Roran doesn’t know, does he?”How \\ncould I have forgotten him?\\nHorst shook his \\nhead. “He and Dempton left a little while after you. Unless they ran into some \\ndifficulty on the road, they’ve been in Therinsford for a couple of days now. \\nWe were going to send a message, but the weather was too cold yesterday and the \\nday before.”\\n“Baldor and I \\nwere about to leave when you woke up,” offered Albriech.\\nHorst ran a hand \\nthrough his beard. “Go on, both of you. I’ll help you saddle the horses.”\\nBaldor turned to \\nEragon. “I’ll break it to him gently,” he promised, then followed Horst and \\nAlbriech out of the kitchen.\\nEragon remained \\nat the table, his eyes focused on a knot in the wood. Every excruciating detail \\nwas clear to him: the twisting grain, an asymmetrical bump, three little ridges \\nwith a fleck of color. The knot was filled with endless detail; the closer he \\nlooked, the more he saw. He searched for answers in it, but if there were any, \\nthey eluded him.\\nA faint call \\nbroke through his pounding thoughts. It sounded like yelling from outside. He \\nignored it.Let someone else deal with it. Several minutes later he heard \\nit again, louder than before. Angrily, he blocked it out.Why can’t they be \\nquiet? Garrow’s resting. He glanced at Elain, but she did not seem to be \\nbothered by the noise.\\nERAGON!The roar was so \\nstrong he almost fell out of the chair. He peered around in alarm, but nothing \\nhad changed. He suddenly realized that the shouts had been inside his head.\\nSaphira?he asked \\nanxiously.\\nThere was a \\npause.Yes, stone ears.\\nRelief seeped \\ninto him.Where are you?\\nShe sent him an \\nimage of a small clump of trees.I tried to contact you many times, but you \\nwere beyond reach.\\nI was sick . . . \\nbut I’m better now. Why couldn’t I sense you earlier? \\nAfter two nights \\nof waiting, hunger bested me. I had to hunt. \\nDid you catch \\nanything?\\n\\nA young buck. He \\nwas wise enough to guard against the predators of land, but not those of sky. \\nWhen I first caught him in my jaws, he kicked vigorously and tried to escape. I \\nwas stronger, though, and when defeat became unavoidable, he gave up and died. \\nDoes Garrow also fight the inevitable? \\nI don’t know.He told her the \\nparticulars, then said,It’ll be a long time, if ever, before we can go home. \\nI won’t be able to see you for at least a couple of days. You might as well \\nmake yourself comfortable.\\nUnhappily, she \\nsaid,I will do as you say. But do not take too long.\\nThey parted \\nreluctantly. He looked out a window and was surprised to see that the sun had \\nset. Feeling very tired, he limped to Elain, who was wrapping meat pies with \\noilcloth. “I’m going back to Gertrude’s house to sleep,” he said.\\nShe finished \\nwith the packages and asked, “Why don’t you stay with us? You’ll be closer to \\nyour uncle, and Gertrude can have her bed back.”\\n“Do you have \\nenough room?” he asked, wavering.\\n“Of course.” She \\nwiped her hands. “Come with me; I’ll get everything ready.” She escorted him \\nupstairs to an empty room. He sat on the edge of the bed. “Do you need anything \\nelse?” she asked. He shook his head. “In that case, I’ll be downstairs. Call me \\nif you need help.” He listened as she descended the stairs. Then he opened the \\ndoor and slipped down the hallway to Garrow’s room. Gertrude gave him a small \\nsmile over her darting knitting needles.\\n“How is he?” whispered \\nEragon.\\nHer voice rasped \\nwith fatigue. “He’s weak, but the fever’s gone down a little and some of the \\nburns look better. We’ll have to wait and see, but this could mean he’ll \\nrecover.”\\nThat lightened \\nEragon’s mood, and he returned to his room. The darkness seemed unfriendly as \\nhe huddled under the blankets. Eventually he fell asleep, healing the wounds \\nhis body and soul had suffered.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 19': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEMADNESS OFLIFE\\nIt was dark when \\nEragon jolted upright in bed, breathing hard. The room was chilly; goose bumps \\nformed on his arms and shoulders. It was a few hours before dawn—the time when \\nnothing moves and life waits for the first warm touches of sunlight.\\nHis heart \\npounded as a terrible premonition gripped him. It felt like a shroud lay over \\nthe world, and its darkest corner was over his room. He quietly got out of bed \\nand dressed. With apprehension he hurried down the hallway. Alarm shot through \\nhim when he saw the door to Garrow’s room open and people clustered inside.\\nGarrow lay \\npeacefully on the bed. He was dressed in clean clothes, his hair had been \\ncombed back, and his face was calm. He might have been sleeping if not for the \\nsilver amulet clasped around his neck and the sprig of dried hemlock on his \\nchest, the last gifts from the living to the dead.\\nKatrina stood \\nnext to the bed, face pale and eyes downcast. He heard her whisper, “I had \\nhoped to call himFather one day. . . .”\\nCall him Father,he thought \\nbitterly,a right even I don’t have. He felt like a ghost, drained of all \\nvitality. Everything was insubstantial except for Garrow’s face. Tears flooded \\nEragon’s cheeks. He stood there, shoulders shaking, but did not cry out. \\nMother, aunt, uncle—he had lost them all. The weight of his grief was crushing, \\na monstrous force that left him tottering. Someone led him back to his room, \\nuttering consolations.\\nHe fell on the \\nbed, wrapped his arms around his head, and sobbed convulsively. He felt Saphira \\ncontact him, but he pushed her aside and let himself be swept away by sorrow. \\nHe could not accept that Garrow was gone. If he did, what was left to believe \\nin? Only a merciless, uncaring world that snuffed lives like candles before a \\nwind. Frustrated and terrified, he turned his tear-dampened face toward the \\nheavens and shouted, “What god would do this? Show yourself!” He heard people \\nrunning to his room, but no answer came from above. “He didn’t deserve this!”\\nComforting hands \\ntouched him, and he was aware of Elain sitting next to him. She held him as he \\ncried, and eventually, exhausted, he slipped unwillingly into sleep.\\nAR IDER’SBLADE\\nAnguish enveloped \\nEragon as he awoke. Though he kept his eyes closed, they could not stop a fresh \\nflow of tears. He searched for some idea or hope to help him keep his sanity.I \\ncan’t live with this, he moaned.\\nThen don’t.Saphira’s words \\nreverberated in his head.\\nHow? Garrow is \\ngone forever! And in time, I must meet the same fate. Love, family, \\naccomplishments—they are all torn away, leaving nothing. What is the worth of \\nanything we do?\\n\\nThe worth is in \\nthe act. Your worth halts when you surrender the will to change and experience \\nlife. But options are before you; choose one and dedicate yourself to it. The \\ndeeds will give you new hope and purpose. \\nBut what can I \\ndo?\\n\\nThe only true \\nguide is your heart. Nothing less than its supreme desire can help you. \\nShe left him to \\nponder her statements. Eragon examined his emotions. It surprised him that, \\nmore than grief, he found a searing anger.What do you want me to do . . . \\npursue the strangers?\\nYes. \\nHer frank answer \\nconfused him. He took a deep, trembling breath.Why?\\nRemember what \\nyou said in the Spine? How you reminded me of my duty as dragon, and I returned \\nwith you despite the urging of my instinct? So, too, must you control yourself. \\nI thought long and deep the past few days, and I realized what it means to be \\ndragon and Rider: It is our destiny to attempt the impossible, to accomplish \\ngreat deeds regardless of fear. It is our responsibility to the future. \\nI don’t care \\nwhat you say; those aren’t reasons to leave!cried Eragon.\\nThen here are \\nothers. My tracks have been seen, and people are alert to my presence. \\nEventually I will be exposed. Besides, there is nothing here for you. No farm, \\nno family, and—\\n\\nRoran’s not \\ndead!he \\nsaid vehemently.\\nBut if you stay, \\nyou’ll have to explain what really happened. He has a right to know how and why \\nhis father died. What might he do once he knows of me? \\nSaphira’s \\narguments whirled around in Eragon’s head, but he shrank from the idea of \\nforsaking Palancar Valley; it was his home. Yet the thought of enacting \\nvengeance on the strangers was fiercely comforting.Am I strong enough for \\nthis?\\nYou have me. \\nDoubt besieged \\nhim. It would be such a wild, desperate thing to do. Contempt for his \\nindecision rose, and a harsh smile danced on his lips. Saphira was right. \\nNothing mattered anymore except the act itself.The doing is the thing. \\nAnd what would give him more satisfaction than hunting down the strangers? A \\nterrible energy and strength began to grow in him. It grabbed his emotions and \\nforged them into a solid bar of anger with one word stamped on it: revenge. His \\nhead pounded as he said with conviction,I will do it.\\nHe severed the \\ncontact with Saphira and rolled out of bed, his body tense like a coiled \\nspring. It was still early morning; he had only slept a few hours.Nothing is \\nmore dangerous than an enemy with nothing to lose, he thought.Which is \\nwhat I have become.\\nYesterday he had \\nhad difficulty walking upright, but now he moved confidently, held in place by \\nhis iron will. The pain his body sent him was defied and ignored.\\nAs he crept out \\nof the house, he heard the murmur of two people talking. Curious, he stopped \\nand listened. Elain was saying in her gentle voice, “. . . place to stay. We \\nhave room.” Horst answered inaudibly in his bass rumble. “Yes, the poor boy,” \\nreplied Elain.\\nThis time Eragon \\ncould hear Horst’s response. “Maybe . . .” There was a long pause. “I’ve been \\nthinking about what Eragon said, and I’m not sure he told us everything.”\\n“What do you \\nmean?” asked Elain. There was concern in her voice.\\n“When we started \\nfor their farm, the road was scraped smooth by the board he dragged Garrow on. \\nThen we reached a place where the snow was all trampled and churned up. His \\nfootprints and signs of the board stopped there, but we also saw the same giant \\ntracks from the farm. And what about his legs? I can’t believe he didn’t notice \\nlosing that much skin. I didn’t want to push him for answers earlier, but now I \\nthink I will.”\\n“Maybe what he \\nsaw scared him so much that he doesn’t want to talk about it,” suggested Elain. \\n“You saw how distraught he was.”\\n“That still \\ndoesn’t explain how he managed to get Garrow nearly all the way here without \\nleaving any tracks.”\\nSaphira was \\nright,thought \\nEragon.It’s time to leave.Too many questions from too many people.Sooner or \\nlater they’ll find the answers. He continued through the house, tensing \\nwhenever the floor creaked.\\nThe streets were \\nclear; few people were up at this time of day. He stopped for a minute and \\nforced himself to focus.I don’t need a horse. Saphira will be my steed, but \\nshe needs a saddle. She can hunt for both of us, so I don’t have to worry about \\nfood—though I should get some anyway. Whatever else I need I can find buried in \\nour house.\\nHe went to \\nGedric’s tanning vats on the outskirts of Carvahall. The vile smell made him \\ncringe, but he kept moving, heading for a shack set into the side of a hill \\nwhere the cured hides were stored. He cut down three large ox hides from the \\nrows of skins hanging from the ceiling. The thievery made him feel guilty, but \\nhe reasoned,It’s not really stealing. I’ll pay Gedric back someday, along \\nwith Horst. He rolled up the thick leather and took it to a stand of trees \\naway from the village. He wedged the hides between the branches of a tree, then \\nreturned to Carvahall.\\nNow for food.He went to the \\ntavern, intending to get it there, but then smiled tightly and reversed \\ndirection. If he was going to steal, it might as well be from Sloan. He sneaked \\nup to the butcher’s house. The front door was barred whenever Sloan was not \\nthere, but the side door was secured with only a thin chain, which he broke \\neasily. The rooms inside were dark. He fumbled blindly until his hands came \\nupon hard piles of meat wrapped in cloth. He stuffed as many of them as he \\ncould under his shirt, then hurried back to the street and furtively closed the \\ndoor.\\nA woman shouted \\nhis name nearby. He clasped the bottom of his shirt to keep the meat from \\nfalling out and ducked behind a corner. He shivered as Horst walked between two \\nhouses not ten feet away.\\nEragon ran as \\nsoon as Horst was out of sight. His legs burned as he pounded down an alley and \\nback to the trees. He slipped between the tree trunks, then turned to see if he \\nwas being pursued. No one was there. Relieved, he let out his breath and \\nreached into the tree for the leather. It was gone.\\n“Going \\nsomewhere?”\\nEragon whirled \\naround. Brom scowled angrily at him, an ugly wound on the side of his head. A \\nshort sword hung at his belt in a brown sheath. The hides were in his hands.\\nEragon’s eyes \\nnarrowed in irritation. How had the old man managed to sneak up on him? \\nEverything had been so quiet, he would have sworn that no one was around. “Give \\nthem back,” he snapped.\\n“Why? So you can \\nrun off before Garrow is even buried?” The accusation was sharp.\\n“It’s none of \\nyour business!” he barked, temper flashing. “Why did you follow me?”\\n“I didn’t,” \\ngrunted Brom. “I’ve been waiting for you here. Now where are you going?”\\n“Nowhere.” \\nEragon lunged for the skins and grabbed them from Brom’s hands. Brom did \\nnothing to stop him.\\n“I hope you have \\nenough meat to feed your dragon.”\\nEragon froze. \\n“What are you talking about?”\\nBrom crossed his \\narms. “Don’t fool with me. I know where that mark on your hand, the gedwëy \\nignasia, theshining palm, comes from: you have touched a dragon hatchling. \\nI know why you came to me with those questions, and I know that once more the \\nRiders live.”\\nEragon dropped \\nthe leather and meat.It’s finally happened . . . I have to get away! I can’t \\nrun faster than him with my injured legs, but if . . . Saphira! he called.\\nFor a few \\nagonizing seconds she did not answer, but then,Yes.\\nWe’ve been \\ndiscovered! I need you!He sent her a picture of where he was, and she took \\noff immediately. Now he just had to stall Brom. “How did you find out?” he \\nasked in a hollow voice.\\nBrom stared into \\nthe distance and moved his lips soundlessly as if he were talking to someone \\nelse. Then he said, “There were clues and hints everywhere; I had only to pay \\nattention. Anyone with the right knowledge could have done the same. Tell me, \\nhow is your dragon?”\\n“She,” said \\nEragon, “is fine. We weren’t at the farm when the strangers came.”\\n“Ah, your legs. \\nYou were flying?”\\nHow did Brom \\nfigure that out? What if the strangers coerced him into doing this? Maybe they \\nwant him to discover where I’m going so they can ambush us. And where is \\nSaphira?He \\nreached out with his mind and found her circling far overhead.Come!\\nNo, I will watch \\nfor a time.\\n\\nWhy! \\nBecause of the \\nslaughter at Dorú Areaba. \\nWhat? \\nBrom leaned \\nagainst a tree with a slight smile. “I have talked with her, and she has agreed \\nto stay above us until we settle our differences. As you can see, you really \\ndon’t have any choice but to answer my questions. Now tell me, where are you \\ngoing?”\\nBewildered, \\nEragon put a hand to his temple.How could Brom speak to Saphira? The \\nback of his head throbbed and ideas whirled through his mind, but he kept \\nreaching the same conclusion: he had to tell the old man something. He said, “I \\nwas going to find a safe place to stay while I heal.”\\n“And after \\nthat?”\\nThe question \\ncould not be ignored. The throbbing in his head grew worse. It was impossible \\nto think; nothing seemed clear anymore. All he wanted to do was tell someone \\nabout the events of the past few months. It tore at him that his secret had \\ncaused Garrow’s death. He gave up and said tremulously, “I was going to hunt \\ndown the strangers and kill them.”\\n“A mighty task \\nfor one so young,” Brom said in a normal tone, as if Eragon had proposed the \\nmost obvious and suitable thing to do. “Certainly a worthy endeavor and one you \\nare fit to carry out, yet it strikes me that help would not be unwelcome.” He \\nreached behind a bush and pulled out a large pack. His tone became gruff. \\n“Anyway, I’m not going to stay behind while some stripling gets to run around \\nwith a dragon.”\\nIs he really \\noffering help, or is it a trap?Eragon was afraid of what his mysterious \\nenemies could do.But Brom convinced Saphira to trust him, and they’ve talked \\nthrough the mind touch.If she isn’t worried . . . He decided to put his \\nsuspicions aside for the present. “I don’t need help,” said Eragon, then \\ngrudgingly added, “but you can come.”\\n“Then we had \\nbest be going,” said Brom. His face blanked for a moment. “I think you’ll find \\nthat your dragon will listen to you again.”\\nSaphira?asked Eragon.\\nYes. \\nHe resisted the \\nurge to question her.Will you meet us at the farm?\\nYes. So you \\nreached an agreement?\\n\\nI guess so.She broke \\ncontact and soared away. He glanced at Carvahall and saw people running from \\nhouse to house. “I think they’re looking for me.”\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “Probably. Shall we go?”\\nEragon \\nhesitated. “I’d like to leave a message for Roran. It doesn’t seem right to run \\noff without telling him why.”\\n“It’s been taken \\ncare of,” assured Brom. “I left a letter for him with Gertrude, explaining a \\nfew things. I also cautioned him to be on guard for certain dangers. Is that \\nsatisfactory?”\\nEragon nodded. \\nHe wrapped the leather around the meat and started off. They were careful to \\nstay out of sight until they reached the road, then quickened their pace, eager \\nto distance themselves from Carvahall. Eragon plowed ahead determinedly, his \\nlegs burning. The mindless rhythm of walking freed his mind to think.Once we \\nget home, I won’t travel any farther with Brom until I get some answers, he \\ntold himself firmly. I hope that he can tell me more about the Riders and \\nwhom I’m fighting.\\nAs the wreckage \\nof the farm came into view, Brom’s eyebrows beetled with anger. Eragon was \\ndismayed to see how swiftly nature was reclaiming the farm. Snow and dirt were \\nalready piled inside the house, concealing the violence of the strangers’ \\nattack. All that remained of the barn was a rapidly eroding rectangle of soot.\\nBrom’s head \\nsnapped up as the sound of Saphira’s wings drifted over the trees. She dived \\npast them from behind, almost brushing their heads. They staggered as a wall of \\nair buffeted them. Saphira’s scales glittered as she wheeled over the farm and \\nlanded gracefully.\\nBrom stepped \\nforward with an expression both solemn and joyous. His eyes were shining, and a \\ntear shone on his cheek before it disappeared into his beard. He stood there \\nfor a long while, breathing heavily as he watched Saphira, and she him. Eragon \\nheard him muttering and edged closer to listen.\\n“So . . . it \\nstarts again. But how and where will it end? My sight is veiled; I cannot tell \\nif this be tragedy or farce, for the elements of both are here. . . . However \\nit may be, my station is unchanged, and I . . .”\\nWhatever else he \\nmight have said faded away as Saphira proudly approached them. Eragon passed \\nBrom, pretended he had heard nothing, and greeted her. There was something \\ndifferent between them now, as if they knew each other even more intimately, yet \\nwere still strangers. He rubbed her neck, and his palm tingled as their minds \\ntouched. A strong curiosity came from her.\\nI’ve seen no \\nhumans except you and Garrow, and he was badly injured,she said.\\nYou’ve viewed \\npeople through my eyes.\\nIt’s not the \\nsame.She \\ncame closer and turned her long head so that she could inspect Brom with one \\nlarge blue eye.You really are queer creatures, she said critically, and \\ncontinued to stare at him. Brom held still as she sniffed the air, and then he \\nextended a hand to her. Saphira slowly bowed her head and allowed him to touch \\nher on the brow. With a snort, she jerked back and retreated behind Eragon. Her \\ntail flicked over the ground.\\nWhat is it?he asked. She \\ndid not answer.\\nBrom turned to \\nhim and asked in an undertone, “What’s her name?”\\n“Saphira.” A \\npeculiar expression crossed Brom’s face. He ground the butt of his staff into \\nthe earth with such force his knuckles turned white. “Of all the names you gave \\nme, it was the only one she liked. I think it fits,” Eragon added quickly.\\n“Fit it does,” \\nsaid Brom. There was something in his voice Eragon could not identify. Was it \\nloss, wonder, fear, envy? He was not sure; it could have been none of them or \\nall. Brom raised his voice and said, “Greetings, Saphira. I am honored to meet \\nyou.” He twisted his hand in a strange gesture and bowed.\\nI like him,said Saphira \\nquietly.\\nOf course you \\ndo; everyone enjoys flattery.Eragon touched her on the shoulder and \\nwent to the ruined house. Saphira trailed behind with Brom. The old man looked \\nvibrant and alive.\\nEragon climbed \\ninto the house and crawled under a door into what was left of his room. He \\nbarely recognized it under the piles of shattered wood. Guided by memory, he \\nsearched where the inside wall had been and found his empty pack. Part of the \\nframe was broken, but the damage could be easily repaired. He kept rummaging \\nand eventually uncovered the end of his bow, which was still in its buckskin \\ntube.\\nThough the \\nleather was scratched and scuffed, he was pleased to see that the oiled wood \\nwas unharmed.Finally, some luck. He strung the bow and pulled on the \\nsinew experimentally. It bent smoothly, without any snaps or creaks. Satisfied, \\nhe hunted for his quiver, which he found buried nearby. Many of the arrows were \\nbroken.\\nHe unstrung the \\nbow and handed it and the quiver to Brom, who said, “It takes a strong arm to \\npull that.” Eragon took the compliment silently. He picked through the rest of \\nthe house for other useful items and dumped the collection next to Brom. It was \\na meager pile. “What now?” asked Brom. His eyes were sharp and inquisitive. \\nEragon looked away.\\n“We find a place \\nto hide.”\\n“Do you have \\nsomewhere in mind?”\\n“Yes.” He \\nwrapped all the supplies, except for his bow, into a tight bundle and tied it \\nshut. Hefting it onto his back, he said, “This way,” and headed into the \\nforest.Saphira, follow us in the air. Your footprints are too easily found \\nand tracked.\\nVery well.She took off \\nbehind them.\\nTheir \\ndestination was nearby, but Eragon took a circuitous route in an effort to \\nbaffle any pursuers. It was well over an hour before he finally stopped in a \\nwell-concealed bramble.\\nThe irregular \\nclearing in the center was just large enough for a fire, two people, and a \\ndragon. Red squirrels scampered into the trees, chattering in protest at their \\nintrusion. Brom extricated himself from a vine and looked around with interest. \\n“Does anyone else know of this?” he asked.\\n“No. I found it \\nwhen we first moved here. It took me a week to dig into the center, and another \\nweek to clear out all the deadwood.” Saphira landed beside them and folded her \\nwings, careful to avoid the thorns. She curled up, snapping twigs with her hard \\nscales, and rested her head on the ground. Her unreadable eyes followed them \\nclosely.\\nBrom leaned \\nagainst his staff and fixed his gaze on her. His scrutiny made Eragon nervous.\\nEragon watched \\nthem until hunger forced him to action. He built a fire, filled a pot with \\nsnow, and then set it over the flames to melt. When the water was hot, he tore \\noff chunks of meat and dropped them into the pot with a lump of salt.Not \\nmuch of a meal, he thought grimly,but it’ll do. I’ll probably be eating \\nthis for some time to come, so I might as well get used to it.\\nThe stew \\nsimmered quietly, spreading a rich aroma through the clearing. The tip of \\nSaphira’s tongue snaked out and tasted the air. When the meat was tender, Brom \\ncame over and Eragon served the food. They ate silently, avoiding each other’s \\neyes. Afterward, Brom pulled out his pipe and lit it leisurely.\\n“Why do you want \\nto travel with me?” asked Eragon.\\nA cloud of smoke \\nleft Brom’s lips and spiraled up through the trees until it disappeared. “I \\nhave a vested interest in keeping you alive,” he said.\\n“What do you \\nmean?” demanded Eragon.\\n“To put it \\nbluntly, I’m a storyteller and I happen to think that you will make a fine \\nstory. You’re the first Rider to exist outside of the king’s control for over a \\nhundred years. What will happen? Will you perish as a martyr? Will you join the \\nVarden? Or will you kill King Galbatorix? All fascinating questions. And I will \\nbe there to see every bit of it, no matter what I have to do.”\\nA knot formed in \\nEragon’s stomach. He could not see himself doing any of those things, least of \\nall becoming a martyr.I want my vengeance, but for the rest . . . I have no ambition. \\n“That may be, but tell me, how can you talk with Saphira?”\\nBrom took his \\ntime putting more tobacco in his pipe. Once it was relit and firmly in his \\nmouth, he said, “Very well, if it’s answers you want, it’s answers you’ll get, \\nbut they may not be to your liking.” He got up, brought his pack over to the \\nfire, and pulled out a long object wrapped in cloth. It was about five feet \\nlong and, from the way he handled it, rather heavy.\\nHe peeled away \\nthe cloth, strip by strip, like a mummy being unswathed. Eragon gazed, \\ntransfixed, as a sword was revealed. The gold pommel was teardrop shaped with \\nthe sides cut away to reveal a ruby the size of a small egg. The hilt was \\nwrapped in silver wire, burnished until it gleamed like starlight. The sheath \\nwas wine red and smooth as glass, adorned solely by a strange black symbol \\netched into it. Next to the sword was a leather belt with a heavy buckle. The \\nlast strip fell away, and Brom passed the weapon to Eragon.\\nThe handle fit \\nEragon’s hand as if it had been made for him. He slowly drew the sword; it slid \\nsoundlessly from the sheath. The flat blade was iridescent red and shimmered in \\nthe firelight. The keen edges curved gracefully to a sharp point. A duplicate \\nof the black symbol was inscribed on the metal. The balance of the sword was \\nperfect; it felt like an extension of his arm, unlike the rude farm tools he \\nwas used to. An air of power lay over it, as if an unstoppable force resided in \\nits core. It had been created for the violent convulsions of battle, to end men’s \\nlives, yet it held a terrible beauty.\\n“This was once a \\nRider’s blade,” said Brom gravely. “When a Rider finished his training, the \\nelves would present him with a sword. Their methods of forging have always \\nremained secret. However, their swords are eternally sharp and will never \\nstain. The custom was to have the blade’s color match that of the Rider’s \\ndragon, but I think we can make an exception in this case. This sword is named \\nZar’roc. I don’t know what it means, probably something personal to the Rider \\nwho owned it.” He watched Eragon swing the sword.\\n“Where did you \\nget it?” asked Eragon. He reluctantly slipped the blade back into the sheath \\nand attempted to hand the sword back, but Brom made no move to take it.\\n“It doesn’t \\nmatter,” said Brom. “I will only say that it took me a series of nasty and \\ndangerous adventures to attain it. Consider it yours. You have more of a claim \\nto it than I do, and before all is done, I think you will need it.”\\nThe offer caught \\nEragon off guard. “It is a princely gift, thank you.” Unsure of what else to \\nsay, he slid his hand down the sheath. “What is this symbol?” he asked.\\n“That was the \\nRider’s personal crest.” Eragon tried to interrupt, but Brom glared at him \\nuntil he was quiet. “Now, if you must know, anyone can learn how to speak to a \\ndragon if they have the proper training. And,” he raised a finger for emphasis, \\n“it doesn’t mean anything if they can. I know more about the dragons and their \\nabilities than almost anyone else alive. On your own it might take years to \\nlearn what I can teach you. I’m offering my knowledge as a shortcut. As for how \\nI know so much, I will keepthat to myself.”\\nSaphira pulled \\nherself up as he finished speaking and prowled over to Eragon. He pulled out \\nthe blade and showed her the sword.It has power, she said, touching the \\npoint with her nose. The metal’s iridescent color rippled like water as it met \\nher scales. She lifted her head with a satisfied snort, and the sword resumed \\nits normal appearance. Eragon sheathed it, troubled.\\nBrom raised an \\neyebrow. “That’s the sort of thing I’m talking about. Dragons will constantly \\namaze you. Things . . . happen around them, mysterious things that are \\nimpossible anywhere else. Even though the Riders worked with dragons for \\ncenturies, they never completely understood their abilities. Some say that even \\nthe dragons don’t know the full extent of their own powers. They are linked \\nwith this land in a way that lets them overcome great obstacles. What Saphira \\njust did illustrates my earlier point: there is much you don’t know.”\\nThere was a long \\npause. “That may be,” said Eragon, “but I can learn. And the strangers are the \\nmost important thing I need to know about right now. Do you have any idea who \\nthey are?”\\nBrom took a deep \\nbreath. “They are called the Ra’zac. No one knows if that’s the name of their \\nrace or what they have chosen to call themselves. Either way, if they have \\nindividual names, they keep them hidden. The Ra’zac were never seen before \\nGalbatorix came to power. He must have found them during his travels and \\nenlisted them in his service. Little or nothing is known about them. However, I \\ncan tell you this: they aren’t human. When I glimpsed one’s head, it appeared \\nto have something resembling a beak and black eyes as large as my fist—though \\nhow they manage our speech is a mystery to me. Doubtless the rest of their \\nbodies are just as twisted. That is why they cover themselves with cloaks at \\nall times, regardless of the weather.\\n“As for their \\npowers, they are stronger than any man and can jump incredible heights, but \\nthey cannot use magic. Be thankful for that, because if they could, you would \\nalready be in their grasp. I also know they have a strong aversion to sunlight, \\nthough it won’t stop them if they’re determined. Don’t make the mistake of \\nunderestimating a Ra’zac, for they are cunning and full of guile.”\\n“How many of \\nthem are there?” asked Eragon, wondering how Brom could possibly know so much.\\n“As far as I \\nknow, only the two you saw. There might be more, but I’ve never heard of them. \\nPerhaps they’re the last of a dying race. You see, they are the king’s personal \\ndragon hunters. Whenever rumors reach Galbatorix of a dragon in the land, he \\nsends the Ra’zac to investigate. A trail of death often follows them.” Brom \\nblew a series of smoke rings and watched them float up between the brambles. \\nEragon ignored the rings until he noticed that they were changing color and \\ndarting around. Brom winked slyly.\\nEragon was sure \\nthat no one had seen Saphira, so how could Galbatorix have heard about her? \\nWhen he voiced his objections, Brom said, “You’re right, it seems unlikely that \\nanyone from Carvahall could have informed the king. Why don’t you tell me where \\nyou got the egg and how you raised Saphira—that might clarify the issue.”\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then recounted all the events since he had found the egg in the \\nSpine. It felt wonderful to finally confide in someone. Brom asked a few \\nquestions, but most of the time he listened intently. The sun was about to set \\nwhen Eragon finished his tale. Both of them were quiet as the clouds turned a \\nsoft pink. Eragon eventually broke the silence. “I just wish I knew where she \\ncame from. And Saphira doesn’t remember.”\\nBrom cocked his \\nhead. “I don’t know. . . . You’ve made many things clear to me. I am sure that \\nno one besides us has seen Saphira. The Ra’zac must have had a source of \\ninformation outside of this valley, one who is probably dead by now. . . . You \\nhave had a hard time and done much. I’m impressed.”\\nEragon stared \\nblankly into the distance, then asked, “What happened to your head? It looks \\nlike you were hit with a rock.”\\n“No, but that’s \\na good guess.” He took a deep pull on the pipe. “I was sneaking around the \\nRa’zac’s camp after dark, trying to learn what I could, when they surprised me \\nin the shadows. It was a good trap, but they underestimated me, and I managed \\nto drive them away. Not, however,” he said wryly, “without this token of my \\nstupidity. Stunned, I fell to the ground and didn’t regain consciousness until \\nthe next day. By then they had already arrived at your farm. It was too late to \\nstop them, but I set out after them anyway. That’s when we met on the road.”\\nWho is he to \\nthink that he could take on the Ra’zac alone? They ambushed him in the dark, \\nand he was only stunned?Unsettled, Eragon asked hotly, “When you saw the \\nmark, the gedwëy ignasia, on my palm, why didn’t you tell me who the Ra’zac \\nwere? I would have warned Garrow instead of going to Saphira first, and the \\nthree of us could have fled.”\\nBrom sighed. “I \\nwas unsure of what to do at the time. I thought I could keep the Ra’zac away \\nfrom you and, once they had left, confront you about Saphira. But they \\noutsmarted me. It’s a mistake that I deeply regret, and one that has cost you \\ndearly.”\\n“Who are you?” \\ndemanded Eragon, suddenly bitter. “How come a mere village storyteller happens \\nto have a Rider’s sword? How do you know about the Ra’zac?”\\nBrom tapped his \\npipe. “I thought I made it clear I wasn’t going to talk about that.”\\n“My uncle is \\ndead because of this.Dead! ” exclaimed Eragon, slashing a hand through \\nthe air. “I’ve trusted you this far because Saphira respects you, but no more! \\nYou’re not the person I’ve known in Carvahall for all of these years. Explain \\nyourself!”\\nFor a long time \\nBrom stared at the smoke swirling between them, deep lines creasing his \\nforehead. When he stirred, it was only to take another puff. Finally he said, \\n“You’ve probably never thought about it, but most of my life has been spent \\noutside of Palancar Valley. It was only in Carvahall that I took up the mantle \\nof storyteller. I have played many roles to different people—I’ve a complicated \\npast. It was partly through a desire to escape it that I came here. So no, I’m \\nnot the man you think I am.”\\n“Ha!” snorted \\nEragon. “Then who are you?”\\nBrom smiled \\ngently. “I am one who is here to help you. Do not scorn those words—they are \\nthe truest I’ve ever spoken. But I’m not going to answer your questions. At \\nthis point you don’t need to hear my history, nor have you yet earned that \\nright. Yes, I have knowledge Brom the storyteller wouldn’t, but I’m more than \\nhe. You’ll have to learn to live with that fact and the fact that I don’t hand \\nout descriptions of my life to anyone who asks!”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim sullenly. “I’m going to sleep,” he said, leaving the fire.\\nBrom did not \\nseem surprised, but there was sorrow in his eyes. He spread his bedroll next to \\nthe fire as Eragon lay beside Saphira. An icy silence fell over the camp.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 20': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nS ADDLEMAKING \\nWhen Eragon’s \\neyes opened, the memory of Garrow’s death crashed down on him. He pulled the \\nblankets over his head and cried quietly under their warm darkness. It felt \\ngood just to lie there . . . to hide from the world outside. Eventually the \\ntears stopped. He cursed Brom. Then he reluctantly wiped his cheeks and got up.\\nBrom was making \\nbreakfast. “Good morning,” he said. Eragon grunted in reply. He jammed his cold \\nfingers in his armpits and crouched by the fire until the food was ready. They \\nate quickly, trying to consume the food before it lost its warmth. When he finished, \\nEragon washed his bowl with snow, then spread the stolen leather on the ground.\\n“What are you \\ngoing to do with that?” asked Brom. “We can’t carry it with us.”\\n“I’m going to \\nmake a saddle for Saphira.”\\n“Mmm,” said \\nBrom, moving forward. “Well, dragons used to have two kinds of saddles. The \\nfirst was hard and molded like a horse’s saddle. But those take time and tools \\nto make, neither of which we have. The other was thin and lightly padded, \\nnothing more than an extra layer between the Rider and dragon. Those saddles \\nwere used whenever speed and flexibility were important, though they weren’t \\nnearly as comfortable as the molded ones.”\\n“Do you know \\nwhat they looked like?” asked Eragon.\\n“Better, I can \\nmake one.”\\n“Then please \\ndo,” said Eragon, standing aside.\\n“Very well, but \\npay attention. Someday you may have to do this for yourself.” With Saphira’s \\npermission, Brom measured her neck and chest. Then he cut five bands out of the \\nleather and outlined a dozen or so shapes on the hides. Once the pieces had \\nbeen sliced out, he cut what remained of the hides into long cords.\\nBrom used the \\ncords to sew everything together, but for each stitch, two holes had to be \\nbored through the leather. Eragon helped with that. Intricate knots were rigged \\nin place of buckles, and every strap was made extra long so the saddle would \\nstill fit Saphira in the coming months.\\nThe main part of \\nthe saddle was assembled from three identical sections sewn together with \\npadding between them. Attached to the front was a thick loop that would fit \\nsnugly around one of Saphira’s neck spikes, while wide bands sewn on either \\nside would wrap around her belly and tie underneath. Taking the place of \\nstirrups were a series of loops running down both bands. Tightened, they would \\nhold Eragon’s legs in place. A long strap was constructed to pass between \\nSaphira’s front legs, split in two, and then come up behind her front legs to \\nrejoin with the saddle.\\nWhile Brom \\nworked, Eragon repaired his pack and organized their supplies. The day was \\nspent by the time their tasks were completed. Weary from his labor, Brom put \\nthe saddle on Saphira and checked to see that the straps fit. He made a few \\nsmall adjustments, then took it off, satisfied.\\n“You did a good \\njob,” Eragon acknowledged grudgingly.\\nBrom inclined \\nhis head. “One tries his best. It should serve you well; the leather’s sturdy \\nenough.”\\nAren’t you going \\nto try it out?asked \\nSaphira.\\nMaybe tomorrow,said Eragon, \\nstoring the saddle with his blankets.It’s too late now. In truth he was \\nnot eager to fly again—not after the disastrous outcome of his last attempt.\\nDinner was made \\nquickly. It tasted good even though it was simple. While they ate, Brom looked \\nover the fire at Eragon and asked, “Will we leave tomorrow?”\\n“There isn’t any \\nreason to stay.”\\n“I suppose not. \\n. . .” He shifted. “Eragon, I must apologize about how events have turned out. \\nI never wished for this to happen. Your family did not deserve such a tragedy. \\nIf there were anything I could do to reverse it, I would. This is a terrible \\nsituation for all of us.” Eragon sat in silence, avoiding Brom’s gaze, then \\nBrom said, “We’re going to need horses.”\\n“Maybe you do, \\nbut I have Saphira.”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “There isn’t a horse alive that can outrun a flying dragon, and Saphira \\nis too young to carry us both. Besides, it’ll be safer if we stay together, and \\nriding is faster than walking.”\\n“But that’ll \\nmake it harder to catch the Ra’zac,” protested Eragon. “On Saphira, I could \\nprobably find them within a day or two. On horses, it’ll take much longer—if \\nit’s even possible to overtake their lead on the ground!”\\nBrom said \\nslowly, “That’s a chance you’ll have to take if I’m to accompany you.”\\nEragon thought \\nit over. “All right,” he grumbled, “we’ll get horses. But you have to buy them. \\nI don’t have any money, and I don’t want to steal again. It’s wrong.”\\n“That depends on \\nyour point of view,” corrected Brom with a slight smile. “Before you set out on \\nthis venture, remember that your enemies, the Ra’zac, are the king’s servants. \\nThey will be protected wherever they go. Laws do not stop them. In cities \\nthey’ll have access to abundant resources and willing servants. Also keep in \\nmind that nothing is more important to Galbatorix than recruiting or killing \\nyou—though word of your existence probably hasn’t reached him yet. The longer \\nyou evade the Ra’zac, the more desperate he’ll become. He’ll know that every \\nday you’ll be growing stronger and that each passing moment will give you \\nanother chance to join his enemies. You must be very careful, as you may easily \\nturn from the hunter into the hunted.”\\nEragon was \\nsubdued by the strong words. Pensive, he rolled a twig between his fingers. \\n“Enough talk,” said Brom. “It’s late and my bones ache. We can say more \\ntomorrow.” Eragon nodded and banked the fire.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 21': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HERINSFORD \\nDawn was gray and \\novercast with a cutting wind. The forest was quiet. After a light breakfast, \\nBrom and Eragon doused the fire and shouldered their packs, preparing to leave. \\nEragon hung his bow and quiver on the side of his pack where he could easily \\nreach them. Saphira wore the saddle; she would have to carry it until they got \\nhorses. Eragon carefully tied Zar’roc onto her back, too, as he did not want \\nthe extra weight. Besides, in his hands the sword would be no better than a \\nclub.\\nEragon had felt \\nsafe inside the bramble, but outside, wariness crept into his movements. \\nSaphira took off and circled overhead. The trees thinned as they returned to \\nthe farm.\\nI will see this \\nplace again,Eragon \\ninsisted to himself, looking at the ruined buildings.This cannot, will not, \\nbe a permanent exile. Someday when it’s safe, I’ll return. . . . Throwing \\nback his shoulders, he faced south and the strange, barbaric lands that lay \\nthere.\\nAs they walked, \\nSaphira veered west toward the mountains and out of sight. Eragon felt \\nuncomfortable as he watched her go. Even now, with no one around, they could \\nnot spend their days together. She had to stay hidden in case they met a fellow \\ntraveler.\\nThe Ra’zac’s \\nfootprints were faint on the eroding snow, but Eragon was unconcerned. It was \\nunlikely that they had forsaken the road, which was the easiest way out of the \\nvalley, for the wilderness. Once outside the valley, however, the road divided \\nin several places. It would be difficult to ascertain which branch the Ra’zac \\nhad taken.\\nThey traveled in \\nsilence, concentrating on speed. Eragon’s legs continued to bleed where the \\nscabs had cracked. To take his mind off the discomfort, he asked, “So what \\nexactly can dragons do? You said that you knew something of their abilities.”\\nBrom laughed, \\nhis sapphire ring flashing in the air as he gestured. “Unfortunately, it’s a \\npitiful amount compared to what I would like to know. Your question is one \\npeople have been trying to answer for centuries, so understand that what I tell \\nyou is by its very nature incomplete. Dragons have always been mysterious, \\nthough maybe not on purpose.\\n“Before I can \\ntruly answer your question, you need a basic education on the subject of \\ndragons. It’s hopelessly confusing to start in the middle of such a complex \\ntopic without understanding the foundation on which it stands. I’ll begin with \\nthe life cycle of dragons, and if that doesn’t wear you out, we can continue to \\nanother topic.”\\nBrom explained \\nhow dragons mate and what it took for their eggs to hatch. “You see,” he said, \\n“when a dragon lays an egg, the infant inside is ready to hatch. But it waits, \\nsometimes for years, for the right circumstances. When dragons lived in the \\nwild, those circumstances were usually dictated by the availability of food. \\nHowever, once they formed an alliance with the elves, a certain number of their \\neggs, usually no more than one or two, were given to the Riders each year. \\nThese eggs, or rather the infants inside, wouldn’t hatch until the person \\ndestined to be its Rider came into their presence—though how they sensed that \\nisn’t known. People used to line up to touch the eggs, hoping that one of them \\nmight be picked.”\\n“Do you mean \\nthat Saphira might not have hatched for me?” asked Eragon.\\n“Quite possibly, \\nif she hadn’t liked you.”\\nHe felt honored \\nthat of all the people in Alagaësia, she had chosen him. He wondered how long \\nshe had been waiting, then shuddered at the thought of being cramped inside an \\negg, surrounded by darkness.\\nBrom continued \\nhis lecture. He explained what and when dragons ate. A fully grown sedentary \\ndragon could go for months without food, but in mating season they had to eat \\nevery week. Some plants could heal their sicknesses, while others would make \\nthem ill. There were various ways to care for their claws and clean their \\nscales.\\nHe explained the \\ntechniques to use when attacking from a dragon and what to do if you were \\nfighting one, whether on foot, horseback, or with another dragon. Their bellies \\nwere armored; their armpits were not. Eragon constantly interrupted to ask \\nquestions, and Brom seemed pleased by the inquiries. Hours passed unheeded as \\nthey talked.\\nWhen evening \\ncame, they were near Therinsford. As the sky darkened and they searched for a \\nplace to camp, Eragon asked, “Who was the Rider that owned Zar’roc?”\\n“A mighty \\nwarrior,” said Brom, “who was much feared in his time and held great power.”\\n“What was his \\nname?”\\n“I’ll not say.” \\nEragon protested, but Brom was firm. “I don’t want to keep you ignorant, far \\nfrom it, but certain knowledge would only prove dangerous and distracting for \\nyou right now. There isn’t any reason for me to trouble you with such things \\nuntil you have the time and the power to deal with them. I only wish to protect \\nyou from those who would use you for evil.”\\nEragon glared at \\nhim. “You know what? I think you just enjoy speaking in riddles. I’ve half a \\nmind to leave you so I don’t have to be bothered with them. If you’re going to \\nsay something, then say it instead of dancing around with vague phrases!”\\n“Peace. All will \\nbe told in time,” Brom said gently. Eragon grunted, unconvinced.\\nThey found a \\ncomfortable place to spend the night and set up camp. Saphira joined them as \\ndinner was being set on the fire.Did you have time to hunt for food? \\nasked Eragon.\\nShe snorted with \\namusement.If the two of you were any slower, I would have time to fly across \\nthe sea and back without falling behind.\\nYou don’t have \\nto be insulting. Besides, we’ll go faster once we have horses. \\nShe let out a \\npuff of smoke.Maybe, but will it be enough to catch the Ra’zac? They have a \\nlead of several days and many leagues. And I’m afraid they may suspect we’re \\nfollowing them. Why else would they have destroyed the farm in such a \\nspectacular manner, unless they wished to provoke you into chasing them?\\nI don’t know,said Eragon, \\ndisturbed. Saphira curled up beside him, and he leaned against her belly, \\nwelcoming the warmth. Brom sat on the other side of the fire, whittling two \\nlong sticks. He suddenly threw one at Eragon, who grabbed it out of reflex as \\nit whirled over the crackling flames.\\n“Defend \\nyourself!” barked Brom, standing.\\nEragon looked at \\nthe stick in his hand and saw that it was shaped in the crude likeness of a \\nsword. Brom wanted to fight him? What chance did the old man stand?If he \\nwants to play this game, so be it, but if he thinks to beat me, he’s in for a \\nsurprise.\\nHe rose as Brom \\ncircled the fire. They faced each other for a moment, then Brom charged, \\nswinging his stick. Eragon tried to block the attack but was too slow. He \\nyelped as Brom struck him on the ribs, and stumbled backward.\\nWithout \\nthinking, he lunged forward, but Brom easily parried the blow. Eragon whipped \\nthe stick toward Brom’s head, twisted it at the last moment, and then tried to \\nhit his side. The solid smack of wood striking wood resounded through the camp. \\n“Improvisation—good!” exclaimed Brom, eyes gleaming. His arm moved in a blur, \\nand there was an explosion of pain on the side of Eragon’s head. He collapsed \\nlike an empty sack, dazed.\\nA splash of cold \\nwater roused him to alertness, and he sat up, sputtering. His head was ringing, \\nand there was dried blood on his face. Brom stood over him with a pan of melted \\nsnow water. “You didn’t have to do that,” said Eragon angrily, pushing himself \\nup. He felt dizzy and unsteady.\\nBrom arched an \\neyebrow. “Oh? A real enemy wouldn’t soften his blows, and neither will I. \\nShould I pander to your . . . incompetence so you’ll feel better? I don’t think \\nso.” He picked up the stick that Eragon had dropped and held it out. “Now, \\ndefend yourself.”\\nEragon stared \\nblankly at the piece of wood, then shook his head. “Forget it; I’ve had \\nenough.” He turned away and stumbled as he was whacked loudly across the back. \\nHe spun around, growling.\\n“Never turn your \\nback to the enemy!” snapped Brom, then tossed the stick at him and attacked. \\nEragon retreated around the fire, beneath the onslaught. “Pull your arms in. \\nKeep your knees bent,” shouted Brom. He continued to give instructions, then \\npaused to show Eragon exactly how to execute a certain move. “Do it again, but \\nthis timeslowly !” They slid through the forms with exaggerated motions \\nbefore returning to their furious battle. Eragon learned quickly, but no matter \\nwhat he tried, he could not hold Brom off for more than a few blows.\\nWhen they \\nfinished, Eragon flopped on his blankets and groaned. He hurt everywhere—Brom \\nhad not been gentle with his stick. Saphira let out a long, coughing growl and \\ncurled her lip until a formidable row of teeth showed.\\nWhat’s wrong \\nwith you?he \\ndemanded irritably.\\nNothing,she replied.It’s \\nfunny to see a hatchling like you beaten by the old one. She made the sound \\nagain, and Eragon turned red as he realized that she was laughing. Trying to \\npreserve some dignity, he rolled onto his side and fell asleep.\\nHe felt even \\nworse the next day. Bruises covered his arms, and he was almost too sore to \\nmove. Brom looked up from the mush he was serving and grinned. “How do you \\nfeel?” Eragon grunted and bolted down the breakfast.\\nOnce on the \\nroad, they traveled swiftly so as to reach Therinsford before noon. After a league, \\nthe road widened and they saw smoke in the distance. “You’d better tell Saphira \\nto fly ahead and wait for us on the other side of Therinsford,” said Brom. “She \\nhas to be careful here, otherwise people are bound to notice her.”\\n“Why don’t you \\ntell her yourself?” challenged Eragon.\\n“It’s considered \\nbad manners to interfere with another’s dragon.”\\n“You didn’t have \\na problem with it in Carvahall.”\\nBrom’s lips \\ntwitched with a smile. “I did what I had to.”\\nEragon eyed him \\ndarkly, then relayed the instructions. Saphira warned,Be careful; the \\nEmpire’s servants could be hiding anywhere.\\nAs the ruts in \\nthe road deepened, Eragon noticed more footprints. Farms signaled their \\napproach to Therinsford. The village was larger than Carvahall, but it had been \\nconstructed haphazardly, the houses aligned in no particular order.\\n“What a mess,” \\nsaid Eragon. He could not see Dempton’s mill.Baldor and Albriech have surely \\nfetched Roran by now. Either way, Eragon had no wish to face his cousin.\\n“It’s ugly, if \\nnothing else,” agreed Brom.\\nThe Anora River \\nflowed between them and the town, spanned by a stout bridge. As they approached \\nit, a greasy man stepped from behind a bush and barred their way. His shirt was \\ntoo short, and his dirty stomach spilled over a rope belt. Behind his cracked \\nlips, his teeth looked like crumbling tombstones. “You c’n stop right there. \\nThis’s my bridge. Gotta pay t’ get over.”\\n“How much?” \\nasked Brom in a resigned voice. He pulled out a pouch, and the bridgekeeper \\nbrightened.\\n“Five crowns,” \\nhe said, pulling his lips into a broad smile. Eragon’s temper flared at the \\nexorbitant price, and he started to complain hotly, but Brom silenced him with \\na quick look. The coins were wordlessly handed over. The man put them into a \\nsack hanging from his belt. “Thank’ee much,” he said in a mocking tone, and \\nstood out of the way.\\nAs Brom stepped \\nforward, he stumbled and caught the bridgekeeper’s arm to support himself. \\n“Watch y’re step,” snarled the grimy man, sidling away.\\n“Sorry,” \\napologized Brom, and continued over the bridge with Eragon.\\n“Why didn’t you \\nhaggle? He skinned you alive!” exclaimed Eragon when they were out of earshot. \\n“He probably doesn’t even own the bridge. We could have pushed right past him.”\\n“Probably,” \\nagreed Brom.\\n“Then why pay \\nhim?”\\n“Because you can’t \\nargue with all of the fools in the world. It’s easier to let them have their \\nway, then trick them when they’re not paying attention.” Brom opened his hand, \\nand a pile of coins glinted in the light.\\n“You cut his \\npurse!” said Eragon incredulously.\\nBrom pocketed \\nthe money with a wink. “And it held a surprising amount. He should know better \\nthan to keep all these coins in one place.” There was a sudden howl of anguish \\nfrom the other side of the river. “I’d say our friend has just discovered his \\nloss. If you see any watchmen, tell me.” He grabbed the shoulder of a young boy \\nrunning between the houses and asked, “Do you know where we can buy horses?” \\nThe child stared at them with solemn eyes, then pointed to a large barn near \\nthe edge of Therinsford. “Thank you,” said Brom, tossing him a small coin.\\nThe barn’s large \\ndouble doors were open, revealing two long rows of stalls. The far wall was \\ncovered with saddles, harnesses, and other paraphernalia. A man with muscular \\narms stood at the end, brushing a white stallion. He raised a hand and beckoned \\nfor them to come over.\\nAs they \\napproached, Brom said, “That’s a beautiful animal.”\\n“Yes indeed. His \\nname’s Snowfire. Mine’s Haberth.” Haberth offered a rough palm and shook hands \\nvigorously with Eragon and Brom. There was a polite pause as he waited for \\ntheir names in return. When they were not forthcoming, he asked, “Can I help \\nyou?”\\nBrom nodded. “We \\nneed two horses and a full set of tack for both. The horses have to be fast and \\ntough; we’ll be doing a lot of traveling.”\\nHaberth was \\nthoughtful for a moment. “I don’t have many animals like that, and the ones I \\ndo aren’t cheap.” The stallion moved restlessly; he calmed it with a few \\nstrokes of his fingers.\\n“Price is no \\nobject. I’ll take the best you have,” said Brom. Haberth nodded and silently \\ntied the stallion to a stall. He went to the wall and started pulling down \\nsaddles and other items. Soon he had two identical piles. Next he walked up the \\nline of stalls and brought out two horses. One was a light bay, the other a roan. \\nThe bay tugged against his rope.\\n“He’s a little \\nspirited, but with a firm hand you won’t have any problems,” said Haberth, \\nhanding the bay’s rope to Brom.\\nBrom let the \\nhorse smell his hand; it allowed him to rub its neck. “We’ll take him,” he \\nsaid, then eyed the roan. “The other one, however, I’m not so sure of.”\\n“There are some \\ngood legs on him.”\\n“Mmm . . . What \\nwill you take for Snowfire?”\\nHaberth looked \\nfondly at the stallion. “I’d rather not sell him. He’s the finest I’ve ever \\nbred—I’m hoping to sire a whole line from him.”\\n“If you were \\nwilling to part with him, how much would all of this cost me?” asked Brom.\\nEragon tried to \\nput his hand on the bay like Brom had, but it shied away. He automatically \\nreached out with his mind to reassure the horse, stiffening with surprise as he \\ntouched the animal’s consciousness. The contact was not clear or sharp like it \\nwas with Saphira, but he could communicate with the bay to a limited degree. \\nTentatively, he made it understand that he was a friend. The horse calmed and \\nlooked at him with liquid brown eyes.\\nHaberth used his \\nfingers to add up the price of the purchase. “Two hundred crowns and no less,” \\nhe said with a smile, clearly confident that no one would pay that much. Brom \\nsilently opened his pouch and counted out the money.\\n“Will this do?” \\nhe asked.\\nThere was a long \\nsilence as Haberth glanced between Snowfire and the coins. A sigh, then, “He is \\nyours, though I go against my heart.”\\n“I will treat \\nhim as if he had been sired by Gildintor, the greatest steed of legend,” said \\nBrom.\\n“Your words \\ngladden me,” answered Haberth, bowing his head slightly. He helped them saddle \\nthe horses. When they were ready to leave, he said, “Farewell, then. For the \\nsake of Snowfire, I hope that misfortune does not befall you.”\\n“Do not fear; I \\nwill guard him well,” promised Brom as they departed. “Here,” he said, handing \\nSnowfire’s reins to Eragon, “go to the far side of Therinsford and wait there.”\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon, but Brom had already slipped away. Annoyed, he exited Therinsford with \\nthe two horses and stationed himself beside the road. To the south he saw the \\nhazy outline of Utgard, sitting like a giant monolith at the end of the valley. \\nIts peak pierced the clouds and rose out of sight, towering over the lesser \\nmountains that surrounded it. Its dark, ominous look made Eragon’s scalp \\ntingle.\\nBrom returned \\nshortly and gestured for Eragon to follow. They walked until Therinsford was \\nhidden by trees. Then Brom said, “The Ra’zac definitely passed this way. \\nApparently they stopped here to pick up horses, as we did. I was able to find a \\nman who saw them. He described them with many shudders and said that they \\ngalloped out of Therinsford like demons fleeing a holy man.”\\n“They left quite \\nan impression.”\\n“Quite.”\\nEragon patted \\nthe horses. “When we were in the barn, I touched the bay’s mind by accident. I \\ndidn’t know it was possible to do that.”\\nBrom frowned. \\n“It’s unusual for one as young as you to have the ability. Most Riders had to \\ntrain for years before they were strong enough to contact anything other than \\ntheir dragon.” His face was thoughtful as he inspected Snowfire. Then he said, \\n“Take everything from your pack, put it into the saddlebags, and tie the pack \\non top.” Eragon did so while Brom mounted Snowfire.\\nEragon gazed \\ndoubtfully at the bay. It was so much smaller than Saphira that for an absurd \\nmoment he wondered if it could bear his weight. With a sigh, he awkwardly got \\ninto the saddle. He had only ridden horses bareback and never for any distance. \\n“Is this going to do the same thing to my legs as riding Saphira?” he asked.\\n“How do they \\nfeel now?”\\n“Not too bad, \\nbut I think any hard riding will open them up again.”\\n“We’ll take it \\neasy,” promised Brom. He gave Eragon a few pointers, then they started off at a \\ngentle pace. Before long the countryside began to change as cultivated fields \\nyielded to wilder land. Brambles and tangled weeds lined the road, along with \\nhuge rosebushes that clung to their clothes. Tall rocks slanted out of the \\nground—gray witnesses to their presence. There was an unfriendly feel in the \\nair, an animosity that resisted intruders.\\nAbove them, \\ngrowing larger with every step, loomed Utgard, its craggy precipices deeply \\nfurrowed with snowy canyons. The black rock of the mountain absorbed light like \\na sponge and dimmed the surrounding area. Between Utgard and the line of \\nmountains that formed the east side of Palancar Valley was a deep cleft. It was \\nthe only practical way out of the valley. The road led toward it.\\nThe horses’ \\nhooves clacked sharply over gravel, and the road dwindled to a skinny trail as \\nit skirted the base of Utgard. Eragon glanced up at the peak looming over them \\nand was startled to see a steepled tower perched upon it. The turret was \\ncrumbling and in disrepair, but it was still a stern sentinel over the valley. \\n“What is that?” he asked, pointing.\\nBrom did not \\nlook up, but said sadly and with bitterness, “An outpost of the Riders—one that \\nhas lasted since their founding. That was where Vrael took refuge, and where, \\nthrough treachery, he was found and defeated by Galbatorix. When Vrael fell, \\nthis area was tainted. Edoc’sil, ‘Unconquerable,’ was the name of this bastion, \\nfor the mountain is so steep none may reach the top unless they can fly. After \\nVrael’s death the commoners called it Utgard, but it has another name, \\nRistvak’baen—the ‘Place of Sorrow.’ It was known as such to the last Riders \\nbefore they were killed by the king.”\\nEragon stared \\nwith awe. Here was a tangible remnant of the Riders’ glory, tarnished though it \\nwas by the relentless pull of time. It struck him then just how old the Riders \\nwere. A legacy of tradition and heroism that stretched back to antiquity had \\nfallen upon him.\\nThey traveled \\nfor long hours around Utgard. It formed a solid wall to their right as they \\nentered the breach that divided the mountain range. Eragon stood in his \\nstirrups; he was impatient to see what lay outside of Palancar, but it was \\nstill too far away. For a while they were in a sloped pass, winding over hill \\nand gully, following the Anora River. Then, with the sun low behind their \\nbacks, they mounted a rise and saw over the trees.\\nEragon gasped. \\nOn either side were mountains, but below them stretched a huge plain that \\nextended to the distant horizon and fused into the sky. The plain was a uniform \\ntan, like the color of dead grass. Long, wispy clouds swept by overhead, shaped \\nby fierce winds.\\nHe understood \\nnow why Brom had insisted on horses. It would have taken them weeks or months \\nto cover that vast distance on foot. Far above he saw Saphira circling, high \\nenough to be mistaken for a bird.\\n“We’ll wait \\nuntil tomorrow to make the descent,” said Brom. “It’s going to take most of the \\nday, so we should camp now.”\\n“How far across \\nis the plain?” Eragon asked, still amazed.\\n“Two or three \\ndays to over a fortnight, depending on which direction we go. Aside from the \\nnomad tribes that roam this section of the plains, it’s almost as uninhabited \\nas the Hadarac Desert to the east. So we aren’t going to find many villages. \\nHowever, to the south the plains are less arid and more heavily populated.”\\nThey left the \\ntrail and dismounted by the Anora River. As they unsaddled the horses, Brom \\ngestured at the bay. “You should name him.”\\nEragon \\nconsidered it as he picketed the bay. “Well, I don’t have anything as noble as \\nSnowfire, but maybe this will do.” He placed his hand on the bay and said, “I \\nname you Cadoc. It was my grandfather’s name, so bear it well.” Brom nodded in \\napproval, but Eragon felt slightly foolish.\\nWhen Saphira \\nlanded, he asked, How do the plains look?\\nDull. There’s \\nnothing but rabbits and scrub in every direction. \\nAfter dinner, \\nBrom stood and barked, “Catch!” Eragon barely had time to raise his arm and \\ngrab the piece of wood before it hit him on the head. He groaned as he saw \\nanother makeshift sword.\\n“Not again,” he \\ncomplained. Brom just smiled and beckoned with one hand. Eragon reluctantly got \\nto his feet. They whirled around in a flurry of smacking wood, and he backed \\naway with a stinging arm.\\nThe training \\nsession was shorter than the first, but it was still long enough for Eragon to \\namass a new collection of bruises. When they finished sparring, he threw down \\nthe stick in disgust and stalked away from the fire to nurse his injuries.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 22': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HUNDERROAR ANDLIGHTNINGCRACKLE\\nThe next morning Eragon \\navoided bringing to mind any of the recent events; they were too painful for \\nhim to consider. Instead, he focused his energies on figuring out how to find \\nand kill the Ra’zac.I’ll do it with my bow, he decided, imagining how \\nthe cloaked figures would look with arrows sticking out of them.\\nHe had \\ndifficulty even standing up. His muscles cramped with the slightest movement, \\nand one of his fingers was hot and swollen. When they were ready to leave, he \\nmounted Cadoc and said acidly, “If this keeps up, you’re going to batter me to \\npieces.”\\n“I wouldn’t push \\nyou so hard if I didn’t think you were strong enough.”\\n“For once, I \\nwouldn’t mind being thought less of,” muttered Eragon.\\nCadoc pranced \\nnervously as Saphira approached. Saphira eyed the horse with something close to \\ndisgust and said,There’s nowhere to hide on the plains, so I’m not going to \\nbother trying to stay out of sight. I’ll just fly above you from now on.\\nShe took off, \\nand they began the steep descent. In many places the trail all but disappeared, \\nleaving them to find their own way down. At times they had to dismount and lead \\nthe horses on foot, holding on to trees to keep from falling down the slope. \\nThe ground was scattered with loose rocks, which made the footing treacherous. \\nThe ordeal left them hot and irritable, despite the cold.\\nThey stopped to \\nrest when they reached the bottom near midday. The Anora River veered to their \\nleft and flowed northward. A biting wind scoured the land, whipping them \\nunmercifully. The soil was parched, and dirt flew into their eyes.\\nIt unnerved \\nEragon how flat everything was; the plains were unbroken by hummocks or mounds. \\nHe had lived his entire life surrounded by mountains and hills. Without them he \\nfelt exposed and vulnerable, like a mouse under an eagle’s keen eye.\\nThe trail split \\nin three once it reached the plains. The first branch turned north, toward \\nCeunon, one of the greatest northern cities; the second one led straight across \\nthe plains; and the last went south. They examined all three for traces of the \\nRa’zac and eventually found their tracks, heading directly into the grasslands.\\n“It seems \\nthey’ve gone to Yazuac,” said Brom with a perplexed air.\\n“Where’s that?”\\n“Due east and \\nfour days away, if all goes well. It’s a small village situated by the Ninor \\nRiver.” He gestured at the Anora, which streamed away from them to the north. \\n“Our only supply of water is here. We’ll have to replenish our waterskins \\nbefore attempting to cross the plains. There isn’t another pool or stream \\nbetween here and Yazuac.”\\nThe excitement \\nof the hunt began to rise within Eragon. In a few days, maybe less than a week, \\nhe would use his arrows to avenge Garrow’s death.And then . . . He \\nrefused to think about what might happen afterward.\\nThey filled the \\nwaterskins, watered the horses, and drank as much as they could from the river. \\nSaphira joined them and took several gulps of water. Fortified, they turned \\neastward and started across the plains.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon decided \\nthat it would be the wind that drove him crazy first. Everything that made him \\nmiserable—his chapped lips, parched tongue, and burning eyes—stemmed from it. \\nThe ceaseless gusting followed them throughout the day. Evening only \\nstrengthened the wind, instead of subduing it.\\nSince there was \\nno shelter, they were forced to camp in the open. Eragon found some scrub \\nbrush, a short tough plant that thrived on harsh conditions, and pulled it up. \\nHe made a careful pile and tried to light it, but the woody stems only smoked \\nand gave off a pungent smell. Frustrated, he tossed the tinderbox to Brom. “I \\ncan’t make it burn, especially with this blasted wind. See if you can get it \\ngoing: otherwise dinner will be cold.”\\nBrom knelt by \\nthe brush and looked at it critically. He rearranged a couple of branches, then \\nstruck the tinderbox, sending a cascade of sparks onto the plants. There was \\nsmoke, but nothing else. Brom scowled and tried again, but his luck was no \\nbetter than Eragon’s. “Brisingr!” he swore angrily, striking the flint again. \\nFlames suddenly appeared, and he stepped back with a pleased expression. “There \\nwe go. It must have been smoldering inside.”\\nThey sparred \\nwith mock swords while the food cooked. Fatigue made it hard on both of them, \\nso they kept the session short. After they had eaten, they lay next to Saphira \\nand slept, grateful for her shelter.\\nThe same cold \\nwind greeted them in the morning, sweeping over the dreadful flatness. Eragon’s \\nlips had cracked during the night; every time he smiled or talked, beads of \\nblood covered them. Licking them only made it worse. It was the same for Brom. \\nThey let the horses drink sparingly from their supply of water before mounting \\nthem. The day was a monotonous trek of endless plodding.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the third \\nday, Eragon woke well rested. That, coupled with the fact that the wind had stopped, \\nput him in a cheery humor. His high spirits were dampened, however, when he saw \\nthe sky ahead of them was dark with thunderheads.\\nBrom looked at \\nthe clouds and grimaced. “Normally I wouldn’t go into a storm like that, but \\nwe’re in for a battering no matter what we do, so we might as well get some \\ndistance covered.”\\nIt was still \\ncalm when they reached the storm front. As they entered its shadow, Eragon \\nlooked up. The thundercloud had an exotic structure, forming a natural \\ncathedral with a massive arched roof. With some imagination he could see \\npillars, windows, soaring tiers, and snarling gargoyles. It was a wild beauty.\\nAs Eragon \\nlowered his gaze, a giant ripple raced toward them through the grass, \\nflattening it. It took him a second to realize that the wave was a tremendous \\nblast of wind. Brom saw it too, and they hunched their shoulders, preparing for \\nthe storm.\\nThe gale was \\nalmost upon them when Eragon had a horrible thought and twisted in his saddle, \\nyelling, both with his voice and mind,“Saphira! Land!” Brom’s face grew \\npale. Overhead, they saw her dive toward the ground.She’s not going to make \\nit!\\nSaphira angled \\nback the way they had come, to gain time. As they watched, the tempest’s wrath \\nstruck them like a hammer blow. Eragon gasped for breath and clenched the \\nsaddle as a frenzied howling filled his ears. Cadoc swayed and dug his hooves \\ninto the ground, mane snapping in the air. The wind tore at their clothes with \\ninvisible fingers while the air darkened with billowing clouds of dust.\\nEragon squinted, \\nsearching for Saphira. He saw her land heavily and then crouch, clenching the \\nground with her talons. The wind reached her just as she started to fold her \\nwings. With an angry yank, it unfurled them and dragged her into the air. For a \\nmoment she hung there, suspended by the storm’s force. Then it slammed her down \\non her back.\\nWith a savage \\nwrench, Eragon yanked Cadoc around and galloped back up the trail, goading the \\nhorse with both heels and mind.Saphira! he shouted.Try to stay on the \\nground. I’m coming! He felt a grim acknowledgment from her. As they neared \\nSaphira, Cadoc balked, so Eragon leapt down and ran toward her.\\nHis bow banged \\nagainst his head. A strong gust pushed him off balance and he flew forward, \\nlanding on his chest. He skidded, then got back up with a snarl, ignoring the \\ndeep scrapes in his skin.\\nSaphira was only \\nthree yards away, but he could get no closer because of her flailing wings. She \\nstruggled to fold them against the overpowering gale. He rushed at her right \\nwing, intending to hold it down, but the wind caught her and she somersaulted \\nover him. The spines on her back missed his head by inches. Saphira clawed at \\nthe ground, trying to stay down.\\nHer wings began \\nto lift again, but before they could flip her, Eragon threw himself at the left \\none. The wing crumpled in at the joints and Saphira tucked it firmly against \\nher body. Eragon vaulted over her back and tumbled onto the other wing. Without \\nwarning it was blown upward, sending him sliding to ground. He broke his fall \\nwith a roll, then jumped up and grabbed the wing again. Saphira started to fold \\nit, and he pushed with all of his strength. The wind battled with them for a \\nsecond, but with one last surge they overcame it.\\nEragon leaned \\nagainst Saphira, panting.Are you all right? He could feel her trembling.\\nShe took a \\nmoment to answer.I . . . I think so. She sounded shaken.Nothing’s \\nbroken—I couldn’t do anything; the wind wouldn’t let me go. I was helpless. \\nWith a shudder, she fell silent.\\nHe looked at \\nher, concerned.Don’t worry, you’re safe now. He spotted Cadoc a ways \\noff, standing with his back to the wind. With his mind, Eragon instructed the \\nhorse to return to Brom. He then got onto Saphira. She crept up the road, \\nfighting the gale while he clung to her back and kept his head down.\\nWhen they \\nreached Brom, he shouted over the storm, “Is she hurt?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead and dismounted. Cadoc trotted over to him, nickering. As he stroked the \\nhorse’s long cheek, Brom pointed at a dark curtain of rain sweeping toward them \\nin rippling gray sheets. “What else?” cried Eragon, pulling his clothes \\ntighter. He winced as the torrent reached them. The stinging rain was cold as \\nice; before long they were drenched and shivering.\\nLightning lanced \\nthrough the sky, flickering in and out of existence. Mile-high blue bolts \\nstreaked across the horizon, followed by peals of thunder that shook the ground \\nbelow. It was beautiful, but dangerously so. Here and there, grass fires were \\nignited by strikes, only to be extinguished by the rain.\\nThe wild elements \\nwere slow to abate, but as the day passed, they wandered elsewhere. Once again \\nthe sky was revealed, and the setting sun glowed with brilliance. As beams of \\nlight tinted the clouds with blazing colors, everything gained a sharp \\ncontrast: brightly lit on one side, deeply shadowed on the other. Objects had a \\nunique sense of mass; grass stalks seemed sturdy as marble pillars. Ordinary \\nthings took on an unearthly beauty; Eragon felt as if he were sitting inside a \\npainting.\\nThe rejuvenated \\nearth smelled fresh, clearing their minds and raising their spirits. Saphira \\nstretched, craning her neck, and roared happily. The horses skittered away from \\nher, but Eragon and Brom smiled at her exuberance.\\nBefore the light \\nfaded, they stopped for the night in a shallow depression. Too exhausted to \\nspar, they went straight to sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 23': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nR EVELATION ATYAZUAC\\nAlthough they had \\nmanaged to partially refill the waterskins during the storm, they drank the \\nlast of their water that morning. “I hope we’re going in the right direction,” \\nsaid Eragon, crunching up the empty water bag, “because we’ll be in trouble if \\nwe don’t reach Yazuac today.”\\nBrom did not \\nseem disturbed. “I’ve traveled this way before. Yazuac will be in sight before \\ndusk.”\\nEragon laughed \\ndoubtfully. “Perhaps you see something I don’t. How can you know that when \\neverything looks exactly the same for leagues around?”\\n“Because I am \\nguided not by the land, but by the stars and sun. They will not lead us astray. \\nCome! Let us be off. It is foolish to conjure up woe where none exists. Yazuac \\nwill be there.”\\nHis words proved \\ntrue. Saphira spotted the village first, but it was not until later in the day \\nthat the rest of them saw it as a dark bump on the horizon. Yazuac was still \\nvery far away; it was only visible because of the plain’s uniform flatness. As \\nthey rode closer, a dark winding line appeared on either side of the town and \\ndisappeared in the distance.\\n“The Ninor \\nRiver,” said Brom, pointing at it.\\nEragon pulled \\nCadoc to a stop. “Saphira will be seen if she stays with us much longer. Should \\nshe hide while we go into Yazuac?”\\nBrom scratched \\nhis chin and looked at the town. “See that bend in the river? Have her wait \\nthere. It’s far enough from Yazuac so no one should find her, but close enough \\nthat she won’t be left behind. We’ll go through the town, get what we need, and \\nthen meet her.”\\nI don’t like it,said Saphira \\nwhen Eragon had explained the plan.This is irritating, having to hide all \\nthe time like a criminal.\\nYou know what \\nwould happen if we were revealed.She grumbled but gave in and flew away \\nlow to the ground.\\nThey kept a \\nswift pace in anticipation of the food and drink they would soon enjoy. As they \\napproached the small houses, they could see smoke from a dozen chimneys, but \\nthere was no one in the streets. An abnormal silence enveloped the village. By \\nunspoken consent they stopped before the first house. Eragon abruptly said, \\n“There aren’t any dogs barking.”\\n“No.”\\n“Doesn’t mean \\nanything, though.”\\n“. . . No.”\\nEragon paused. \\n“Someone should have seen us by now.”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Then why hasn’t \\nanyone come out?”\\nBrom squinted at \\nthe sun. “Could be afraid.”\\n“Could be,” said \\nEragon. He was quiet for a moment. “And if it’s a trap? The Ra’zac might be \\nwaiting for us.”\\n“We need \\nprovisions and water.”\\n“There’s the \\nNinor.”\\n“Still need \\nprovisions.”\\n“True.” Eragon \\nlooked around. “So we go in?”\\nBrom flicked his \\nreins. “Yes, but not like fools. This is the main entrance to Yazuac. If \\nthere’s an ambush, it’ll be along here. No one will expect us to arrive from a \\ndifferent direction.”\\n“Around to the \\nside, then?” asked Eragon. Brom nodded and pulled out his sword, resting the \\nbare blade across his saddle. Eragon strung his bow and nocked an arrow.\\nThey trotted \\nquietly around the town and entered it cautiously. The streets were empty, \\nexcept for a small fox that darted away as they came near. The houses were dark \\nand foreboding, with shattered windows. Many of the doors swung on broken \\nhinges. The horses rolled their eyes nervously. Eragon’s palm tingled, but he \\nresisted the urge to scratch it. As they rode into the center of town, he \\ngripped his bow tighter, blanching. “Gods above,” he whispered.\\nA mountain of \\nbodies rose above them, the corpses stiff and grimacing. Their clothes were \\nsoaked in blood, and the churned ground was stained with it. Slaughtered men \\nlay over the women they had tried to protect, mothers still clasped their \\nchildren, and lovers who had tried to shield each other rested in death’s cold \\nembrace. Black arrows stuck out of them all. Neither young nor old had been \\nspared. But worst of all was the barbed spear that rose out of the peak of the \\npile, impaling the white body of a baby.\\nTears blurred \\nEragon’s vision and he tried to look away, but the dead faces held his \\nattention. He stared at their open eyes and wondered how life could have left \\nthem so easily.What does our existence mean when it can end like this? A \\nwave of hopelessness overwhelmed him.\\nA crow dipped \\nout of the sky, like a black shadow, and perched on the spear. It cocked its \\nhead and greedily scrutinized the infant’s corpse. “Oh no you don’t,” snarled \\nEragon as he pulled back the bowstring and released it with a twang. With a \\npuff of feathers, the crow fell over backward, the arrow protruding from its \\nchest. Eragon fit another arrow to the string, but nausea rose from his stomach \\nand he threw up over Cadoc’s side.\\nBrom patted him \\non the back. When Eragon was done, Brom asked gently, “Do you want to wait for \\nme outside Yazuac?”\\n“No . . . I’ll \\nstay,” said Eragon shakily, wiping his mouth. He avoided looking at the \\ngruesome sight before them. “Who could have done . . .” He could not force out \\nthe words.\\nBrom bowed his \\nhead. “Those who love the pain and suffering of others. They wear many faces \\nand go by many disguises, but there is only one name for them: evil. There is \\nno understanding it. All we can do is pity and honor the victims.”\\nHe dismounted \\nSnowfire and walked around, inspecting the trampled ground carefully. “The \\nRa’zac passed this way,” he said slowly, “but this wasn’t their doing. This is \\nUrgal work; the spear is of their make. A company of them came through here, \\nperhaps as many as a hundred. It’s odd; I know of only a few instances when \\nthey have gathered in such . . .” He knelt and examined a footprint intently. \\nWith a curse he ran back to Snowfire and leapt onto him.\\n“Ride!” he \\nhissed tightly, spurring Snowfire forward. “There are still Urgals here!” \\nEragon jammed his heels into Cadoc. The horse jumped forward and raced after \\nSnowfire. They dashed past the houses and were almost to the edge of Yazuac \\nwhen Eragon’s palm tingled again. He saw a flicker of movement to his right, \\nthen a giant fist smashed him out of the saddle. He flew back over Cadoc and \\ncrashed into a wall, holding on to his bow only by instinct. Gasping and \\nstunned, he staggered upright, hugging his side.\\nAn Urgal stood \\nover him, face set in a gross leer. The monster was tall, thick, and broader \\nthan a doorway, with gray skin and yellow piggish eyes. Muscles bulged on his \\narms and chest, which was covered by a too small breastplate. An iron cap \\nrested over the pair of ram’s horns curling from his temples, and a roundshield \\nwas bound to one arm. His powerful hand held a short, wicked sword.\\nBehind him, \\nEragon saw Brom rein in Snowfire and start back, only to be stopped by the \\nappearance of a second Urgal, this one with an ax. “Run, you fool!” Brom cried \\nto Eragon, cleaving at his enemy. The Urgal in front of Eragon roared and swung \\nhis sword mightily. Eragon jerked back with a startled yelp as the weapon \\nwhistled past his cheek. He spun around and fled toward the center of Yazuac, \\nheart pounding wildly.\\nThe Urgal \\npursued him, heavy boots thudding. Eragon sent a desperate cry for help to \\nSaphira, then forced himself to go even faster. The Urgal rapidly gained ground \\ndespite Eragon’s efforts; large fangs separated in a soundless bellow. With the \\nUrgal almost upon him, Eragon strung an arrow, spun to a stop, took aim, and \\nreleased. The Urgal snapped up his arm and caught the quivering bolt on his \\nshield. The monster collided with Eragon before he could shoot again, and they \\nfell to the ground in a confused tangle.\\nEragon sprang to \\nhis feet and rushed back to Brom, who was trading fierce blows with his \\nopponent from Snowfire’s back.Where are the rest of the Urgals? wondered \\nEragon frantically.Are these two the only ones in Yazuac? There was a \\nloud smack, and Snowfire reared, whinnying. Brom doubled over in his saddle, \\nblood streaming down his arm. The Urgal beside him howled in triumph and raised \\nhis ax for the death blow.\\nA deafening \\nscream tore out of Eragon as he charged the Urgal, headfirst. The Urgal paused \\nin astonishment, then faced him contemptuously, swinging his ax. Eragon ducked \\nunder the two-handed blow and clawed the Urgal’s side, leaving bloody furrows. \\nThe Urgal’s face twisted with rage. He slashed again, but missed as Eragon \\ndived to the side and scrambled down an alley.\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on leading the Urgals away from Brom. He slipped into a narrow passageway \\nbetween two houses, saw it was a dead end, and slid to a stop. He tried to back \\nout, but the Urgals had already blocked the entrance. They advanced, cursing \\nhim in their gravelly voices. Eragon swung his head from side to side, \\nsearching for a way out, but there was none.\\nAs he faced the \\nUrgals, images flashed in his mind: dead villagers piled around the spear and \\nan innocent baby who would never grow to adulthood. At the thought of their \\nfate, a burning, fiery power gathered from every part of his body. It was more \\nthan a desire for justice. It was his entire being rebelling against the fact \\nof death—that he would cease to exist. The power grew stronger and stronger \\nuntil he felt ready to burst from the contained force.\\nHe stood tall \\nand straight, all fear gone. He raised his bow smoothly. The Urgals laughed and \\nlifted their shields. Eragon sighted down the shaft, as he had done hundreds of \\ntimes, and aligned the arrowhead with his target. The energy inside him burned \\nat an unbearable level. He had to release it, or it would consume him. A word \\nsuddenly leapt unbidden to his lips. He shot, yelling, “Brisingr!”\\nThe arrow hissed \\nthrough the air, glowing with a crackling blue light. It struck the lead Urgal \\non the forehead, and the air resounded with an explosion. A blue shock wave \\nblasted out of the monster’s head, killing the other Urgal instantly. It \\nreached Eragon before he had time to react, and it passed through him without \\nharm, dissipating against the houses.\\nEragon stood \\npanting, then looked at his icy palm. The gedwëy ignasia was glowing like \\nwhite-hot metal, yet even as he watched, it faded back to normal. He clenched \\nhis fist, then a wave of exhaustion washed over him. He felt strange and \\nfeeble, as if he had not eaten for days. His knees buckled, and he sagged \\nagainst a wall.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 24': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA DMONISHMENTS \\nOnce a modicum of \\nstrength returned to him, Eragon staggered out of the alley, skirting the dead \\nmonsters. He did not get far before Cadoc trotted to his side. “Good, you \\nweren’t hurt,” mumbled Eragon. He noticed, without particularly caring, that \\nhis hands were shaking violently and his movements were jerky. He felt \\ndetached, as if everything he saw were happening to someone else.\\nEragon found \\nSnowfire, nostrils flared and ears flat against his head, prancing by the \\ncorner of a house, ready to bolt. Brom was still slumped motionless in the \\nsaddle. Eragon reached out with his mind and soothed the horse. Once Snowfire \\nrelaxed, Eragon went to Brom.\\nThere was a \\nlong, blood-soaked cut on the old man’s right arm. The wound bled profusely, \\nbut it was neither deep nor wide. Still, Eragon knew it had to be bound before \\nBrom lost too much blood. He stroked Snowfire for a moment, then slid Brom out \\nof the saddle. The weight proved too much for him, and Brom dropped heavily to \\nthe ground. Eragon was shocked by his own weakness.\\nA scream of rage \\nfilled his head. Saphira dived out of the sky and landed fiercely in front of \\nhim, keeping her wings half raised. She hissed angrily, eyes burning. Her tail \\nlashed, and Eragon winced as it snapped overhead.Are you hurt? she \\nasked, rage boiling in her voice.\\n“No,” he assured \\nher as he laid Brom on his back.\\nShe growled and \\nexclaimed,Where are the ones who did this? I will tear them apart!\\nHe wearily \\npointed in the direction of the alley. “It’ll do no good; they’re already \\ndead.”\\nYou killed them?Saphira sounded \\nsurprised.\\nHe nodded. \\n“Somehow.” With a few terse words, he told her what had happened while he \\nsearched his saddlebags for the rags in which Zar’roc had been wrapped.\\nSaphira said \\ngravely,You have grown.\\nEragon grunted. \\nHe found a long rag and carefully rolled back Brom’s sleeve. With a few deft \\nstrokes he cleaned the cut and bandaged it tightly.I wish we were still in \\nPalancar Valley , he said to Saphira.There, at least, I knew what plants \\nwere good for healing. Here, I don’t have any idea what will help him. He \\nretrieved Brom’s sword from the ground, wiped it, then returned it to the \\nsheath on Brom’s belt.\\nWe should leave,said Saphira.There \\nmay be more Urgals lurking about.\\nCan you carry \\nBrom?Your saddle will hold him in place, and you can protect him. \\nYes, but I’m not \\nleaving you alone.\\n\\nFine, fly next \\nto me, but let’s get out of here.He tied the saddle onto Saphira, then \\nput his arms around Brom and tried to lift him, but again his diminished \\nstrength failed him.Saphira—help.\\nShe snaked her \\nhead past him and caught the back of Brom’s robe between her teeth. Arching her \\nneck, she lifted the old man off the ground, like a cat would a kitten, and \\ndeposited him onto her back. Then Eragon slipped Brom’s legs through the \\nsaddle’s straps and tightened them. He looked up when the old man moaned and \\nshifted.\\nBrom blinked \\nblearily, putting a hand to his head. He gazed down at Eragon with concern. \\n“Did Saphira get here in time?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “I’ll explain it later. Your arm is injured. I bandaged it as best I \\ncould, but you need a safe place to rest.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nBrom, gingerly touching his arm. “Do you know where my sword . . . Ah, I see \\nyou found it.”\\nEragon finished \\ntightening the straps. “Saphira’s going to take you and follow me by air.”\\n“Are you sure \\nyou want me to ride her?” asked Brom. “I can ride Snowfire.”\\n“Not with that \\narm. This way, even if you faint, you won’t fall off.”\\nBrom nodded. \\n“I’m honored.” He wrapped his good arm around Saphira’s neck, and she took off \\nin a flurry, springing high into the sky. Eragon backed away, buffeted by the \\neddies from her wings, and returned to the horses.\\nHe tied Snowfire \\nbehind Cadoc, then left Yazuac, returning to the trail and following it \\nsouthward. It led through a rocky area, veered left, and continued along the \\nbank of the Ninor River. Ferns, mosses, and small bushes dotted the side of the \\npath. It was refreshingly cool under the trees, but Eragon did not let the \\nsoothing air lull him into a sense of security. He stopped briefly to fill the \\nwaterskins and let the horses drink. Glancing down, he saw the Ra’zac’s spoor.At \\nleast we’re going in the right direction. Saphira circled overhead, keeping \\na keen eye on him.\\nIt disturbed him \\nthat they had seen only two Urgals. The villagers had been killed and Yazuac \\nransacked by a large horde, yet where was it?Perhaps the ones we encountered \\nwere a rear guard or a trap left for anyone who was following the main force.\\nHis thoughts \\nturned to how he had killed the Urgals. An idea, a revelation, slowly wormed \\nits way through his mind. He, Eragon—farm boy of Palancar Valley—had used \\nmagic.Magic! It was the only word for what had happened. It seemed \\nimpossible, but he could not deny what he had seen.Somehow I’ve become a \\nsorcerer or wizard! But he did not know how to use this new power again or \\nwhat its limits and dangers might be.How can I have this ability? Was it \\ncommon among the Riders? And if Brom knew of it, why didn’t he tell me? He \\nshook his head in wonder and bewilderment.\\nHe conversed \\nwith Saphira to check on Brom’s condition and to share his thoughts. She was \\njust as puzzled as he was about the magic.Saphira, can you find us a place \\nto stay? I can’t see very far down here. While she searched, he continued \\nalong the Ninor.\\nThe summons \\nreached him just as the light was fading.Come. Saphira sent him an image \\nof a secluded clearing in the trees by the river. Eragon turned the horses in \\nthe new direction and nudged them into a trot. With Saphira’s help it was easy \\nto find, but it was so well hidden that he doubted anyone else would notice it.\\nA small, \\nsmokeless fire was already burning when he entered the clearing. Brom sat next \\nto it, tending his arm, which he held at an awkward angle. Saphira was crouched \\nbeside him, her body tense. She looked intently at Eragon and asked,Are you \\nsure you aren’t hurt?\\nNot on the \\noutside . . . but I’m not sure about the rest of me. \\nI should have \\nbeen there sooner.\\n\\nDon’t feel bad. \\nWe all made mistakes today. Mine was not staying closer to you.Her gratitude \\nfor that remark washed over him. He looked at Brom. “How are you?”\\nThe old man \\nglanced at his arm. “It’s a large scratch and hurts terribly, but it should \\nheal quickly enough. I need a fresh bandage; this one didn’t last as long as \\nI’d hoped.” They boiled water to wash Brom’s wound. Then Brom tied a fresh rag \\nto his arm and said, “I must eat, and you look hungry as well. Let’s have \\ndinner first, then talk.”\\nWhen their \\nbellies were full and warm, Brom lit his pipe. “Now, I think it’s time for you \\nto tell me what transpired while I was unconscious. I am most curious.” His \\nface reflected the flickering firelight, and his bushy eyebrows stuck out \\nfiercely.\\nEragon nervously \\nclasped his hands and told the story without embellishment. Brom remained \\nsilent throughout it, his face inscrutable. When Eragon finished, Brom looked \\ndown at the ground. For a long time the only sound was the snapping fire. Brom \\nfinally stirred. “Have you used this power before?”\\n“No. Do you know \\nanything about it?”\\n“A little.” \\nBrom’s face was thoughtful. “It seems I owe you a debt for saving my life. I \\nhope I can return the favor someday. You should be proud; few escape unscathed \\nfrom slaying their first Urgal. But the manner in which you did it was very \\ndangerous. You could have destroyed yourself and the whole town.”\\n“It wasn’t as if \\nI had a choice,” said Eragon defensively. “The Urgals were almost upon me. If I \\nhad waited, they would have chopped me into pieces!”\\nBrom stamped his \\nteeth vigorously on the pipe stem. “You didn’t have any idea what you were \\ndoing.”\\n“Then tell me,” \\nchallenged Eragon. “I’ve been searching for answers to this mystery, but I \\ncan’t make sense of it. What happened? How could I have possibly used magic? No \\none has ever instructed me in it or taught me spells.”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nflashed. “This isn’t something you should be taught—much less use!”\\n“Well, Ihave \\nused it, and I may need it to fight again. But I won’t be able to if you don’t \\nhelp me. What’s wrong? Is there some secret I’m not supposed to learn until I’m \\nold and wise? Or maybe you don’t know anything about magic!”\\n“Boy!” roared \\nBrom. “You demand answers with an insolence rarely seen. If you knew what you \\nasked for, you would not be so quick to inquire. Do not try me.” He paused, \\nthen relaxed into a kinder countenance. “The knowledge you ask for is more \\ncomplex than you understand.”\\nEragon rose \\nhotly in protest. “I feel as though I’ve been thrust into a world with strange \\nrules that no one will explain.”\\n“I understand,” \\nsaid Brom. He fiddled with a piece of grass. “It’s late and we should sleep, \\nbut I will tell you a few things now, to stop your badgering. This magic—for it \\nis magic—has rules like the rest of the world. If you break the rules, the \\npenalty is death, without exception. Your deeds are limited by your strength, \\nthe words you know, and your imagination.”\\n“What do you \\nmean by words?” asked Eragon.\\n“More \\nquestions!” cried Brom. “For a moment I had hoped you were empty of them. But \\nyou are quite right in asking. When you shot the Urgals, didn’t you say \\nsomething?”\\n“Yes,brisingr. \\n” The fire flared, and a shiver ran through Eragon. Something about the word \\nmade him feel incredibly alive.\\n“I thought so.Brisingr \\nis from an ancient language that all living things used to speak. However, it \\nwas forgotten over time and went unspoken for eons in Alagaësia, until the \\nelves brought it back over the sea. They taught it to the other races, who used \\nit for making and doing powerful things. The language has a name for \\neverything, if you can find it.”\\n“But what does \\nthat have to do with magic?” interrupted Eragon.\\n“Everything! It \\nis the basis for all power. The language describes the true nature of things, \\nnot the superficial aspects that everyone sees. For example, fire is calledbrisingr \\n. Not only is thata name for fire, it isthe name for fire. If you \\nare strong enough, you can usebrisingr to direct fire to do whatever you \\nwill. And that is what happened today.”\\nEragon thought \\nabout it for a moment. “Why was the fire blue? How come it did exactly what I \\nwanted, if all I said wasfire ?”\\n“The color \\nvaries from person to person. It depends on who says the word. As to why the \\nfire did what you wanted, that’s a matter of practice. Most beginners have to \\nspell out exactly what they want to happen. As they gain more experience, it \\nisn’t as necessary. A true master could just saywater and create \\nsomething totally unrelated, like a gemstone. You wouldn’t be able to understand \\nhow he had done it, but the master would have seen the connection betweenwater \\nand the gem and would have used that as the focal point for his power. The \\npractice is more of an art than anything else. What you did was extremely \\ndifficult.”\\nSaphira interrupted \\nEragon’s thoughts.Brom is a magician! That’s how he was able to light the \\nfire on the plains. He doesn’t just know about magic; he can use it himself!\\nEragon’s eyes \\nwidened.You’re right!\\nAsk him about \\nthis power, but be careful of what you say. It is unwise to trifle with those \\nwho have such abilities. If he is a wizard or sorcerer, who knows what his \\nmotives might have been for settling in Carvahall? \\nEragon kept that \\nin mind as he said carefully, “Saphira and I just realized something. You can \\nuse this magic, can’t you? That’s how you started the fire our first day on the \\nplains.”\\nBrom inclined \\nhis head slightly. “I am proficient to some degree.”\\n“Then why didn’t \\nyou fight the Urgals with it? In fact, I can think of many times when it would \\nhave been useful—you could have shielded us from the storm and kept the dirt \\nout of our eyes.”\\nAfter refilling \\nhis pipe, Brom said, “Some simple reasons, really. I am not a Rider, which \\nmeans that, even at your weakest moment, you are stronger than I. And I have outlived \\nmy youth; I’m not as strong as I used to be. Every time I reach for magic, it \\ngets a little harder.”\\nEragon dropped \\nhis eyes, abashed. “I’m sorry.”\\n“Don’t be,” said \\nBrom as he shifted his arm. “It happens to everyone.”\\n“Where did you \\nlearn to use magic?”\\n“That is one \\nfact I’ll keep to myself. . . . Suffice it to say, it was in a remote area and \\nfrom a very good teacher. I can, at the very least, pass on his lessons.” Brom \\nsnuffed his pipe with a small rock. “I know that you have more questions, and I \\nwill answer them, but they must wait until morning.”\\nHe leaned \\nforward, eyes gleaming. “Until then, I will say this to discourage any \\nexperiments: magic takes just as much energy as if you used your arms and back. \\nThat is why you felt tired after destroying the Urgals. And that is why I was \\nangry. It was a dreadful risk on your part. If the magic had used more energy \\nthan was in your body, it would have killed you. You should use magic only for \\ntasks that can’t be accomplished the mundane way.”\\n“How do you know \\nif a spell will use all your energy?” asked Eragon, frightened.\\nBrom raised his \\nhands. “Most of the time you don’t. That’s why magicians have to know their \\nlimits well, and even then they are cautious. Once you commit to a task and \\nrelease the magic, you can’t pull it back, even if it’s going to kill you. I \\nmean this as a warning: don’t try anything until you’ve learned more. Now, \\nenough of this for tonight.”\\nAs they spread \\nout their blankets, Saphira commented with satisfaction,We are becoming more \\npowerful, Eragon, both of us. Soon no one will be able to stand in our way.\\nYes, but which \\nway shall we choose?\\n\\nWhichever one we \\nwant,she \\nsaid smugly, settling down for the night.\\nM AGICIS THE \\nSIMPLESTTHING\\n“Why do you think \\nthose two Urgals were still in Yazuac?” asked Eragon, after they had been on \\nthe trail for a while. “There doesn’t seem to be any reason for them to have \\nstayed behind.”\\n“I suspect they \\ndeserted the main group to loot the town. What makes it odd is that, as far as \\nI know, Urgals have gathered in force only two or three times in history. It’s \\nunsettling that they are doing it now.”\\n“Do you think \\nthe Ra’zac caused the attack?”\\n“I don’t know. \\nThe best thing we can do is continue away from Yazuac at the fastest pace we \\ncan muster. Besides, this is the direction the Ra’zac went: south.”\\nEragon agreed. \\n“We still need provisions, however. Is there another town nearby?”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, but Saphira can hunt for us if we must survive on meat alone. This \\nswath of trees may look small to you, but there are plenty of animals in it. \\nThe river is the only source of water for many miles around, so most of the \\nplains animals come here to drink. We won’t starve.”\\nEragon remained \\nquiet, satisfied with Brom’s answer. As they rode, loud birds darted around \\nthem, and the river rushed by peacefully. It was a noisy place, full of life \\nand energy. Eragon asked, “How did that Urgal get you? Things were happening so \\nfast, I didn’t see.”\\n“Bad luck, \\nreally,” grumbled Brom. “I was more than a match for him, so he kicked \\nSnowfire. The idiot of a horse reared and threw me off balance. That was all \\nthe Urgal needed to give me this gash.” He scratched his chin. “I suppose \\nyou’re still wondering about this magic. The fact that you’ve discovered it \\npresents a thorny problem. Few know it, but every Rider could use magic, though \\nwith differing strengths. They kept the ability secret, even at the height of \\ntheir power, because it gave them an advantage over their enemies. Had everyone \\nknown about it, dealing with common people would have been difficult. Many \\nthink the king’s magical powers come from the fact that he is a wizard or \\nsorcerer. That’s not true; it is because he’s a Rider.”\\n“What’s the \\ndifference? Doesn’t the fact that I used magic make me a sorcerer?”\\n“Not at all! A \\nsorcerer, like a Shade, uses spirits to accomplish his will. That is totally \\ndifferent from your power. Nor does that make you a magician, whose powers come \\nwithout the aid of spirits or a dragon. And you’re certainly not a witch or \\nwizard, who get their powers from various potions and spells.\\n“Which brings me \\nback to my original point: the problem you’ve presented. Young Riders like \\nyourself were put through a strict regimen designed to strengthen their bodies \\nand increase their mental control. This regimen continued for many months, \\noccasionally years, until the Riders were deemed responsible enough to handle \\nmagic. Up until then, not one student was told of his potential powers. If one \\nof them discovered magic by accident, he or she was immediately taken away for \\nprivate tutoring. It was rare for anyone to discover magic on his own,” he \\ninclined his head toward Eragon, “though they were never put under the same \\npressure you were.”\\n“Then how were \\nthey finally trained to use magic?” asked Eragon. “I don’t see how you could \\nteach it to anyone. If you had tried to explain it to me two days ago, it \\nwouldn’t have made any sense.”\\n“The students \\nwere presented with a series of pointless exercises designed to frustrate them. \\nFor example, they were instructed to move piles of stones using only their \\nfeet, fill ever draining tubs full of water, and other impossibilities. After a \\ntime, they would get infuriated enough to use magic. Most of the time it \\nsucceeded.\\n“What this \\nmeans,” Brom continued, “is that you will be disadvantaged if you ever meet an \\nenemy who has received this training. There are still some alive who are that \\nold: the king for one, not to mention the elves. Any one of those could tear \\nyou apart with ease.”\\n“What can I do, \\nthen?”\\n“There isn’t \\ntime for formal instruction, but we can do much while we travel,” said Brom. “I \\nknow many techniques you can practice that will give you strength and control, \\nbut you cannot gain the discipline the Riders had overnight. You,” he looked at \\nEragon humorously, “will have to amass it on the run. It will be hard in the \\nbeginning, but the rewards will be great. It may please you to know that no \\nRider your age ever used magic the way you did yesterday with those two Urgals.”\\nEragon smiled at \\nthe praise. “Thank you. Does this language have a name?”\\nBrom laughed. \\n“Yes, but no one knows it. It would be a word of incredible power, something by \\nwhich you could control the entire language and those who use it. People have \\nlong searched for it, but no one has ever found it.”\\n“I still don’t \\nunderstand how this magic works,” said Eragon. “Exactly how do I use it?”\\nBrom looked \\nastonished. “I haven’t made that clear?”\\n“No.”\\nBrom took a deep \\nbreath and said, “To work with magic, you must have a certain innate power, \\nwhich is very rare among people nowadays. You also have to be able to summon \\nthis power at will. Once it is called upon, you have to use it or let it fade \\naway. Understood? Now, if you wish to employ the power, you must utter the word \\nor phrase of the ancient language that describes your intent. For example, if \\nyou hadn’t saidbrisingr yesterday, nothing would have happened.”\\n“So I’m limited \\nby my knowledge of this language?”\\n“Exactly,” \\ncrowed Brom. “Also, while speaking it, it’s impossible to practice deceit.”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead. “That can’t be. People always lie. The sounds of the ancient words can’t \\nstop them from doing that.”\\nBrom cocked an \\neyebrow and said, “Fethrblaka, eka weohnata néiat haina ono. Blaka eom iet \\nlam.” A bird suddenly flitted from a branch and landed on his hand. It trilled \\nlightly and looked at them with beady eyes. After a moment he said, “Eitha,” \\nand it fluttered away.\\n“How did you do \\nthat?” asked Eragon in wonder.\\n“I promised not \\nto harm him. He may not have known exactly what I meant, but in the language of \\npower, the meaning of my words was evident. The bird trusted me because he \\nknows what all animals do, that those who speak in that tongue are bound by \\ntheir word.”\\n“And the elves \\nspeak this language?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“So they never \\nlie?”\\n“Not quite,” \\nadmitted Brom. “They maintain that they don’t, and in a way it’s true, but they \\nhave perfected the art of saying one thing and meaning another. You never know \\nexactly what their intent is, or if you have fathomed it correctly. Many times \\nthey only reveal part of the truth and withhold the rest. It takes a refined \\nand subtle mind to deal with their culture.”\\nEragon \\nconsidered that. “What do personal names mean in this language? Do they give \\npower over people?”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nbrightened with approval. “Yes, they do. Those who speak the language have two \\nnames. The first is for everyday use and has little authority. But the second \\nis their true name and is shared with only a few trusted people. There was a time \\nwhen no one concealed his true name, but this age isn’t as kind. Whoever knows \\nyour true name gains enormous power over you. It’s like putting your life into \\nanother person’s hands. Everyone has a hidden name, but few know what it is.”\\n“How do you find \\nyour true name?” asked Eragon.\\n“Elves \\ninstinctively know theirs. No one else has that gift. The human Riders usually \\nwent on quests to discover it—or found an elf who would tell them, which was \\nrare, for elves don’t distribute that knowledge freely,” replied Brom.\\n“I’d like to \\nknow mine,” Eragon said wistfully.\\nBrom’s brow \\ndarkened. “Be careful. It can be a terrible knowledge. To know who you are \\nwithout any delusions or sympathy is a moment of revelation that no one \\nexperiences unscathed. Some have been driven to madness by that stark reality. \\nMost try to forget it. But as much as the name will give others power, so you \\nmay gain power over yourself, if the truth doesn’t break you.”\\nAnd I’m sure \\nthat it would not,stated \\nSaphira.\\n“I still wish to \\nknow,” said Eragon, determined.\\n“You are not \\neasily dissuaded. That is good, for only the resolute find their identity, but \\nI cannot help you with this. It is a search that you will have to undertake on \\nyour own.” Brom moved his injured arm and grimaced uncomfortably.\\n“Why can’t you \\nor I heal that with magic?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom blinked. \\n“No reason—I just never considered it because it’s beyond my strength. You \\ncould probably do it with the right word, but I don’t want you to exhaust \\nyourself.”\\n“I could save \\nyou a lot of trouble and pain,” protested Eragon.\\n“I’ll live with \\nit,” said Brom flatly. “Using magic to heal a wound takes just as much energy \\nas it would to mend on its own. I don’t want you tired for the next few days. \\nYou shouldn’t attempt such a difficult task yet.”\\n“Still, if it’s \\npossible to fix your arm, could I bring someone back from the dead?”\\nThe question \\nsurprised Brom, but he answered quickly, “Remember what I said about projects \\nthat will kill you? That is one of them. Riders were forbidden to try to resurrect \\nthe dead, for their own safety. There is an abyss beyond life where magic means \\nnothing. If you reach into it, your strength will flee and your soul will fade \\ninto darkness. Wizards, sorcerers, and Riders—all have failed and died on that \\nthreshold. Stick with what’s possible—cuts, bruises, maybe some broken \\nbones—but definitely not dead people.”\\nEragon frowned. \\n“This is a lot more complex than I thought.”\\n“Exactly!” said \\nBrom. “And if you don’t understand what you’re doing, you’ll try something too \\nbig and die.” He twisted in his saddle and swooped down, grabbing a handful of \\npebbles from the ground. With effort, he righted himself, then discarded all \\nbut one of the rocks. “See this pebble?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Take it.” \\nEragon did and stared at the unremarkable lump. It was dull black, smooth, and \\nas large as the end of his thumb. There were countless stones like it on the \\ntrail. “This is your training.”\\nEragon looked \\nback at him, confused. “I don’t understand.”\\n“Of course you \\ndon’t,” said Brom impatiently. “That’s why I’m teaching you and not the other \\nway around. Now stop talking or we’ll never get anywhere. What I want you to do \\nis lift the rock off your palm and hold it in the air for as long as you can. \\nThe words you’re going to use arestenr reisa . Say them.”\\n“Stenr reisa.”\\n“Good. Go ahead \\nand try.”\\nEragon focused \\nsourly on the pebble, searching his mind for any hint of the energy that had \\nburned in him the day before. The stone remained motionless as he stared at it, \\nsweating and frustrated.How am I supposed to do this? Finally, he \\ncrossed his arms and snapped, “This is impossible.”\\n“No,” said Brom \\ngruffly. “I’llsay when it’s impossible or not. Fight for it! Don’t give \\nin this easily. Try again.”\\nFrowning, Eragon \\nclosed his eyes, setting aside all distracting thoughts. He took a deep breath \\nand reached into the farthest corners of his consciousness, trying to find \\nwhere his power resided. Searching, he found only thoughts and memories until \\nhe felt something different—a small bump that was a part of him and yet not of \\nhim. Excited, he dug into it, seeking what it hid. He felt resistance, a \\nbarrier in his mind, but knew that the power lay on the other side. He tried to \\nbreach it, but it held firm before his efforts. Growing angry, Eragon drove \\ninto the barrier, ramming against it with all of his might until it shattered \\nlike a thin pane of glass, flooding his mind with a river of light.\\n“Stenr reisa,” \\nhe gasped. The pebble wobbled into the air over his faintly glowing palm. He \\nstruggled to keep it floating, but the power slipped away and faded back behind \\nthe barrier. The pebble dropped to his hand with a soft plop, and his palm \\nreturned to normal. He felt a little tired, but grinned from his success.\\n“Not bad for \\nyour first time,” said Brom.\\n“Why does my \\nhand do that? It’s like a little lantern.”\\n“No one’s sure,” \\nBrom admitted. “The Riders always preferred to channel their power through \\nwhichever hand bore the gedwëy ignasia. You can use your other palm, but it \\nisn’t as easy.” He looked at Eragon for a minute. “I’ll buy you some gloves at \\nthe next town, if it isn’t gutted. You hide the mark pretty well on your own, \\nbut we don’t want anyone to see it by accident. Besides, there may be times \\nwhen you won’t want the glow to alert an enemy.”\\n“Do you have a \\nmark of your own?”\\n“No. Only Riders \\nhave them,” said Brom. “Also, you should know that magic is affected by \\ndistance, just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move something a \\nmile away, it’ll take more energy than if you were closer. So if you see \\nenemies racing after you from a league away, let them approach before using \\nmagic. Now, back to work! Try to lift the pebble again.”\\n“Again?” asked \\nEragon weakly, thinking of the effort it had taken to do it just once.\\n“Yes! And this \\ntime be quicker about it.”\\nThey continued \\nwith the exercises throughout most of the day. When Eragon finally stopped, he \\nwas tired and ill-tempered. In those hours, he had come to hate the pebble and \\neverything about it. He started to throw it away, but Brom said, “Don’t. Keep \\nit.” Eragon glared at him, then reluctantly tucked the stone into a pocket.\\n“We’re not done \\nyet,” warned Brom, “so don’t get comfortable.” He pointed at a small plant. \\n“This is calleddelois .” From there on he instructed Eragon in the \\nancient language, giving him words to memorize, fromvöndr, a thin, \\nstraight stick, to the morning star,Aiedail .\\nThat evening \\nthey sparred around the fire. Though Brom fought with his left hand, his skill \\nwas undiminished.\\n\\xa0\\nThe days \\nfollowed the same pattern. First, Eragon struggled to learn the ancient words \\nand to manipulate the pebble. Then, in the evening, he trained against Brom \\nwith the fake swords. Eragon was in constant discomfort, but he gradually began \\nto change, almost without noticing. Soon the pebble no longer wobbled when he \\nlifted it. He mastered the first exercises Brom gave him and undertook harder \\nones, and his knowledge of the ancient language grew.\\nIn their \\nsparring, Eragon gained confidence and speed, striking like a snake. His blows \\nbecame heavier, and his arm no longer trembled when he warded off attacks. The \\nclashes lasted longer as he learned how to fend off Brom. Now, when they went \\nto sleep, Eragon was not the only one with bruises.\\nSaphira \\ncontinued to grow as well, but more slowly than before. Her extended flights, \\nalong with periodic hunts, kept her fit and healthy. She was taller than the \\nhorses now, and much longer. Because of her size and the way her scales \\nsparkled, she was altogether too visible. Brom and Eragon worried about it, but \\nthey could not convince her to allow dirt to obscure her scintillating hide.\\nThey continued \\nsouth, tracking the Ra’zac. It frustrated Eragon that no matter how fast they \\nwent, the Ra’zac always stayed a few days ahead of them. At times he was ready \\nto give up, but then they would find some mark or print that would renew his \\nhope.\\nThere were no \\nsigns of habitation along the Ninor or in the plains, leaving the three \\ncompanions undisturbed as the days slipped by. Finally, they neared Daret, the \\nfirst village since Yazuac.\\n\\xa0\\nThe night before \\nthey reached the village, Eragon’s dreams were especially vivid.\\nHe saw Garrow \\nand Roran at home, sitting in the destroyed kitchen. They asked him for help \\nrebuilding the farm, but he only shook his head with a pang of longing in his \\nheart. “I’m tracking your killers,” he whispered to his uncle. \\nGarrow looked at \\nhim askance and demanded, “Do I look dead to you?” \\n“I can’t help \\nyou,” said Eragon softly, feeling tears in his eyes. \\nThere was a \\nsudden roar, and Garrow transformed into the Ra’zac. “Then die,” they hissed, \\nand leapt at Eragon.\\n\\nHe woke up \\nfeeling ill and watched the stars slowly turn in the sky.\\nAll will be \\nwell, little one,said \\nSaphira gently.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 25': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD ARET \\nDaret was on the \\nbanks of the Ninor River—as it had to be to survive. The village was small and \\nwild-looking, without any signs of inhabitants. Eragon and Brom approached it \\nwith great caution. Saphira hid close to the town this time; if trouble arose, \\nshe would be at their sides within seconds.\\nThey rode into \\nDaret, striving to be silent. Brom gripped his sword with his good hand, eyes \\nflashing everywhere. Eragon kept his bow partially drawn as they passed between \\nthe silent houses, glancing at each other with apprehension.This doesn’t \\nlook good, commented Eragon to Saphira. She did not answer, but he felt her \\nprepare to rush after them. He looked at the ground and was reassured to see \\nthe fresh footprints of children.But where are they?\\nBrom stiffened \\nas they entered the center of Daret and found it empty. Wind blew through the \\ndesolate town, and dust devils swirled sporadically. Brom wheeled Snowfire \\nabout. “Let’s get out of here. I don’t like the feel of this.” He spurred \\nSnowfire into a gallop. Eragon followed him, urging Cadoc onward.\\nThey advanced \\nonly a few strides before wagons toppled out from behind the houses and blocked \\ntheir way. Cadoc snorted and dug in his hooves, sliding to a stop next to \\nSnowfire. A swarthy man hopped over the wagon and planted himself before them, \\na broadsword slung at his side and a drawn bow in his hands. Eragon swung his \\nown bow up and pointed it at the stranger, who commanded, “Halt! Put your \\nweapons down. You’re surrounded by sixty archers. They’ll shoot if you move.” \\nAs if on cue, a row of men stood up on the roofs of the surrounding houses.\\nStay away, \\nSaphira!cried \\nEragon.There are too many. If you come, they’ll shoot you out of the sky. \\nStay away! She heard, but he was unsure if she would obey. He prepared to \\nuse magic.I’ll have to stop the arrows before they hit me or Brom.\\n“What do you \\nwant?” asked Brom calmly.\\n“Why have you \\ncome here?” demanded the man.\\n“To buy supplies \\nand hear the news. Nothing more. We’re on the way to my cousin’s house in \\nDras-Leona.”\\n“You’re armed \\npretty heavily.”\\n“So are you,” \\nsaid Brom. “These are dangerous times.”\\n“True.” The man \\nlooked at them carefully. “I don’t think you mean us ill, but we’ve had too \\nmany encounters with Urgals and bandits for me to trust you only on your word.”\\n“If it doesn’t \\nmatter what we say, what happens now?” countered Brom. The men on top of the \\nhouses had not moved. By their very stillness, Eragon was sure that they were \\neither highly disciplined . . . or frightened for their lives. He hoped it was \\nthe latter.\\n“You say that \\nyou only want supplies. Would you agree to stay here while we bring what you \\nneed, then pay us and leave immediately?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“All right,” \\nsaid the man, lowering his bow, though he kept it ready. He waved at one of the \\narchers, who slid to the ground and ran over. “Tell him what you want.”\\nBrom recited a \\nshort list and then added, “Also, if you have a spare pair of gloves that would \\nfit my nephew, I’d like to buy those too.” The archer nodded and ran off.\\n“The name’s \\nTrevor,” said the man standing in front of them. “Normally I’d shake your hand, \\nbut under the circumstances, I think I’ll keep my distance. Tell me, where are \\nyou from?”\\n“North,” said \\nBrom, “but we haven’t lived in any place long enough to call it home. Have \\nUrgals forced you to take these measures?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nTrevor, “and worse fiends. Do you have any news from other towns? We receive \\nword from them rarely, but there have been reports that they are also \\nbeleaguered.”\\nBrom turned \\ngrave. “I wish it wasn’t our lot to bring you these tidings. Nearly a fortnight \\nago we passed through Yazuac and found it pillaged. The villagers had been \\nslaughtered and piled together. We would have tried to give them a decent \\nburial, but two Urgals attacked us.”\\nShocked, Trevor \\nstepped back and looked down with tears in his eyes. “Alas, this is indeed a \\ndark day. Still, I don’t see how two Urgals could have defeated all of Yazuac. \\nThe people there were good fighters—some were my friends.”\\n“There were \\nsigns that a band of Urgals had ravaged the town,” stated Brom. “I think the \\nones we encountered were deserters.”\\n“How large was \\nthe company?”\\nBrom fiddled \\nwith his saddlebags for a minute. “Large enough to wipe out Yazuac, but small \\nenough to go unnoticed in the countryside. No more than a hundred, and no less \\nthan fifty. If I’m not mistaken, either number would prove fatal to you.” \\nTrevor wearily agreed. “You should consider leaving,” Brom continued. “This \\narea has become far too perilous for anyone to live in peace.”\\n“I know, but the \\npeople here refuse to consider moving. This is their home—as well as mine, \\nthough I have only been here a couple years—and they place its worth above \\ntheir own lives.” Trevor looked at him seriously. “We have repulsed individual \\nUrgals, and that has given the townspeople a confidence far beyond their \\nabilities. I fear that we will all wake up one morning with our throats \\nslashed.”\\nThe archer \\nhurried out of a house with a pile of goods in his arms. He set them next to \\nthe horses, and Brom paid him. As the man left, Brom asked, “Why did they \\nchoose you to defend Daret?”\\nTrevor shrugged. \\n“I was in the king’s army for some years.”\\nBrom dug through \\nthe items, handed Eragon the pair of gloves, and packed the rest of the \\nsupplies into their saddlebags. Eragon pulled the gloves on, being careful to \\nkeep his palm facing down, and flexed his hands. The leather felt good and \\nstrong, though it was scarred from use. “Well,” said Brom, “as I promised, we \\nwill go now.”\\nTrevor nodded. \\n“When you enter Dras-Leona, would you do us this favor? Alert the Empire to our \\nplight and that of the other towns. If word of this hasn’t reached the king by \\nnow, it’s cause for worry. And if it has, but he has chosen to do nothing, that \\ntoo is cause for worry.”\\n“We will carry \\nyour message. May your swords stay sharp,” said Brom.\\n“And yours.”\\nThe wagons were \\npulled out of their way, and they rode from Daret into the trees along the \\nNinor River. Eragon sent his thoughts to Saphira.We’re on our way back. \\nEverything turned out all right. Her only response was simmering anger.\\nBrom pulled at \\nhis beard. “The Empire is in worse condition than I had imagined. When the \\ntraders visited Carvahall, they brought reports of unrest, but I never believed \\nthat it was this widespread. With all these Urgals around, it seems that the \\nEmpire itself is under attack, yet no troops or soldiers have been sent out. \\nIt’s as if the king doesn’t care to defend his domain.”\\n“It is strange,” \\nagreed Eragon.\\nBrom ducked \\nunder a low-hanging branch. “Did you use any of your powers while we were in \\nDaret?”\\n“There was no \\nreason to.”\\n“Wrong,” \\ncorrected Brom. “You could have sensed Trevor’s intentions. Even with my \\nlimited abilities, I was able to do that. If the villagers had been bent on \\nkilling us, I wouldn’t have just sat there. However, I felt there was a \\nreasonable chance of talking our way out of there, which is what I did.”\\n“How could I \\nknow what Trevor was thinking?” asked Eragon. “Am I supposed to be able to see \\ninto people’s minds?”\\n“Come now,” \\nchided Brom, “you should know the answer to that. You could have discovered \\nTrevor’s purpose in the same way that you communicate with Cadoc or Saphira. \\nThe minds of men are not so different from a dragon’s or horse’s. It’s a simple \\nthing to do, but it’s a power you must use sparingly and with great caution. A \\nperson’s mind is his last sanctuary. You must never violate it unless \\ncircumstances force you to. The Riders had very strict rules regarding this. If \\nthey were broken without due cause, the punishment was severe.”\\n“And you can do \\nthis even though you aren’t a Rider?” asked Eragon.\\n“As I said \\nbefore, with the right instruction anyone can talk with their minds, but with \\ndiffering amounts of success. Whether it’s magic, though, is hard to tell. \\nMagical abilities will certainly trigger the talent—or becoming linked with a \\ndragon—but I’ve known plenty who learned it on their own. Think about it: you \\ncan communicate with any sentient being, though the contact may not be very \\nclear. You could spend the entire day listening to a bird’s thoughts or \\nunderstanding how an earthworm feels during a rainstorm. But I’ve never found \\nbirds very interesting. I suggest starting with a cat; they have unusual \\npersonalities.”\\nEragon twisted \\nCadoc’s reins in his hands, considering the implications of what Brom had said. \\n“But if I can get into someone’s head, doesn’t that mean that others can do the \\nsame to me? How do I know if someone’s prying in my mind? Is there a way to \\nstop that?”How do I know if Brom can tell what I’m thinking right now?\\n“Why, yes. \\nHasn’t Saphira ever blocked you from her mind?”\\n“Occasionally,” \\nadmitted Eragon. “When she took me into the Spine, I couldn’t talk to her at \\nall. It wasn’t that she was ignoring me; I don’t think she could even hear me. \\nThere were walls around her mind that I couldn’t get through.”\\nBrom worked on \\nhis bandage for a moment, shifting it higher on his arm. “Only a few people can \\ntell if someone is in their mind, and of those, only a handful could stop you \\nfrom entering. It’s a matter of training and of how you think. Because of your \\nmagical power, you’ll always know if someone is in your mind. Once you do, \\nblocking them is a simple matter of concentrating on one thing to the exclusion \\nof all else. For instance, if you only think about a brick wall, that’s all the \\nenemy will find in your mind. However, it takes a huge amount of energy and \\ndiscipline to block someone for any length of time. If you’re distracted by \\neven the slightest thing, your wall will waver and your opponent will slip in \\nthrough the weakness.”\\n“How can I learn \\nto do this?” asked Eragon.\\n“There is only \\none thing for it: practice, practice, and yet more practice. Picture something \\nin your mind and hold it there to the exclusion of all else for as long as you \\ncan. It is a very advanced ability; only a handful ever master it,” said Brom.\\n“I don’t need \\nperfection, just safety.”If I can get into someone’s mind, can I change how \\nhe thinks? Every time I learn something new about magic, I grow more wary of \\nit.\\nWhen they \\nreached Saphira, she startled them by thrusting her head at them. The horses \\nbackstepped nervously. Saphira looked Eragon over carefully and gave a low \\nhiss. Her eyes were flinty. Eragon threw a concerned look at Brom—he had never \\nseen Saphira this angry—then asked,What’s wrong?\\nYou,she growled.You \\nare the problem.\\nEragon frowned \\nand got off Cadoc. As soon as his feet touched the ground, Saphira swept his \\nlegs out from under him with her tail and pinned him with her talons. “What are \\nyou doing?” he yelled, struggling to get up, but she was too strong for him. \\nBrom watched attentively from Snowfire.\\nSaphira swung \\nher head over Eragon until they were eye to eye. He squirmed under her \\nunwavering glare.You! Every time you leave my sight you get into trouble. \\nYou’re like a new hatchling, sticking your nose into everything. And what happens \\nwhen you stick it into something that bites back? How will you survive then? I \\ncannot help you when I’m miles away. I’ve stayed hidden so that no one would \\nsee me, but no longer! Not when it may cost you your life.\\nI can understand \\nwhy you’re upset,said \\nEragon,but I’m much older than you and can take care of myself. If anything, \\nyou’re the one who needs to be protected.\\nShe snarled and \\nsnapped her teeth by his ear.Do you really believe that? she asked.Tomorrow \\nyou will ride me—not that pitiful deer-animal you call a horse—or else I will \\ncarry you in my claws. Are you a Dragon Rider or not? Don’t you care for me?\\nThe question \\nburned in Eragon, and he dropped his gaze. He knew she was right, but he was \\nscared of riding her. Their flights had been the most painful ordeal he had \\never endured.\\n“Well?” demanded \\nBrom.\\n“She wants me to \\nride her tomorrow,” said Eragon lamely.\\nBrom considered \\nit with twinkling eyes. “Well, you have the saddle. I suppose that if the two \\nof you stay out of sight, it won’t be a problem.” Saphira switched her gaze to \\nhim, then returned it to Eragon.\\n“But what if \\nyou’re attacked or there’s an accident? I won’t be able to get there in time \\nand—”\\nSaphira pressed \\nharder on his chest, stopping his words.Exactly my point, little one.\\nBrom seemed to \\nhide a smile. “It’s worth the risk. You need to learn how to ride her anyway. \\nThink about it this way: with you flying ahead and looking at the ground, \\nyou’ll be able to spot any traps, ambushes, or other unwelcome surprises.”\\nEragon looked \\nback at Saphira and said,Okay, I’ll do it. But let me up.\\nGive me your \\nword.\\n\\nIs that really \\nnecessary?he \\ndemanded. She blinked.Very well. I give you my word that I will fly with you \\ntomorrow. Satisfied?\\nI am content. \\nSaphira let him \\nup and, with a push of her legs, took off. A small shiver ran through Eragon as \\nhe watched her twist through the air. Grumbling, he returned to Cadoc and \\nfollowed Brom.\\nIt was nearly \\nsundown when they made camp. As usual, Eragon dueled with Brom before dinner. \\nIn the midst of the fight, Eragon delivered such a powerful blow that he \\nsnapped both of their sticks like twigs. The pieces whistled into the darkness \\nin a cloud of splintered fragments. Brom tossed what remained of his stick into \\nthe fire and said, “We’re done with these; throw yours in as well. You have \\nlearned well, but we’ve gone as far as we can with branches. There is nothing \\nmore you can gain from them. It is time for you to use the blade.” He removed \\nZar’roc from Eragon’s bag and gave it to him.\\n“We’ll cut each \\nother to ribbons,” protested Eragon.\\n“Not so. Again \\nyou forget magic,” said Brom. He held up his sword and turned it so that \\nfirelight glinted off the edge. He put a finger on either side of the blade and \\nfocused intensely, deepening the lines on his forehead. For a moment nothing \\nhappened, then he uttered, “Gëuloth du knífr!” and a small red spark jumped \\nbetween his fingers. As it flickered back and forth, he ran his fingers down \\nthe length of the sword. Then he twirled it and did the same thing on the other \\nside. The spark vanished the moment his fingers left the metal.\\nBrom held his \\nhand out, palm up, and slashed it with the sword. Eragon jumped forward but was \\ntoo slow to stop him. He was astonished when Brom raised his unharmed hand with \\na smile. “What did you do?” asked Eragon.\\n“Feel the edge,” \\nsaid Brom. Eragon touched it and felt an invisible surface under his fingers. \\nThe barrier was about a quarter inch wide and very slippery. “Now do the same \\non Zar’roc,” instructed Brom. “Your block will be a bit different than mine, \\nbut it should accomplish the same thing.”\\nHe told Eragon \\nhow to pronounce the words and coached him through the process. It took Eragon \\na few tries, but he soon had Zar’roc’s edge protected. Confident, he took his \\nfighting stance. Before they started, Brom admonished, “These swords won’t cut \\nus, but they can still break bones. I would prefer to avoid that, so don’t \\nflail around like you normally do. A blow to the neck could prove fatal.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nthen struck without warning. Sparks flew off his blade, and the clash of metal \\nfilled their campsite as Brom parried. The sword felt slow and heavy to Eragon \\nafter fighting with sticks for so long. Unable to move Zar’roc fast enough, he \\nreceived a sharp rap on his knee.\\nThey both had \\nlarge welts when they stopped, Eragon more so than Brom. He marveled that \\nZar’roc had not been scratched or dented by the vigorous pounding it had \\nreceived.\\nT HROUGH \\nA  \\nDRAGON’SEYE\\nThe next morning \\nEragon woke with stiff limbs and purple bruises. He saw Brom carry the saddle \\nto Saphira and tried to quell his uneasiness. By the time breakfast was ready, \\nBrom had strapped the saddle onto Saphira and hung Eragon’s bags from it.\\nWhen his bowl \\nwas empty, Eragon silently picked up his bow and went to Saphira. Brom said, \\n“Now remember, grip with your knees, guide her with your thoughts, and stay as \\nflat as you can on her back. Nothing will go wrong if you don’t panic.” Eragon \\nnodded, sliding his unstrung bow into its leather tube, and Brom boosted him \\ninto the saddle.\\nSaphira waited \\nimpatiently while Eragon tightened the bands around his legs.Are you ready? \\nshe asked.\\nHe sucked in the \\nfresh morning air.No, but let’s do it! She agreed enthusiastically. He \\nbraced himself as she crouched. Her powerful legs surged and the air whipped \\npast him, snatching his breath away. With three smooth strokes of her wings, \\nshe was in the sky, climbing rapidly.\\nThe last time \\nEragon had ridden Saphira, every flap of her wings had been strained. Now she \\nflew steadily and effortlessly. He clenched his arms around her neck as she \\nturned on edge, banking. The river shrank to a wispy gray line beneath them. \\nClouds floated around them.\\nWhen they \\nleveled off high above the plains, the trees below were no more than specks. \\nThe air was thin, chilly, and perfectly clear. “This is wonderfu—” His words \\nwere lost as Saphira tilted and rolled completely around. The ground spun in a \\ndizzying circle, and vertigo clutched Eragon. “Don’t do that!” he cried. “I \\nfeel like I’m going to fall off.”\\nYou must become \\naccustomed to it. If I’m attacked in the air, that’s one of the simplest \\nmaneuvers I will do,she \\nreplied. He could think of no rebuttal, so he concentrated on controlling his \\nstomach. Saphira angled into a shallow dive and slowly approached the ground.\\nAlthough \\nEragon’s stomach lurched with every wobble, he began to enjoy himself. He \\nrelaxed his arms a bit and stretched his neck back, taking in the scenery. \\nSaphira let him enjoy the sights awhile, then said,Let me show you what \\nflying is really like.\\nHow?he asked.\\nRelax and do not \\nbe afraid,she \\nsaid.\\nHer mind tugged \\nat his, pulling him away from his body. Eragon fought for a moment, then \\nsurrendered control. His vision blurred, and he found himself looking through \\nSaphira’s eyes. Everything was distorted: colors had weird, exotic tints; blues \\nwere more prominent now, while greens and reds were subdued. Eragon tried to \\nturn his head and body but could not. He felt like a ghost who had slipped out \\nof the ether.\\nPure joy \\nradiated from Saphira as she climbed into the sky. She loved this freedom to go \\nanywhere. When they were high above the ground, she looked back at Eragon. He \\nsaw himself as she did, hanging on to her with a blank look. He could feel her \\nbody strain against the air, using updrafts to rise. All her muscles were like \\nhis own. He felt her tail swinging through the air like a giant rudder to \\ncorrect her course. It surprised him how much she depended on it.\\nTheir connection \\ngrew stronger until there was no distinction between their identities. They \\nclasped their wings together and dived straight down, like a spear thrown from \\non high. No terror of falling touched Eragon, engulfed as he was in Saphira’s \\nexhilaration. The air rushed past their face. Their tail whipped in the air, \\nand their joined minds reveled in the experience.\\nEven as they \\nplummeted toward the ground, there was no fear of collision. They snapped open \\ntheir wings at just the right moment, pulling out of the dive with their \\ncombined strength. Slanting toward the sky, they shot up and continued back \\nover into a giant loop.\\nAs they leveled \\nout, their minds began to diverge, becoming distinct personalities again. For a \\nsplit second, Eragon felt both his body and Saphira’s. Then his vision blurred \\nand he again sat on her back. He gasped and collapsed on the saddle. It was \\nminutes before his heart stopped hammering and his breathing calmed. Once he \\nhad recovered, he exclaimed,That was incredible! How can you bear to land \\nwhen you enjoy flying so much?\\nI must eat,she said with \\nsome amusement.But I am glad that you took pleasure in it.\\nThose are spare \\nwords for such an experience. I’m sorry I haven’t flown with you more; I never \\nthought it could be like that. Do you always see so much blue? \\nIt is the way I \\nam. We will fly together more often now? \\nYes! Every \\nchance we get.\\n\\nGood,she replied in a \\ncontented tone.\\nThey exchanged \\nmany thoughts as she flew, talking as they had not for weeks. Saphira showed \\nEragon how she used hills and trees to hide and how she could conceal herself \\nin the shadow of a cloud. They scouted the trail for Brom, which proved to be \\nmore arduous than Eragon expected. They could not see the path unless Saphira \\nflew very close to it, in which case she risked being detected.\\nNear midday, an \\nannoying buzz filled Eragon’s ears, and he became aware of a strange pressure \\non his mind. He shook his head, trying to get rid of it, but the tension only \\ngrew stronger. Brom’s words about how people could break into others’ minds \\nflashed through Eragon’s head, and he frantically tried to clear his thoughts. \\nHe concentrated on one of Saphira’s scales and forced himself to ignore \\neverything else. The pressure faded for a moment and then returned, greater \\nthan ever. A sudden gust rocked Saphira, and Eragon’s concentration slipped. \\nBefore he could marshal any defenses, the force broke through. But instead of \\nthe invasive presence of another mind, there were only the words,What do you \\nthink you’re doing? Get down here. I found something important.\\nBrom?queried Eragon.\\nYes,the old man said \\nirritably.Now get that oversized lizard of yours to land. I’m here. . . . \\nHe sent a picture of his location. Eragon quickly told Saphira where to go, and \\nshe banked toward the river below. Meanwhile, he strung his bow and drew \\nseveral arrows.\\nIf there’s \\ntrouble, I’ll be ready for it. \\nAs will I,said Saphira.\\nWhen they \\nreached Brom, Eragon saw him standing in a clearing, waving his arms. Saphira \\nlanded, and Eragon jumped off her and looked for danger. The horses were tied \\nto a tree on the edge of the clearing, but otherwise Brom was alone. Eragon \\ntrotted over and asked, “What’s wrong?”\\nBrom scratched \\nhis chin and muttered a string of curses. “Don’t ever block me out like that \\nagain. It’s hard enough for me to reach you without having to fight to make \\nmyself heard.”\\n“Sorry.”\\nHe snorted. “I \\nwas farther down the river when I noticed that the Ra’zac’s tracks had ceased. \\nI backtracked until I found where they had disappeared. Look at the ground and \\ntell me what you see.”\\nEragon knelt and \\nexamined the dirt and found a confusion of impressions that were difficult to \\ndecipher. Numerous Ra’zac footprints overlapped each other. Eragon guessed that \\nthe tracks were only a few days old. Superimposed over them were long, thick \\ngouges torn into the ground. They looked familiar, but Eragon could not say \\nwhy.\\nHe stood, \\nshaking his head. “I don’t have any idea what . . .” Then his eyes fell on \\nSaphira and he realized what had made the gouges. Every time she took off, her \\nback claws dug into the ground and ripped it in the same manner. “This doesn’t \\nmake any sense, but the only thing I can think of is that the Ra’zac flew off \\non dragons. Or else they got onto giant birds and disappeared into the heavens. \\nTell me you have a better explanation.”\\nBrom shrugged. “I’ve \\nheard reports of the Ra’zac moving from place to place with incredible speed, \\nbut this is the first evidence I’ve had of it. It will be almost impossible to \\nfind them if they have flying steeds. They aren’t dragons—I know that much. A \\ndragon would never consent to bear a Ra’zac.”\\n“What do we do? \\nSaphira can’t track them through the sky. Even if she could, we would leave you \\nfar behind.”\\n“There’s no easy \\nsolution to this riddle,” said Brom. “Let’s have lunch while we think on it. \\nPerhaps inspiration will strike us while we eat.” Eragon glumly went to his \\nbags for food. They ate in silence, staring at the empty sky.\\nOnce again \\nEragon thought of home and wondered what Roran was doing. A vision of the burnt \\nfarm appeared before him and grief threatened to overwhelm him.What will I \\ndo if we can’t find the Ra’zac? What is my purpose then? I could return to \\nCarvahall— he plucked a twig from the ground and snapped it between two \\nfingers—or just travel with Brom and continue my training.Eragon stared \\nout at the plains, hoping to quiet his thoughts.\\nWhen Brom \\nfinished eating, he stood and threw back his hood. “I have considered every \\ntrick I know, every word of power within my grasp, and all the skills we have, \\nbut I still don’t see how we can find the Ra’zac.” Eragon slumped against \\nSaphira in despair. “Saphira could show herself at some town. That would draw \\nthe Ra’zac like flies to honey. But it would be an extremely risky thing to \\nattempt. The Ra’zac would bring soldiers with them, and the king might be \\ninterested enough to come himself, which would spell certain death for you and \\nme.”\\n“So what now?” \\nasked Eragon, throwing his hands up.Do you have any ideas, Saphira?\\nNo. \\n“That’s up to \\nyou,” said Brom. “This is your crusade.”\\nEragon ground \\nhis teeth angrily and stalked away from Brom and Saphira. Just as he was about \\nto enter the trees, his foot struck something hard. Lying on the ground was a \\nmetal flask with a leather strap just long enough to hang off someone’s \\nshoulder. A silver insignia Eragon recognized as the Ra’zac’s symbol was \\nwrought into it.\\nExcited, he \\npicked up the flask and unscrewed its cap. A cloying smell filled the air—the \\nsame one he had noticed when he found Garrow in the wreckage of their house. He \\ntilted the flask, and a drop of clear, shiny liquid fell on his finger. \\nInstantly Eragon’s finger burned as if it were on fire. He yelped and scrubbed \\nhis hand on the ground. After a moment the pain subsided to a dull throbbing. A \\npatch of skin had been eaten away.\\nGrimacing, he \\njogged back to Brom. “Look what I found.” Brom took the flask and examined it, \\nthen poured a bit of the liquid into the cap. Eragon started to warn him, \\n“Watch out, it’ll burn—”\\n“My skin, I \\nknow,” said Brom. “And I suppose you went ahead and poured it all over your \\nhand. Your finger? Well, at least you showed sense enough not to drink it. Only \\na puddle would have been left of you.”\\n“What is it?” \\nasked Eragon.\\n“Oil from the \\npetals of the Seithr plant, which grows on a small island in the frigid \\nnorthern seas. In its natural state, the oil is used for preserving pearls—it \\nmakes them lustrous and strong. But when specific words are spoken over the \\noil, along with a blood sacrifice, it gains the property to eat any flesh. That \\nalone wouldn’t make it special—there are plenty of acids that can dissolve \\nsinew and bone—except for the fact that it leaves everything else untouched. \\nYou can dip anything into the oil and pull it out unharmed, unless it was once \\npart of an animal or human. This has made it a weapon of choice for torture and \\nassassination. It can be stored in wood, slathered on the point of a spear, or \\ndripped onto sheets so that the next person to touch them will be burned. There \\nare myriad uses for it, limited only by your ingenuity. Any injury caused by it \\nis always slow to heal. It’s rather rare and expensive, especially this \\nconverted form.”\\nEragon \\nremembered the terrible burns that had covered Garrow.That’s what they used \\non him, he realized with horror. “I wonder why the Ra’zac left it behind if \\nit’s so valuable.”\\n“It must have \\nslipped off when they flew away.”\\n“But why didn’t \\nthey come back for it? I doubt that the king will be pleased that they lost \\nit.”\\n“No, he won’t,” \\nsaid Brom, “but he would be even more displeased if they delayed bringing him \\nnews of you. In fact, if the Ra’zac have reached him by now, you can be sure \\nthat the king has learned your name. And that means we will have to be much \\nmore careful when we go into towns. There will be notices and alerts about you \\nposted throughout the Empire.”\\nEragon paused to \\nthink. “This oil, how rare is it exactly?”\\n“Like diamonds \\nin a pig trough,” said Brom. He amended himself after a second, “Actually, the \\nnormal oil is used by jewelers, but only those who can afford it.”\\n“So there are \\npeople who trade in it?”\\n“Perhaps one, \\nmaybe two.”\\n“Good,” said \\nEragon. “Now, do the cities along the coast keep shipping records?”\\nBrom’s eyes \\nbrightened. “Of course they do. If we could get to those records, they would \\ntell us who brought the oil south and where it went from there.”\\n“And the record \\nof the Empire’s purchase will tell us where the Ra’zac live!” concluded Eragon. \\n“I don’t know how many people can afford this oil, but it shouldn’t be hard to \\nfigure out which ones aren’t working for the Empire.”\\n“Genius!” \\nexclaimed Brom, smiling. “I wish I had thought of this years ago; it would have \\nsaved me many headaches. The coast is dotted with numerous cities and towns \\nwhere ships can land. I suppose that Teirm would be the place to start, as it \\ncontrols most of the trade.” Brom paused. “The last I heard, my old friend Jeod \\nlives there. We haven’t seen each other for many years, but he might be willing \\nto help us. And because he’s a merchant, it’s possible that he has access to \\nthose records.”\\n“How do we get \\nto Teirm?”\\n“We’ll have to \\ngo southwest until we reach a high pass in the Spine. Once on the other side, \\nwe can head up the coast to Teirm,” said Brom. A gentle wind pulled at his \\nhair.\\n“Can we reach \\nthe pass within a week?”\\n“Easily. If we \\nangle away from the Ninor and to our right, we might be able to see the \\nmountains by tomorrow.”\\nEragon went to \\nSaphira and mounted her. “I’ll see you at dinner, then.” When they were at a \\ngood height, he said,I’m going to ride Cadoc tomorrow. Before you protest, know \\nthat I am only doing it because I want to talk with Brom.\\nYou should ride \\nwith him every other day. That way you can still receive your instruction, and \\nI will have time to hunt. \\nYou won’t be \\ntroubled by it?\\n\\nIt is necessary. \\nWhen they landed \\nfor the day, he was pleased to discover that his legs did not hurt. The saddle \\nhad protected him well from Saphira’s scales.\\nEragon and Brom \\nhad their nightly fight, but it lacked energy, as both were preoccupied with \\nthe day’s events. By the time they finished, Eragon’s arms burned from \\nZar’roc’s unaccustomed weight.\\nAS ONG FOR THEROAD\\nThe next day \\nwhile they were riding, Eragon asked Brom, “What is the sea like?”\\n“You must have \\nheard it described before,” said Brom.\\n“Yes, but what \\nis it really like?”\\nBrom’s eyes grew \\nhazy, as if he looked upon some hidden scene. “The sea is emotion incarnate. It \\nloves, hates, and weeps. It defies all attempts to capture it with words and \\nrejects all shackles. No matter what you say about it, there is always that \\nwhich you can’t. Do you remember what I told you about how the elves came over \\nthe sea?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Though they \\nlive far from the coast, they retain a great fascination and passion for the \\nocean. The sound of crashing waves, the smell of salt air, it affects them \\ndeeply and has inspired many of their loveliest songs. There is one that tells \\nof this love, if you want to hear it.”\\n“I would,” said \\nEragon, interested.\\nBrom cleared his \\nthroat and said, “I will translate it from the ancient language as best I can. \\nIt won’t be perfect, but perhaps it will give you an idea of how the original \\nsounds.” He pulled Snowfire to a stop and closed his eyes. He was silent for a \\nwhile, then chanted softly:\\n\\xa0\\nO liquid \\ntemptress ’neath the azure sky, \\nYour gilded expanse \\ncalls me, calls me.\\n\\nFor I would sail \\never on,\\n\\nWere it not for \\nthe elven maid,\\n\\nWho calls me, \\ncalls me.\\n\\nShe binds my \\nheart with a lily-white tie, \\nNever to be \\nbroken, save by the sea, \\nEver to be torn \\ntwixt the trees and the waves. \\n\\xa0\\nThe words echoed \\nhauntingly in Eragon’s head. “There is much more to that song, the ‘Du Silbena \\nDatia.’ I have only recited one of its verses. It tells the sad tale of two \\nlovers, Acallamh and Nuada, who were separated by longing for the sea. The \\nelves find great meaning in the story.”\\n“It’s \\nbeautiful,” said Eragon simply.\\nThe Spine was a \\nfaint outline on the horizon when they halted that evening.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen they \\narrived at the Spine’s foothills, they turned and followed the mountains south. \\nEragon was glad to be near the mountains again; they placed comforting \\nboundaries on the world. Three days later they came to a wide road rutted by \\nwagon wheels. “This is the main road between the capital, Urû’baen, and Teirm,” \\nsaid Brom. “It’s widely used and a favorite route for merchants. We have to be \\nmore cautious. This isn’t the busiest time of year, but a few people are bound \\nto be using the road.”\\nDays passed \\nquickly as they continued to trek along the Spine, searching for the mountain \\npass. Eragon could not complain of boredom. When not learning the elven \\nlanguage, he was either learning how to care for Saphira or practicing magic. \\nEragon also learned how to kill game with magic, which saved them time hunting. \\nHe would hold a small rock on his hand and shoot it at his prey. It was \\nimpossible to miss. The results of his efforts roasted over the fire each \\nnight. And after dinner, Brom and Eragon would spar with swords and, \\noccasionally, fists.\\nThe long days \\nand strenuous work stripped Eragon’s body of excess fat. His arms became \\ncorded, and his tanned skin rippled with lean muscles.Everything about me is \\nturning hard, he thought dryly.\\nWhen they \\nfinally reached the pass, Eragon saw that a river rushed out of it and cut \\nacross the road. “This is the Toark,” explained Brom. “We’ll follow it all the \\nway to the sea.”\\n“How can we,” \\nlaughed Eragon, “if it flows out of the Spine inthis direction? It won’t \\nend up in the ocean unless it doubles back on itself.”\\nBrom twisted the \\nring on his finger. “Because in the middle of the mountains rests the Woadark \\nLake. A river flows from each end of it and both are called the Toark. We see \\nthe eastward one now. It runs to the south and winds through the brush until it \\njoins Leona Lake. The other one goes to the sea.”\\nAfter two days \\nin the Spine, they came upon a rock ledge from which they could see clearly out \\nof the mountains. Eragon noticed how the land flattened in the distance, and he \\ngroaned at the leagues they still had to traverse. Brom pointed. “Down there \\nand to the north lies Teirm. It is an old city. Some say it’s where the elves \\nfirst landed in Alagaësia. Its citadel has never fallen, nor have its warriors \\never been defeated.” He spurred Snowfire forward and left the ledge.\\n\\xa0\\nIt took them \\nuntil noon the next day to descend through the foothills and arrive at the \\nother side of the Spine, where the forested land quickly leveled out. Without \\nthe mountains to hide behind, Saphira flew close to the ground, using every \\nhollow and dip in the land to conceal herself.\\nBeyond the \\nforest, they noticed a change. The countryside was covered with soft turf and \\nheather that their feet sank into. Moss clung to every stone and branch and \\nlined the streams that laced the ground. Pools of mud pocked the road where \\nhorses had trampled the dirt. Before long both Brom and Eragon were splattered \\nwith grime.\\n“Why is \\neverything green?” asked Eragon. “Don’t they have winter here?”\\n“Yes, but the \\nseason is mild. Mist and fog roll in from the sea and keep everything alive. \\nSome find it to their liking, but to me it’s dreary and depressing.”\\nWhen evening \\nfell, they set up camp in the driest spot they could find. As they ate, Brom \\ncommented, “You should continue to ride Cadoc until we reach Teirm. It’s likely \\nthat we’ll meet other travelers now that we are out of the Spine, and it will \\nbe better if you are with me. An old man traveling alone will raise suspicion. \\nWith you at my side, no one will ask questions. Besides, I don’t want to show \\nup at the city and have someone who saw me on the trail wondering where you \\nsuddenly came from.”\\n“Will we use our \\nown names?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom thought \\nabout it. “We won’t be able to deceive Jeod. He already knows my name, and I \\nthink I trust him with yours. But to everyone else, I will be Neal and you will \\nbe my nephew Evan. If our tongues slip and give us away, it probably won’t make \\na difference, but I don’t want our names in anyone’s heads. People have an \\nannoying habit of remembering things they shouldn’t.”\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 26': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAT ASTE OFTEIRM\\nAfter two days of \\ntraveling north toward the ocean, Saphira sighted Teirm. A heavy fog clung to \\nthe ground, obscuring Brom’s and Eragon’s sight until a breeze from the west \\nblew the mist away. Eragon gaped as Teirm was suddenly revealed before them, \\nnestled by the edge of the shimmering sea, where proud ships were docked with \\nfurled sails. The surf’s dull thunder could be heard in the distance.\\nThe city was \\ncontained behind a white wall—a hundred feet tall and thirty feet thick—with \\nrows of rectangular arrow slits lining it and a walkway on top for soldiers and \\nwatchmen. The wall’s smooth surface was broken by two iron portcullises, one \\nfacing the western sea, the other opening south to the road. Above the wall—and \\nset against its northeast section—rose a huge citadel built of giant stones and \\nturrets. In the highest tower, a lighthouse lantern gleamed brilliantly. The \\ncastle was the only thing visible over the fortifications.\\nSoldiers guarded \\nthe southern gate but held their pikes carelessly. “This is our first test,” \\nsaid Brom. “Let’s hope they haven’t received reports of us from the Empire and \\nwon’t detain us. Whatever happens, don’t panic or act suspiciously.”\\nEragon told \\nSaphira,You should land somewhere now and hide. We’re going in.\\nSticking your \\nnose where it doesn’t belong. Again,she said sourly.\\nI know. But Brom \\nand I do have some advantages most people don’t.We’ll be all right. \\nIf anything \\nhappens, I’m going to pin you to my back and never let you off. \\nI love you too. \\nThen I will bind \\nyou all the tighter.\\n\\nEragon and Brom \\nrode toward the gate, trying to appear casual. A yellow pennant bearing the \\noutline of a roaring lion and an arm holding a lily blossom waved over the \\nentrance. As they neared the wall, Eragon asked in amazement, “How big is this \\nplace?”\\n“Larger than any \\ncity you have ever seen,” said Brom.\\nAt the entrance \\nto Teirm, the guards stood straighter and blocked the gate with their pikes. \\n“Wha’s yer name?” asked one of them in a bored tone.\\n“I’m called \\nNeal,” said Brom in a wheezy voice, slouching to one side, an expression of \\nhappy idiocy on his face.\\n“And who’s th’ \\nother one?” asked the guard.\\n“Well, I wus \\ngettin’ to that. This’ed be m’nephew Evan. He’s m’sister’s boy, not a . . .”\\nThe guard nodded \\nimpatiently. “Yeah, yeah. And yer business here?”\\n“He’s visitin’ \\nan old friend,” supplied Eragon, dropping his voice into a thick accent. “I’m \\nalong t’ make sure he don’t get lost, if y’ get m’meaning. He ain’t as young as \\nhe used to be—had a bit too much sun when he was young’r. Touch o’ the brain \\nfever, y’ know.” Brom bobbed his head pleasantly.\\n“Right. Go on \\nthrough,” said the guard, waving his hand and dropping the pike. “Just make \\nsure he doesn’t cause any trouble.”\\n“Oh, he won’t,” \\npromised Eragon. He urged Cadoc forward, and they rode into Teirm. The \\ncobblestone street clacked under the horses’ hooves.\\nOnce they were \\naway from the guards, Brom sat up and growled, “Touch of brain fever, eh?”\\n“I couldn’t let \\nyou have all the fun,” teased Eragon.\\nBrom harrumphed \\nand looked away.\\nThe houses were \\ngrim and foreboding. Small, deep windows let in only sparse rays of light. \\nNarrow doors were recessed into the buildings. The tops of the roofs were \\nflat—except for metal railings—and all were covered with slate shingles. Eragon \\nnoticed that the houses closest to Teirm’s outer wall were no more than one \\nstory, but the buildings got progressively higher as they went in. Those next \\nto the citadel were tallest of all, though insignificant compared to the \\nfortress.\\n“This place \\nlooks ready for war,” said Eragon.\\nBrom nodded. \\n“Teirm has a history of being attacked by pirates, Urgals, and other enemies. \\nIt has long been a center of commerce. There will always be conflict where \\nriches gather in such abundance. The people here have been forced to take extraordinary \\nmeasures to keep themselves from being overrun. It also helps that Galbatorix \\ngives them soldiers to defend their city.”\\n“Why are some \\nhouses higher than others?”\\n“Look at the \\ncitadel,” said Brom, pointing. “It has an unobstructed view of Teirm. If the \\nouter wall were breached, archers would be posted on all the roofs. Because the \\nhouses in the front, by the outer wall, are lower, the men farther back could \\nshoot over them without fear of hitting their comrades. Also, if the enemy were \\nto capture those houses and put their own archers on them, it would be an easy \\nmatter to shoot them down.”\\n“I’ve never seen \\na city planned like this,” said Eragon in wonder.\\n“Yes, but it was \\nonly done after Teirm was nearly burned down by a pirate raid,” commented Brom. \\nAs they continued up the street, people gave them searching looks, but there \\nwas not an undue amount of interest.\\nCompared to our \\nreception at Daret, we’ve been welcomed with open arms. Perhaps Teirm has \\nescaped notice by the Urgals,thought Eragon. He changed his opinion \\nwhen a large man shouldered past them, a sword hanging from his waist. There \\nwere other, subtler signs of adverse times: no children played in the streets, \\npeople bore hard expressions, and many houses were deserted, with weeds growing \\nfrom cracks in their stone-covered yards. “It looks like they’ve had trouble,” \\nsaid Eragon.\\n“The same as \\neverywhere else,” said Brom grimly. “We have to find Jeod.” They led their \\nhorses across the street to a tavern and tied them to the hitching post. “The \\nGreen Chestnut . . . wonderful,” muttered Brom, looking at the battered sign \\nabove them as he and Eragon entered the building.\\nThe dingy room \\nfelt unsafe. A fire smoldered in the fireplace, yet no one bothered to throw \\nmore wood on it. A few lonely people in the corners nursed their drinks with \\nsullen expressions. A man missing two fingers sat at a far table, eyeing his \\ntwitching stumps. The bartender had a cynical twist to his lips and held a \\nglass in his hand that he kept polishing, even though it was broken.\\nBrom leaned \\nagainst the bar and asked, “Do you know where we can find a man called Jeod?” \\nEragon stood at his side, fiddling with the tip of his bow by his waist. It was \\nslung across his back, but right then he wished that it were in his hands.\\nThe bartender \\nsaid in an overly loud voice, “Now, why would I know something like that? Do \\nyou think I keep track of the mangy louts in this forsaken place?” Eragon \\nwinced as all eyes turned toward them.\\nBrom kept \\ntalking smoothly. “Could you be enticed to remember?” He slid some coins onto \\nthe bar.\\nThe man \\nbrightened and put his glass down. “Could be,” he replied, lowering his voice, \\n“but my memory takes a great deal of prodding.” Brom’s face soured, but he slid \\nmore coins onto the bar. The bartender sucked on one side of his cheek \\nundecidedly. “All right,” he finally said, and reached for the coins.\\nBefore he \\ntouched them, the man missing two fingers called out from his table, “Gareth, \\nwhat in th’ blazes do you think you’re doing? Anyone on the street could tell \\nthem where Jeod lives. What are you charging them for?”\\nBrom swept the \\ncoins back into his purse. Gareth shot a venomous look at the man at the table, \\nthen turned his back on them and picked up the glass again. Brom went to the \\nstranger and said, “Thanks. The name’s Neal. This is Evan.”\\nThe man raised \\nhis mug to them. “Martin, and of course you met Gareth.” His voice was deep and \\nrough. Martin gestured at some empty chairs. “Go ahead and sit down. I don’t \\nmind.” Eragon took a chair and arranged it so his back was to the wall and he \\nfaced the door. Martin raised an eyebrow, but made no comment.\\n“You just saved \\nme a few crowns,” said Brom.\\n“My pleasure. \\nCan’t blame Gareth, though—business hasn’t been doing so well lately.” Martin \\nscratched his chin. “Jeod lives on the west side of town, right next to Angela, \\nthe herbalist. Do you have business with him?”\\n“Of a sort,” \\nsaid Brom.\\n“Well, he won’t \\nbe interested in buying anything; he just lost another ship a few days ago.”\\nBrom latched \\nonto the news with interest. “What happened? It wasn’t Urgals, was it?”\\n“No,” said \\nMartin. “They’ve left the area. No one’s seen ’em in almost a year. It seems \\nthey’ve all gone south and east. But they aren’t the problem. See, most of our \\nbusiness is through sea trade, as I’m sure you know. Well,” he stopped to drink \\nfrom his mug, “starting several months ago, someone’s been attacking our ships. \\nIt’s not the usual piracy, because only ships that carry the goods of certain \\nmerchants are attacked. Jeod’s one of ’em. It’s gotten so bad that no captain \\nwill accept those merchants’ goods, which makes life difficult around here. \\nEspecially because some of ’em run the largest shipping businesses in the \\nEmpire. They’re being forced to send goods by land. It’s driven costs painfully \\nhigh, and their caravans don’t always make it.”\\n“Do you have any \\nidea who’s responsible? There must be witnesses,” said Brom.\\nMartin shook his \\nhead. “No one survives the attacks. Ships go out, then disappear; they’re never \\nseen again.” He leaned toward them and said in a confidential tone, “The \\nsailors are saying that it’s magic.” He nodded and winked, then leaned back.\\nBrom seemed \\nworried by his words. “What do you think?”\\nMartin shrugged \\ncarelessly. “I don’t know. And I don’t think I will unless I’m unfortunate enough \\nto be on one of those captured ships.”\\n“Are you a \\nsailor?” asked Eragon.\\n“No,” snorted \\nMartin. “Do I look like one? The captains hire me to defend their ships against \\npirates. And those thieving scum haven’t been very active lately. Still, it’s a \\ngood job.”\\n“But a dangerous \\none,” said Brom. Martin shrugged again and downed the last of his beer. Brom \\nand Eragon took their leave and headed to the west side of the city, a nicer \\nsection of Teirm. The houses were clean, ornate, and large. The people in the \\nstreets wore expensive finery and walked with authority. Eragon felt \\nconspicuous and out of place.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 27': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA NOLDFRIEND\\nThe herbalist’s \\nshop had a cheery sign and was easy to find. A short, curly-haired woman sat by \\nthe door. She was holding a frog in one hand and writing with the other. Eragon \\nassumed that she was Angela, the herbalist. On either side of the store was a \\nhouse. “Which one do you think is his?” he asked.\\nBrom \\ndeliberated, then said, “Let’s find out.” He approached the woman and asked \\npolitely, “Could you tell us which house Jeod lives in?”\\n“I could.” She \\ncontinued writing.\\n“Will you tell \\nus?”\\n“Yes.” She fell \\nsilent, but her pen scribbled faster than ever. The frog on her hand croaked \\nand looked at them with baleful eyes. Brom and Eragon waited uncomfortably, but \\nshe said no more. Eragon was about to blurt something out when Angela looked \\nup. “Of course I’ll tell you! All you have to do is ask. Your first question \\nwas whether or not Icould tell you, and the second was if Iwould \\ntell you. But you never actually put the question to me.”\\n“Then let me ask \\nproperly,” said Brom with a smile. “Which house is Jeod’s? And why are you \\nholding a frog?”\\n“Now we’re \\ngetting somewhere,” she bantered. “Jeod is on the right. And as for the frog, \\nhe’s actually a toad. I’m trying to prove that toads don’t exist—that there are \\nonly frogs.”\\n“How can toads \\nnot exist if you have one on your hand right now?” interrupted Eragon. \\n“Besides, what good will it do, proving that there are only frogs?”\\nThe woman shook \\nher head vigorously, dark curls bouncing. “No, no, you don’t understand. If I \\nprove toads don’t exist, then this is a frog and never was a toad. Therefore, \\nthe toad you see now doesn’t exist. And,” she raised a small finger, “if I can \\nprove there are only frogs, then toads won’t be able to do anything bad—like \\nmake teeth fall out, cause warts, and poison or kill people. Also, witches \\nwon’t be able to use any of their evil spells because, of course, there won’t \\nbe any toads around.”\\n“I see,” said \\nBrom delicately. “It sounds interesting, and I would like to hear more, but we \\nhave to meet Jeod.”\\n“Of course,” she \\nsaid, waving her hand and returning to her writing.\\nOnce they were \\nout of the herbalist’s hearing, Eragon said, “She’s crazy!”\\n“It’s possible,” \\nsaid Brom, “but you never know. She might discover something useful, so don’t \\ncriticize. Who knows, toads might really be frogs!”\\n“And my shoes \\nare made of gold,” retorted Eragon.\\nThey stopped \\nbefore a door with a wrought-iron knocker and marble doorstep. Brom banged \\nthree times. No one answered. Eragon felt slightly foolish. “Maybe this is the \\nwrong house. Let’s try the other one,” he said. Brom ignored him and knocked \\nagain, pounding loudly.\\nAgain no one \\nanswered. Eragon turned away in exasperation, then heard someone run to the \\ndoor. A young woman with a pale complexion and light blond hair cracked it \\nopen. Her eyes were puffy; it looked like she had been crying, but her voice \\nwas perfectly steady. “Yes, what do you want?”\\n“Does Jeod live \\nhere?” asked Brom kindly.\\nThe woman dipped \\nher head a little. “Yes, he is my husband. Is he expecting you?” She opened the \\ndoor no farther.\\n“No, but we need \\nto talk with him,” said Brom.\\n“He is very \\nbusy.”\\n“We have \\ntraveled far. It’s very important that we see him.”\\nHer face \\nhardened. “He is busy.”\\nBrom bristled, \\nbut his voice stayed pleasant. “Since he is unavailable, would you please give \\nhim a message?” Her mouth twitched, but she consented. “Tell him that a friend \\nfrom Gil’ead is waiting outside.”\\nThe woman seemed \\nsuspicious, but said, “Very well.” She closed the door abruptly. Eragon heard \\nher footsteps recede.\\n“That wasn’t \\nvery polite.” he commented.\\n“Keep your \\nopinions to yourself,” snapped Brom. “And don’t say anything. Let me do the \\ntalking.” He crossed his arms and tapped his fingers. Eragon clamped his mouth \\nshut and looked away.\\nThe door \\nsuddenly flew open, and a tall man burst out of the house. His expensive \\nclothes were rumpled, his gray hair wispy, and he had a mournful face with \\nshort eyebrows. A long scar stretched across his scalp to his temple.\\nAt the sight of \\nthem, his eyes grew wide, and he sagged against the doorframe, speechless. His \\nmouth opened and closed several times like a gasping fish. He asked softly, in \\nan incredulous voice, “Brom . . . ?”\\nBrom put a \\nfinger to his lips and reached forward, clasping the man’s arm. “It’s good to \\nsee you, Jeod! I’m glad that memory has not failed you, but don’t use that \\nname. It would be unfortunate if anyone knew I was here.”\\nJeod looked \\naround wildly, shock plain on his face. “I thought you were dead,” he \\nwhispered. “What happened? Why haven’t you contacted me before?”\\n“All things will \\nbe explained. Do you have a place where we can talk safely?”\\nJeod hesitated, \\nswinging his gaze between Eragon and Brom, face unreadable. Finally he said, \\n“We can’t talk here, but if you wait a moment, I’ll take you somewhere we can.”\\n“Fine,” said \\nBrom. Jeod nodded and vanished behind the door.\\nI hope I can \\nlearn something of Brom’s past,thought Eragon.\\nThere was a \\nrapier at Jeod’s side when he reappeared. An embroidered jacket hung loosely on \\nhis shoulders, matched by a plumed hat. Brom cast a critical eye at the finery, \\nand Jeod shrugged self-consciously.\\nHe took them \\nthrough Teirm toward the citadel. Eragon led the horses behind the two men. \\nJeod gestured at their destination. “Risthart, the lord of Teirm, has decreed \\nthat all the business owners must have their headquarters in his castle. Even \\nthough most of us conduct our business elsewhere, we still have to rent rooms \\nthere. It’s nonsense, but we abide by it anyway to keep him calm. We’ll be free \\nof eavesdroppers in there; the walls are thick.”\\nThey went \\nthrough the fortress’s main gate and into the keep. Jeod strode to a side door \\nand pointed to an iron ring. “You can tie the horses there. No one will bother \\nthem.” When Snowfire and Cadoc were safely tethered, he opened the door with an \\niron key and let them inside.\\nWithin was a \\nlong, empty hallway lit by torches set into the walls. Eragon was surprised by \\nhow cold and damp it was. When he touched the wall, his fingers slid over a \\nlayer of slime. He shivered.\\nJeod snatched a \\ntorch from its bracket and led them down the hall. They stopped before a heavy, \\nwooden door. He unlocked it and ushered them into a room dominated by a \\nbearskin rug laden with stuffed chairs. Bookshelves stacked with leather-bound \\ntomes covered the walls.\\nJeod piled wood \\nin the fireplace, then thrust the torch under it. The fire quickly roared. \\n“You, old man, have some explaining to do.”\\nBrom’s face \\ncrinkled with a smile. “Who are you calling an old man? The last time I saw you \\nthere was no gray in your hair. Now it looks like it’s in the final stages of \\ndecomposition.”\\n“And you look \\nthe same as you did nearly twenty years ago. Time seems to have preserved you \\nas a crotchety old man just to inflict wisdom upon each new generation. Enough \\nof this! Get on with the story. That’s always what you were good at,” said Jeod \\nimpatiently. Eragon’s ears pricked up, and he waited eagerly to hear what Brom \\nwould say.\\nBrom relaxed \\ninto a chair and pulled out his pipe. He slowly blew a smoke ring that turned \\ngreen, darted into the fireplace, then flew up the chimney. “Do you remember \\nwhat we were doing in Gil’ead?”\\n“Yes, of \\ncourse,” said Jeod. “That sort of thing is hard to forget.”\\n“An \\nunderstatement, but true nevertheless,” said Brom dryly. “When we were . . . \\nseparated, I couldn’t find you. In the midst of the turmoil I stumbled into a \\nsmall room. There wasn’t anything extraordinary in it—just crates and boxes—but \\nout of curiosity, I rummaged around anyway. Fortune smiled on me that hour, for \\nI found what we had been searching for.” An expression of shock ran over Jeod’s \\nface. “Once it was in my hands, I couldn’t wait for you. At any second I might \\nhave been discovered, and all lost. Disguising myself as best I could, I fled \\nthe city and ran to the . . .” Brom hesitated and glanced at Eragon, then said, \\n“ran to our friends. They stored it in a vault, for safekeeping, and made me promise \\nto care for whomever received it. Until the day when my skills would be needed, \\nI had to disappear. No one could know that I was alive—not even you—though it \\ngrieved me to pain you unnecessarily. So I went north and hid in Carvahall.”\\nEragon clenched \\nhis jaw, infuriated that Brom was deliberately keeping him in the dark.\\nJeod frowned and \\nasked, “Then our . . . friends knew that you were alive all along?”\\n“Yes.”\\nHe sighed. “I \\nsuppose the ruse was unavoidable, though I wish they had told me. Isn’t Carvahall \\nfarther north, on the other side of the Spine?” Brom inclined his head. For the \\nfirst time, Jeod inspected Eragon. His gray eyes took in every detail. He \\nraised his eyebrows and said, “I assume, then, that you are fulfilling your \\nduty.”\\nBrom shook his head. \\n“No, it’s not that simple. It was stolen a while ago—at least that’s what I \\npresume, for I haven’t received word from our friends, and I suspect their \\nmessengers were waylaid—so I decided to find out what I could. Eragon happened \\nto be traveling in the same direction. We have stayed together for a time now.”\\nJeod looked \\npuzzled. “But if they haven’t sent any messages, how could you know that it \\nwas—”\\nBrom overrode \\nhim quickly, saying, “Eragon’s uncle was brutally killed by the Ra’zac. They \\nburned his home and nearly caught him in the process. He deserves revenge, but \\nthey have left us without a trail to follow, and we need help finding them.”\\nJeod’s face \\ncleared. “I see. . . . But why have you come here? I don’t know where the \\nRa’zac might be hiding, and anyone who does won’t tell you.”\\nStanding, Brom \\nreached into his robe and pulled out the Ra’zac’s flask. He tossed it to Jeod. \\n“There’s Seithr oil in there—the dangerous kind. The Ra’zac were carrying it. \\nThey lost it by the trail, and we happened to find it. We need to see Teirm’s \\nshipping records so we can trace the Empire’s purchases of the oil. That should \\ntell us where the Ra’zac’s lair is.”\\nLines appeared \\non Jeod’s face as he thought. He pointed at the books on the shelves. “Do you \\nsee those? They are all records from my business.One business. You have \\ngotten yourself into a project that could take months. There is another, \\ngreater problem. The records you seek are held in this castle, but only Brand, \\nRisthart’s administrator of trade, sees them on a regular basis. Traders such \\nas myself aren’t allowed to handle them. They fear that we will falsify the \\nresults, thus cheating the Empire of its precious taxes.”\\n“I can deal with \\nthat when the time comes,” said Brom. “But we need a few days of rest before we \\ncan think about proceeding.”\\nJeod smiled. “It \\nseems that it is my turn to help you. My house is yours, of course. Do you have \\nanother name while you are here?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nBrom, “I’m Neal, and the boy is Evan.”\\n“Eragon,” said \\nJeod thoughtfully. “You have a unique name. Few have ever been named after the \\nfirst Rider. In my life I’ve read about only three people who were called \\nsuch.” Eragon was startled that Jeod knew the origin of his name.\\nBrom looked at \\nEragon. “Could you go check on the horses and make sure they’re all right? I \\ndon’t think I tied Snowfire to the ring tightly enough.”\\nThey’re trying \\nto hide something from me. The moment I leave they’re going to talk about it.Eragon shoved \\nhimself out of the chair and left the room, slamming the door shut. Snowfire \\nhad not moved; the knot that held him was fine. Scratching the horses’ necks, \\nEragon leaned sullenly against the castle wall.\\nIt’s not fair,he complained to \\nhimself.If only I could hear what they are saying. He jolted upright, \\nelectrified. Brom had once taught him some words that would enhance his \\nhearing.Keen ears aren’t exactly what I want, but I should be able to make \\nthe words work. After all, look what I could do with brisingr!\\nHe concentrated \\nintensely and reached for his power. Once it was within his grasp, he said, \\n“Thverr stenr un atra eka hórna!” and imbued the words with his will. As the \\npower rushed out of him, he heard a faint whisper in his ears, but nothing \\nmore. Disappointed, he sank back, then started as Jeod said, “—and I’ve been \\ndoing that for almost eight years now.”\\nEragon looked \\naround. No one was there except for a few guards standing against the far wall \\nof the keep. Grinning, he sat on the courtyard and closed his eyes.\\n“I never \\nexpected you to become a merchant,” said Brom. “After all the time you spent in \\nbooks. And finding the passageway in that manner! What made you take up trading \\ninstead of remaining a scholar?”\\n“After Gil’ead, \\nI didn’t have much taste for sitting in musty rooms and reading scrolls. I \\ndecided to help Ajihad as best I could, but I’m no warrior. My father was a \\nmerchant as well—you may remember that. He helped me get started. However, the \\nbulk of my business is nothing more than a front to get goods into Surda.”\\n“But I take it \\nthat things have been going badly,” said Brom.\\n“Yes, none of \\nthe shipments have gotten through lately, and Tronjheim is running low on \\nsupplies. Somehow the Empire—at least I think it’s them—has discovered those of \\nus who have been helping to support Tronjheim. But I’m still not convinced that \\nit’s the Empire. No one sees any soldiers. I don’t understand it. Perhaps \\nGalbatorix hired mercenaries to harass us.”\\n“I heard that \\nyou lost a ship recently.”\\n“The last one I \\nowned,” answered Jeod bitterly. “Every man on it was loyal and brave. I doubt \\nI’ll ever see them again. . . . The only option I have left is to send caravans \\nto Surda or Gil’ead—which I know won’t get there, no matter how many guards I \\nhire—or charter someone else’s ship to carry the goods. But no one will take \\nthem now.”\\n“How many \\nmerchants have been helping you?” asked Brom.\\n“Oh, a good \\nnumber up and down the seaboard. All of them have been plagued by the same \\ntroubles. I know what you are thinking; I’ve pondered it many a night myself, \\nbut I cannot bear the thought of a traitor with that much knowledge and power. \\nIf there is one, we’re all in jeopardy. You should return to Tronjheim.”\\n“And take Eragon \\nthere?” interrupted Brom. “They’d tear him apart. It’s the worst place he could \\nbe right now. Maybe in a few months or, even better, a year. Can you imagine \\nhow the dwarves will react? Everyone will be trying to influence him, \\nespecially Islanzadi. He and Saphira won’t be safe in Tronjheim until I at \\nleast get them through tuatha du orothrim.”\\nDwarves!thought Eragon \\nexcitedly.Where is this Tronjheim? And why did he tell Jeod about Saphira? \\nHe shouldn’t have done that without asking me!\\n“Still, I have a \\nfeeling that they are in need of your power and wisdom.”\\n“Wisdom,” \\nsnorted Brom. “I’m just what you said earlier—a crotchety old man.”\\n“Many would \\ndisagree.”\\n“Let them. I’ve \\nno need to explain myself. No, Ajihad will have to get along without me. What \\nI’m doing now is much more important. But the prospect of a traitor raises \\ntroubling questions. I wonder if that’s how the Empire knew where to be. . . .” \\nHis voice trailed off.\\n“And I wonder \\nwhy I haven’t been contacted about this,” said Jeod.\\n“Maybe they \\ntried. But if there’s a traitor . . .” Brom paused. “I have to send word to \\nAjihad. Do you have a messenger you can trust?”\\n“I think so,” \\nsaid Jeod. “It depends on where he would have to go.”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Brom. “I’ve been isolated so long, my contacts have probably died or \\nforgotten me. Could you send him to whoever receives your shipments?”\\n“Yes, but it’ll \\nbe risky.”\\n“What isn’t \\nthese days? How soon can he leave?”\\n“He can go in \\nthe morning. I’ll send him to Gil’ead. It will be faster,” said Jeod. “What can \\nhe take to convince Ajihad the message comes from you?”\\n“Here, give your \\nman my ring. And tell him that if he loses it, I’ll personally tear his liver \\nout. It was given to me by the queen.”\\n“Aren’t you \\ncheery,” commented Jeod.\\nBrom grunted. \\nAfter a long silence he said, “We’d better go out and join Eragon. I get \\nworried when he’s alone. That boy has an unnatural propensity for being \\nwherever there’s trouble.”\\n“Are you \\nsurprised?”\\n“Not really.”\\nEragon heard \\nchairs being pushed back. He quickly pulled his mind away and opened his eyes. \\n“What’s going on?” he muttered to himself.Jeod and other traders are in \\ntrouble for helping people the Empire doesn’t favor. Brom found something in \\nGil’ead and went to Carvahall to hide. What could be so important that he would \\nlet his own friend think he was dead for nearly twenty years? He mentioned a \\nqueen—when there aren’t any queens in the known kingdoms—and dwarves, who, as \\nhe himself told me, disappeared underground long ago.\\nHe wanted \\nanswers! But he would not confront Brom now and risk jeopardizing their \\nmission. No, he would wait until they left Teirm, and then he would persist \\nuntil the old man explained his secrets. Eragon’s thoughts were still whirling \\nwhen the door opened.\\n“Were the horses \\nall right?” asked Brom.\\n“Fine,” said \\nEragon. They untied the horses and left the castle.\\nAs they \\nreentered the main body of Teirm, Brom said, “So, Jeod, you finally got \\nmarried. And,” he winked slyly, “to a lovely young woman. Congratulations.”\\nJeod did not seem \\nhappy with the compliment. He hunched his shoulders and stared down at the \\nstreet. “Whether congratulations are in order is debatable right now. Helen \\nisn’t very happy.”\\n“Why? What does \\nshe want?” asked Brom.\\n“The usual,” \\nsaid Jeod with a resigned shrug. “A good home, happy children, food on the \\ntable, and pleasant company. The problem is that she comes from a wealthy \\nfamily; her father has invested heavily in my business. If I keep suffering \\nthese losses, there won’t be enough money for her to live the way she’s used \\nto.”\\nJeod continued, \\n“But please, my troubles are not your troubles. A host should never bother his \\nguests with his own concerns. While you are in my house, I will let nothing \\nmore than an over-full stomach disturb you.”\\n“Thank you,” \\nsaid Brom. “We appreciate the hospitality. Our travels have long been without \\ncomforts of any kind. Do you happen to know where we could find an inexpensive \\nshop? All this riding has worn out our clothes.”\\n“Of course. \\nThat’s my job,” said Jeod, lightening up. He talked eagerly about prices and \\nstores until his house was in sight. Then he asked, “Would you mind if we went \\nsomewhere else to eat? It might be awkward if you came in right now.”\\n“Whatever makes \\nyou feel comfortable,” said Brom.\\nJeod looked \\nrelieved. “Thanks. Let’s leave your horses in my stable.”\\nThey did as he \\nsuggested, then followed him to a large tavern. Unlike the Green Chestnut, this \\none was loud, clean, and full of boisterous people. When the main course \\narrived—a stuffed suckling pig—Eragon eagerly dug into the meat, but he \\nespecially savored the potatoes, carrots, turnips, and sweet apples that \\naccompanied it. It had been a long time since he had eaten much more than wild \\ngame.\\nThey lingered \\nover the meal for hours as Brom and Jeod swapped stories. Eragon did not mind. \\nHe was warm, a lively tune jangled in the background, and there was more than \\nenough food. The spirited tavern babble fell pleasantly on his ears.\\nWhen they \\nfinally exited the tavern, the sun was nearing the horizon. “You two go ahead; \\nI have to check on something,” Eragon said. He wanted to see Saphira and make \\nsure that she was safely hidden.\\nBrom agreed \\nabsently. “Be careful. Don’t take too long.”\\n“Wait,” said \\nJeod. “Are you going outside Teirm?” Eragon hesitated, then reluctantly nodded. \\n“Make sure you’re inside the walls before dark. The gates close then, and the \\nguards won’t let you back in until morning.”\\n“I won’t be \\nlate,” promised Eragon. He turned around and loped down a side street, toward \\nTeirm’s outer wall. Once out of the city, he breathed deeply, enjoying the \\nfresh air.Saphira! he called.Where are you? She guided him off \\nthe road, to the base of a mossy cliff surrounded by maples. He saw her head \\npoke out of the trees on the top and waved.How am I supposed to get up there?\\nIf you find a \\nclearing, I’ll come down and get you. \\nNo,he said, eyeing \\nthe cliff,that won’t be necessary.I’ll just climb up.\\nIt’s too \\ndangerous.\\n\\nAnd you worry \\ntoo much. Let me have some fun. \\nEragon pulled \\noff his gloves and started climbing. He relished the physical challenge. There \\nwere plenty of handholds, so the ascent was easy. He was soon high above the \\ntrees. Halfway up, he stopped on a ledge to catch his breath.\\nOnce his \\nstrength returned, he stretched up for the next handhold, but his arm was not \\nlong enough. Stymied, he searched for another crevice or ridge to grasp. There \\nwas none. He tried backing down, but his legs could not reach his last \\nfoothold. Saphira watched with unblinking eyes. He gave up and said,I could \\nuse some help.\\nThis is your own \\nfault.\\n\\nYes! I know. Are \\nyou going to get me down or not? \\nIf I weren’t \\naround, you would be in a very bad situation. \\nEragon rolled \\nhis eyes.You don’t have to tell me.\\nYou’re right. \\nAfter all, how can a mere dragon expect to tell a man like yourself what to do? \\nIn fact, everyone should stand in awe of your brilliance of finding the only \\ndead end. Why, if you had started a few feet in either direction, the path to \\nthe top would have been clear.She cocked her head at him, eyes bright.\\nAll right! I \\nmade a mistake. Now can you please get me out of here?he pleaded. She \\npulled her head back from the edge of the cliff. After a moment he called, \\n“Saphira?” Above him were only swaying trees. “Saphira! Come back!” he roared.\\nWith a loud \\ncrash Saphira barreled off the top of the cliff, flipping around in midair. She \\nfloated down to Eragon like a huge bat and grabbed his shirt with her claws, \\nscratching his back. He let go of the rocks as she yanked him up in the air. \\nAfter a brief flight, she set him down gently on the top of the cliff and \\ntugged her claws out of his shirt.\\nFoolishness,said Saphira \\ngently.\\nEragon looked \\naway, studying the landscape. The cliff provided a wonderful view of their \\nsurroundings, especially the foaming sea, as well as protection against \\nunwelcome eyes. Only birds would see Saphira here. It was an ideal location.\\nIs Brom’s friend \\ntrustworthy?she \\nasked.\\nI don’t know.Eragon proceeded \\nto recount the day’s events.There are forces circling us that we aren’t \\naware of. Sometimes I wonder if we can ever understand the true motives of the \\npeople around us. They all seem to have secrets.\\nIt is the way of \\nthe world. Ignore all the schemes and trust in the nature of each person. Brom \\nis good. He means us no harm. We don’t have to fear his plans. \\nI hope so,he said, looking \\ndown at his hands.\\nThis finding of \\nthe Ra’zac through writing is a strange way of tracking,she remarked.Would \\nthere be a way to use magic to see the records without being inside the room?\\nI’m not sure. \\nYou would have to combine the word forseeingwithdistance. . . or \\nmaybelightanddistance.Either way, it seems rather difficult. I’ll \\nask Brom.\\nThat would be \\nwise.They \\nlapsed into tranquil silence.\\nYou know, we may \\nhave to stay here awhile. \\nSaphira’s answer \\nheld a hard edge.And as always, I will be left to wait outside.\\nThat is not how \\nI want it. Soon enough we will travel together again. \\nMay that day \\ncome quickly.\\n\\nEragon smiled \\nand hugged her. He noticed then how rapidly the light was fading.I have to \\ngo now, before I’m locked out of Teirm. Hunt tomorrow, and I will see you in \\nthe evening.\\nShe spread her \\nwings.Come, I will take you down. He got onto her scaly back and held on \\ntightly as she launched off the cliff, glided over the trees, then landed on a \\nknoll. Eragon thanked her and ran back to Teirm.\\nHe came into \\nsight of the portcullis just as it was beginning to lower. Calling for them to \\nwait, he put on a burst of speed and slipped inside seconds before the gateway \\nslammed closed. “Ya cut that a little close,” observed one of the guards.\\n“It won’t happen \\nagain,” assured Eragon, bending over to catch his breath. He wound his way \\nthrough the darkened city to Jeod’s house. A lantern hung outside like a \\nbeacon.\\nA plump butler \\nanswered his knock and ushered him inside without a word. Tapestries covered \\nthe stone walls. Elaborate rugs dotted the polished wood floor, which glowed \\nwith the light from three gold candelabra hanging from the ceiling. Smoke drifted \\nthrough the air and collected above.\\n“This way, sir. \\nYour friend is in the study.”\\nThey passed \\nscores of doorways until the butler opened one to reveal a study. Books covered \\nthe room’s walls. But unlike those in Jeod’s office, these came in every size \\nand shape. A fireplace filled with blazing logs warmed the room. Brom and Jeod \\nsat before an oval writing desk, talking amiably. Brom raised his pipe and said \\nin a jovial voice, “Ah, here you are. We were getting worried about you. How \\nwas your walk?”\\nI wonder what \\nput him in such a good mood? Why doesn’t he just come out and ask how Saphira \\nis?“Pleasant, \\nbut the guards almost locked me outside the city. And Teirm is big. I had \\ntrouble finding this house.”\\nJeod chuckled. \\n“When you have seen Dras-Leona, Gil’ead, or even Kuasta, you won’t be so easily \\nimpressed by this small ocean city. I like it here, though. When it’s not \\nraining, Teirm is really quite beautiful.”\\nEragon turned to \\nBrom. “Do you have any idea how long we’ll be here?”\\nBrom spread his \\npalms upward. “That’s hard to tell. It depends on whether we can get to the \\nrecords and how long it will take us to find what we need. We’ll all have to \\nhelp; it will be a huge job. I’ll talk with Brand tomorrow and see if he’ll let \\nus examine the records.”\\n“I don’t think \\nI’ll be able to help,” Eragon said, shifting uneasily.\\n“Why not?” asked \\nBrom. “There will be plenty of work for you.”\\nEragon lowered \\nhis head. “I can’t read.”\\nBrom \\nstraightened with disbelief. “You mean Garrow never taught you?”\\n“He knew how to \\nread?” asked Eragon, puzzled. Jeod watched them with interest.\\n“Of course he \\ndid,” snorted Brom. “The proud fool—what was he thinking? I should have \\nrealized that he wouldn’t have taught you. He probably considered it an \\nunnecessary luxury.” Brom scowled and pulled at his beard angrily. “This sets \\nmy plans back, but not irreparably. I’ll just have to teach you how to read. It \\nwon’t take long if you put your mind to it.”\\nEragon winced. \\nBrom’s lessons were usually intense and brutally direct.How much more can I \\nlearn at one time? “I suppose it’s necessary,” he said ruefully.\\n“You’ll enjoy \\nit. There is much you can learn from books and scrolls,” said Jeod. He gestured \\nat the walls. “These books are my friends, my companions. They make me laugh \\nand cry and find meaning in life.”\\n“It sounds \\nintriguing,” admitted Eragon.\\n“Always the \\nscholar, aren’t you?” asked Brom.\\nJeod shrugged. \\n“Not anymore. I’m afraid I’ve degenerated into a bibliophile.”\\n“A what?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“One who loves \\nbooks,” explained Jeod, and resumed conversing with Brom. Bored, Eragon scanned \\nthe shelves. An elegant book set with gold studs caught his attention. He \\npulled it off the shelf and stared at it curiously.\\nIt was bound in \\nblack leather carved with mysterious runes. Eragon ran his fingers over the \\ncover and savored its cool smoothness. The letters inside were printed with a \\nreddish glossy ink. He let the pages slip past his fingers. A column of script, \\nset off from the regular lettering, caught his eye. The words were long and \\nflowing, full of graceful lines and sharp points.\\nEragon took the \\nbook to Brom. “What is this?” he asked, pointing to the strange writing.\\nBrom looked at \\nthe page closely and raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Jeod, you’ve expanded \\nyour collection. Where did you get this? I haven’t seen one in ages.”\\nJeod strained \\nhis neck to see the book. “Ah yes, theDomia abr Wyrda. A man came \\nthrough here a few years ago and tried to sell it to a trader down by the \\nwharves. Fortunately, I happened to be there and was able to save the book, \\nalong with his neck. He didn’t have a clue what it was.”\\n“It’s odd, \\nEragon, that you should pick up this book, theDominance of Fate, ” said \\nBrom. “Of all the items in this house, it’s probably worth the most. It details \\na complete history of Alagaësia—starting long before the elves landed here and \\nending a few decades ago. The book is very rare and is the best of its kind. \\nWhen it was written, the Empire decried it as blasphemy and burned the author, \\nHeslant the Monk. I didn’t think any copies still existed. The lettering you \\nasked about is from the ancient language.”\\n“What does it \\nsay?” asked Eragon.\\nIt took Brom a \\nmoment to read the writing. “It’s part of an elven poem that tells of the years \\nthey fought the dragons. This excerpt describes one of their kings, Ceranthor, \\nas he rides into battle. The elves love this poem and tell it regularly—though \\nyou need three days to do it properly—so that they won’t repeat the mistakes of \\nthe past. At times they sing it so beautifully it seems the very rocks will cry.”\\nEragon returned \\nto his chair, holding the book gently.It’s amazing that a man who is dead \\ncan talk to people through these pages. As long as this book survives, his \\nideas live. I wonder if it contains any information about the Ra’zac?\\nHe browsed through \\nthe book while Brom and Jeod spoke. Hours passed, and Eragon began to drowse. \\nOut of pity for his exhaustion, Jeod bid them good night. “The butler will show \\nyou to your rooms.”\\nOn the way \\nupstairs, the servant said, “If you need assistance, use the bellpull next to \\nthe bed.” He stopped before a cluster of three doors, bowed, then backed away.\\nAs Brom entered \\nthe room on the right, Eragon asked, “Can I talk to you?”\\n“You just did, \\nbut come in anyway.”\\nEragon closed \\nthe door behind himself. “Saphira and I had an idea. Is there—”\\nBrom stopped him \\nwith a raised hand and pulled the curtains shut over the window. “When you talk \\nof such things, you would do well to make sure that no unwelcome ears are \\npresent.”\\n“Sorry,” said \\nEragon, berating himself for the slip. “Anyway, is it possible to conjure up an \\nimage of something that you can’t see?”\\nBrom sat on the \\nedge of his bed. “What you are talking about is called scrying. It is quite \\npossible and extremely helpful in some situations, but it has a major drawback. \\nYou can only observe people, places, and things that you’ve already seen. If \\nyou were to scry the Ra’zac, you’d see them all right, but not their \\nsurroundings. There are other problems as well. Let’s say that you wanted to \\nview a page in a book, one that you’d already seen. You could only see the page \\nif the book were open to it. If the book were closed when you tried this, the \\npage would appear completely black.”\\n“Why can’t you \\nview objects that you haven’t seen?” asked Eragon. Even with those limitations, \\nhe realized, scrying could be very useful.I wonder if I could view something \\nleagues away and use magic to affect what was happening there?\\n“Because,” said \\nBrom patiently, “to scry, you have to know what you’re looking at and where to \\ndirect your power. Even if a stranger was described to you, it would still be \\nnigh impossible to view him, not to mention the ground and whatever else might \\nbe around him. You have to knowwhat you’re going to scry before youcan \\nscry it. Does that answer your question?”\\nEragon thought \\nfor a moment. “But how is it done? Do you conjure up the image in thin air?”\\n“Not usually,” \\nsaid Brom, shaking his white head. “That takes more energy than projecting it \\nonto a reflective surface like a pool of water or a mirror. Some Riders used to \\ntravel everywhere they could, trying to see as much as possible. Then, whenever \\nwar or some other calamity occurred, they would be able to view events \\nthroughout Alagaësia.”\\n“May I try it?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nBrom looked at \\nhim carefully. “No, not now. You’re tired, and scrying takes lots of strength. \\nI will tell you the words, but you must promise not to attempt it tonight. And \\nI’d rather you wait until we leave Teirm; I have more to teach you.”\\nEragon smiled. \\n“I promise.”\\n“Very well.” \\nBrom bent over and very quietly whispered, “Draumr kópa” into Eragon’s ear.\\nEragon took a \\nmoment to memorize the words. “Maybe after we’ve left Teirm, I can scry Roran. \\nI would like to know how he’s doing. I’m afraid that the Ra’zac might go after \\nhim.”\\n“I don’t mean to \\nfrighten you, but that’s a distinct possibility,” said Brom. “Although Roran \\nwas gone most of the time the Ra’zac were in Carvahall, I’m sure that they \\nasked questions about him. Who knows, they may have even met him while they \\nwere in Therinsford. Either way, I doubt their curiosity is sated. You’re on \\nthe loose, after all, and the king is probably threatening them with terrible \\npunishment if you aren’t found. If they get frustrated enough, they’ll go back \\nand interrogate Roran. It’s only a matter of time.”\\n“If that’s true, \\nthen the only way to keep Roran safe is to let the Ra’zac know where I am so \\nthat they’ll come after me instead of him.”\\n“No, that won’t \\nwork either. You’re not thinking,” admonished Brom. “If you can’t understand \\nyour enemies, how can you expect to anticipate them? Even if you exposed your \\nlocation, the Ra’zac wouldstill chase Roran. Do you know why?”\\nEragon \\nstraightened and tried to consider every possibility. “Well, if I stay in \\nhiding long enough, they might get frustrated and capture Roran to force me to \\nreveal myself. If that didn’t work, they’d kill him just to hurt me. Also, if I \\nbecome a public enemy of the Empire, they might use him as bait to catch me. \\nAnd if I met with Roran and they found out about it, they would torture him to \\nfind out where I was.”\\n“Very good. You \\nfigured that out quite nicely,” said Brom.\\n“But what’s the \\nsolution? I can’t let him be killed!”\\nBrom clasped his \\nhands loosely. “The solution is quite obvious. Roran is going to have to learn \\nhow to defend himself. That may sound hard-hearted, but as you pointed out, you \\ncannot risk meeting with him. You may not remember this—you were half delirious \\nat the time—but when we left Carvahall, I told you that I had left a warning \\nletter for Roran so he won’t be totally unprepared for danger. If he has any \\nsense at all, when the Ra’zac show up in Carvahall again, he’ll take my advice \\nand flee.”\\n“I don’t like \\nthis,” said Eragon unhappily.\\n“Ah, but you \\nforget something.”\\n“What?” he \\ndemanded.\\n“There is some \\ngood in all of this. The king cannot afford to have a Rider roaming around that \\nhe does not control. Galbatorix is the only known Rider alive besides yourself, \\nbut he would like another one under his command. Before he tries to kill you or \\nRoran, he will offer you the chance to serve him. Unfortunately, if he ever \\ngets close enough to make that proposition, it will be far too late for you to \\nrefuse and still live.”\\n“You call that \\nsome good!”\\n“It’s all that’s \\nprotecting Roran. As long as the king doesn’t know which side you’ve chosen, he \\nwon’t risk alienating you by harming your cousin. Keep that firmly in mind. The \\nRa’zac killed Garrow, but I think it was an ill-considered decision on their \\npart. From what I know of Galbatorix, he would not have approved it unless he \\ngained something from it.”\\n“And how will I \\nbe able to deny the king’s wishes when he is threatening me with death?” asked \\nEragon sharply.\\nBrom sighed. He \\nwent to his nightstand and dipped his fingers in a basin of rose water. \\n“Galbatorix wants your willing cooperation. Without that, you’re worse than \\nuseless to him. So the question becomes, If you are ever faced with this \\nchoice, are you willing to die for what you believe in? For that is the only \\nway you will deny him.”\\nThe question \\nhung in the air.\\nBrom finally \\nsaid, “It’s a difficult question and not one you can answer until you’re faced \\nwith it. Keep in mind that many people have died for their beliefs; it’s \\nactually quite common. The real courage is in living and suffering for what you \\nbelieve.”\\nT HEWITCH \\nANDTHEWERECAT\\nIt was late in \\nthe morning when Eragon woke. He dressed, washed his face in the basin, then \\nheld the mirror up and brushed his hair into place. Something about his \\nreflection made him stop and look closer. His face had changed since he had run \\nout of Carvahall just a short while ago. Any baby fat was gone now, stripped \\naway by traveling, sparring, and training. His cheekbones were more prominent, \\nand the line of his jaw was sharper. There was a slight cast to his eyes that, \\nwhen he looked closely, gave his face a wild, alien appearance. He held the \\nmirror at arm’s length, and his face resumed its normal semblance—but it still \\ndid not seem quite his own.\\nA little \\ndisturbed, he slung his bow and quiver across his back, then left the room. \\nBefore he had reached the end of the hall, the butler caught up with him and \\nsaid, “Sir, Neal left with my master for the castle earlier. He said that you \\ncould do whatever you want today because he will not return until this \\nevening.”\\nEragon thanked \\nhim for the message, then eagerly began exploring Teirm. For hours he wandered \\nthe streets, entering every shop that struck his fancy and chatting with \\nvarious people. Eventually he was forced back to Jeod’s by his empty stomach \\nand lack of money.\\nWhen he reached \\nthe street where the merchant lived, he stopped at the herbalist’s shop next \\ndoor. It was an unusual place for a store. The other shops were down by the \\ncity wall, not crammed between expensive houses. He tried to look in the \\nwindows, but they were covered with a thick layer of crawling plants on the \\ninterior. Curious, he went inside.\\nAt first he saw \\nnothing because the store was so dark, but then his eyes adjusted to the faint \\ngreenish light that filtered through the windows. A colorful bird with wide \\ntail feathers and a sharp, powerful beak looked at Eragon inquisitively from a \\ncage near the window. The walls were covered with plants; vines clung to the \\nceiling, obscuring all but an old chandelier, and on the floor was a large pot \\nwith a yellow flower. A collection of mortars, pestles, metal bowls, and a \\nclear crystal ball the size of Eragon’s head rested on a long counter.\\nHe walked to the \\ncounter, carefully stepping around complex machines, crates of rocks, piles of \\nscrolls, and other objects he did not recognize. The wall behind the counter \\nwas covered with drawers of every size. Some of them were no larger than his \\nsmallest finger, while others were big enough for a barrel. There was a \\nfoot-wide gap in the shelves far above.\\nA pair of red \\neyes suddenly flashed from the dark space, and a large, fierce cat leapt onto \\nthe counter. It had a lean body with powerful shoulders and oversized paws. A \\nshaggy mane surrounded its angular face; its ears were tipped with black tufts. \\nWhite fangs curved down over its jaw. Altogether, it did not look like any cat \\nEragon had ever seen. It inspected him with shrewd eyes, then flicked its tail \\ndismissively.\\nOn a whim, \\nEragon reached out with his mind and touched the cat’s consciousness. Gently, \\nhe prodded it with his thoughts, trying to make it understand that he was a \\nfriend.\\nYou don’t have \\nto do that.\\n\\nEragon looked \\naround in alarm. The cat ignored him and licked a paw.Saphira? Where are \\nyou? he asked. No one answered. Puzzled, he leaned against the counter and \\nreached for what looked like a wood rod.\\nThat wouldn’t be \\nwise.\\n\\nStop playing \\ngames, Saphira,he \\nsnapped, then picked up the rod. A shock of electricity exploded through his \\nbody, and he fell to the floor, writhing. The pain slowly faded, leaving him \\ngasping for air. The cat jumped down and looked at him.\\nYou aren’t very \\nsmart for a Dragon Rider. I did warn you. \\nYou said that!exclaimed \\nEragon. The cat yawned, then stretched and sauntered across the floor, weaving \\nits way between objects.\\nWho else? \\nBut you’re just \\na cat!he \\nobjected.\\nThe cat yowled \\nand stalked back to him. It jumped on his chest and crouched there, looking \\ndown at him with gleaming eyes. Eragon tried to sit up, but it growled, showing \\nits fangs.Do I look like other cats?\\nNo . . . \\nThen what makes \\nyou think I am one?Eragon \\nstarted to say something, but the creature dug its claws into his chest.Obviously \\nyour education has been neglected. I—to correct your mistake—am a werecat. \\nThere aren’t many of us left, but I think even a farm boy should have heard of \\nus.\\nI didn’t know \\nyou were real,said \\nEragon, fascinated. A werecat! He was indeed fortunate. They were always \\nflitting around the edges of stories, keeping to themselves and occasionally \\ngiving advice. If the legends were true, they had magical powers, lived longer \\nthan humans, and usually knew more than they told.\\nThe werecat \\nblinked lazily.Knowing is independent of being. I did not know you existed \\nbefore you bumbled in here and ruined my nap. Yet that doesn’t mean you weren’t \\nreal before you woke me.\\nEragon was lost \\nby its reasoning.I’m sorry I disturbed you.\\nI was getting up \\nanyway,it \\nsaid. It leapt back onto the counter and licked its paw.If I were you, I \\nwouldn’t hold on to that rod much longer. It’s going to shock you again in a \\nfew seconds.\\nHe hastily put \\nthe rod back where he had found it.What is it?\\nA common and \\nboring artifact, unlike myself. \\nBut what’s it \\nfor?\\n\\nDidn’t you find \\nout?The \\nwerecat finished cleaning its paw, stretched once more, then jumped back up to \\nits sleeping place. It sat down, tucked its paws under its breast, and closed \\nits eyes, purring.\\nWait,said Eragon,what’s \\nyour name?\\nOne of the \\nwerecat’s slanted eyes cracked open.I go by many names. If you are looking \\nfor my proper one, you will have to seek elsewhere. The eye closed. Eragon \\ngave up and turned to leave.However, you may call me Solembum.\\nThank you,said Eragon \\nseriously. Solembum’s purring grew louder.\\nThe door to the \\nshop swung open, letting in a beam of sunlight. Angela entered with a cloth bag \\nfull of plants. Her eyes flickered at Solembum and she looked startled. “He \\nsays you talked with him.”\\n“You can talk \\nwith him, too?” asked Eragon.\\nShe tossed her \\nhead. “Of course, but that doesn’t mean he’ll say anything back.” She set her \\nplants on the counter, then walked behind it and faced him. “He likes you. \\nThat’s unusual. Most of the time Solembum doesn’t show himself to customers. In \\nfact, he says that you show some promise, given a few years of work.”\\n“Thanks.”\\n“It’s a \\ncompliment, coming from him. You’re only the third person to come in here who \\nhas been able to speak with him. The first was a woman, many years ago; the second \\nwas a blind beggar; and now you. But I don’t run a store just so I can prattle \\non. Is there anything you want? Or did you only come in to look?”\\n“Just to look,” \\nsaid Eragon, still thinking about the werecat. “Besides, I don’t really need \\nany herbs.”\\n“That’s not all \\nI do,” said Angela with a grin. “The rich fool lords pay me for love potions \\nand the like. I never claim that they work, but for some reason they keep \\ncoming back. But I don’t think you need those chicaneries. Would you like your \\nfortune told? I do that, too, for all the rich fool ladies.”\\nEragon laughed. \\n“No, I’m afraid my fortune is pretty much unreadable. And I don’t have any \\nmoney.”\\nAngela looked at \\nSolembum curiously. “I think . . .” She gestured at the crystal ball resting on \\nthe counter. “That’s only for show anyway—it doesn’t do anything. But I do have \\n. . . Wait here; I’ll be right back.” She hurried into a room at the back of \\nthe shop.\\nShe came back, \\nbreathless, holding a leather pouch, which she set on the counter. “I haven’t \\nused these for so long, I almost forgot where they were. Now, sit across from \\nme and I’ll show you why I went to all this trouble.” Eragon found a stool and \\nsat. Solembum’s eyes glowed from the gap in the drawers.\\nAngela laid a \\nthick cloth on the counter, then poured a handful of smooth bones, each \\nslightly longer than a finger, onto it. Runes and symbols were inscribed along \\ntheir sides. “These,” she said, touching them gently, “are the knucklebones of \\na dragon. Don’t ask where I got them; it is a secret I won’t reveal. But unlike \\ntea leaves, crystal balls, or even divining cards, these have true power. They \\ndo not lie, though understanding what they say is . . . complicated. If you \\nwish, I will cast and read them for you. But understand that to know one’s fate \\ncan be a terrible thing. You must be sure of your decision.”\\nEragon looked at \\nthe bones with a feeling of dread.There lies what was once one of Saphira’s \\nkin. To know one’s fate . . . How can I make this decision when I don’t know \\nwhat lies in wait for me and whether I will like it?Ignorance is indeed bliss. \\n“Why do you offer this?” he asked.\\n“Because of \\nSolembum. He may have been rude, but the fact that he spoke to you makes you \\nspecial. Heis a werecat, after all. I offered to do this for the other \\ntwo people who talked with him. Only the woman agreed to it. Selena was her \\nname. Ah, she regretted it, too. Her fortune was bleak and painful. I don’t \\nthink she believed it—not at first.”\\nEmotion overcame \\nEragon, bringing tears to his eyes. “Selena,” he whispered to himself. His \\nmother’s name.Could it have been her? Was her destiny so horrible that she \\nhad to abandon me? “Do you remember anything about her fortune?” he asked, \\nfeeling sick.\\nAngela shook her \\nhead and sighed. “It was so long ago that the details have melted into the rest \\nof my memory, which isn’t as good as it used to be. Besides, I’ll not tell you \\nwhat I do remember. That was for her and her alone. It was sad, though; I’ve \\nnever forgotten the look on her face.”\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes and struggled to regain control of his emotions. “Why do you complain \\nabout your memory?” he asked to distract himself. “You’re not that old.”\\nDimples appeared \\non Angela’s cheeks. “I’m flattered, but don’t be deceived; I’m much older than \\nI look. The appearance of youth probably comes from having to eat my own herbs \\nwhen times are lean.”\\nSmiling, Eragon \\ntook a deep breath.If that was my mother and she could bear to have her \\nfortune told, I can too. “Cast the bones for me,” he said solemnly.\\nAngela’s face \\nbecame grave as she grasped the bones in each hand. Her eyes closed, and her \\nlips moved in a soundless murmur. Then she said powerfully,“Manin! Wyrda! \\nHugin!” and tossed the bones onto the cloth. They fell all jumbled \\ntogether, gleaming in the faint light.\\nThe words rang \\nin Eragon’s ears; he recognized them from the ancient language and realized \\nwith apprehension that to use them for magic, Angela must be a witch. She had \\nnot lied; this was a true fortunetelling. Minutes slowly passed as she studied \\nthe bones.\\nFinally, Angela \\nleaned back and heaved a long sigh. She wiped her brow and pulled out a \\nwineskin from under the counter. “Do you want some?” she asked. Eragon shook \\nhis head. She shrugged and drank deeply. “This,” she said, wiping her mouth, \\n“is the hardest reading I’ve ever done. You were right. Your future is nigh \\nimpossible to see. I’ve never known of anyone’s fate being so tangled and \\nclouded. I was, however, able to wrestle a few answers from it.”\\nSolembum jumped \\nonto the counter and settled there, watching them both. Eragon clenched his \\nhands as Angela pointed to one of the bones. “I will start here,” she said \\nslowly, “because it is the clearest to understand.”\\nThe symbol on \\nthe bone was a long horizontal line with a circle resting on it. “Infinity or \\nlong life,” said Angela quietly. “This is the first time I have ever seen it \\ncome up in someone’s future. Most of the time it’s the aspen or the elm, both \\nsigns that a person will live a normal span of years. Whether this means that \\nyou will live forever or that you will only have an extraordinarily long life, \\nI’m not sure. Whatever it foretells, you may be sure that many years lie ahead \\nof you.”\\nNo surprises \\nthere—I am a Rider,thought \\nEragon. Was Angela only going to tell him things he already knew?\\n“Now the bones \\ngrow harder to read, as the rest are in a confused pile.” Angela touched three \\nof them. “Here the wandering path, lightning bolt, and sailing ship all lie \\ntogether—a pattern I’ve never seen, only heard of. The wandering path shows \\nthat there are many choices in your future, some of which you face even now. I \\nsee great battles raging around you, some of them fought for your sake. I see \\nthe mighty powers of this land struggling to control your will and destiny. \\nCountless possible futures await you—all of them filled with blood and \\nconflict—but only one will bring you happiness and peace. Beware of losing your \\nway, for you are one of the few who are truly free to choose their own fate. \\nThat freedom is a gift, but it is also a responsibility more binding than chains.”\\nThen her face \\ngrew sad. “And yet, as if to counteract that, here is the lightning bolt. It is \\na terrible omen. There is a doom upon you, but of what sort I know not. Part of \\nit lies in a death—one that rapidly approaches and will cause you much grief. \\nBut the rest awaits in a great journey. Look closely at this bone. You can see \\nhow its end rests on that of the sailing ship. That is impossible to \\nmisunderstand. Your fate will be to leave this land forever. Where you will end \\nup I know not, but you will never again stand in Alagaësia. This is \\ninescapable. It will come to pass even if you try to avoid it.”\\nHer words \\nfrightened Eragon.Another death . . . who must I lose now? His thoughts \\nimmediately went to Roran. Then he thought about his homeland.What could \\never force me to leave?And where would I go? If there are lands across the sea \\nor to the east, only the elves know of them.\\nAngela rubbed \\nher temples and breathed deeply. “The next bone is easier to read and perhaps a \\nbit more pleasant.” Eragon examined it and saw a rose blossom inscribed between \\nthe horns of a crescent moon.\\nAngela smiled \\nand said, “An epic romance is in your future, extraordinary, as the moon \\nindicates—for that is a magical symbol—and strong enough to outlast empires. I \\ncannot say if this passion will end happily, but your love is of noble birth \\nand heritage. She is powerful, wise, and beautiful beyond compare.”\\nOf noble birth,thought Eragon \\nin surprise.How could that ever happen? I have no more standing than the \\npoorest of farmers.\\n“Now for the \\nlast two bones, the tree and the hawthorn root, which cross each other \\nstrongly. I wish that this were not so—it can only mean more trouble—but \\nbetrayal is clear. And it will come from within your family.”\\n“Roran wouldn’t \\ndo that!” objected Eragon abruptly.\\n“I wouldn’t \\nknow,” said Angela carefully. “But the bones have never lied, and that is what \\nthey say.”\\nDoubt wormed \\ninto Eragon’s mind, but he tried to ignore it. What reason would there ever be \\nfor Roran to turn on him? Angela put a comforting hand on his shoulder and \\noffered him the wineskin again. This time Eragon accepted the drink, and it \\nmade him feel better.\\n“After all that, \\ndeath might be welcome,” he joked nervously.Betrayal from Roran? It couldn’t \\nhappen! It won’t!\\n“It might be,” \\nsaid Angela solemnly, then laughed slightly. “But you shouldn’t fret about what \\nhas yet to occur. The only way the future can harm us is by causing worry. I \\nguarantee that you’ll feel better once you’re out in the sun.”\\n“Perhaps.”Unfortunately, \\nhe reflected wryly,nothing she said will make sense until it has already \\nhappened. If it really does, he amended himself. “You used words of power,” \\nhe noted quietly.\\nAngela’s eyes \\nflashed. “What I wouldn’t give to see how the rest of your life plays out. You \\ncan speak to werecats, know of the ancient language, and have a most \\ninteresting future. Also, few young men with empty pockets and rough traveling \\nclothes can expect to be loved by a noblewoman. Who are you?”\\nEragon realized \\nthat the werecat must not have told Angela that he was a Rider. He almost said, \\n“Evan,” but then changed his mind and simply stated, “I am Eragon.”\\nAngela arched \\nher eyebrows. “Is that who you are or your name?” she asked.\\n“Both,” said \\nEragon with a small smile, thinking of his namesake, the first Rider.\\n“Now I’m all the \\nmore interested in seeing how your life will unfold. Who was the ragged man \\nwith you yesterday?”\\nEragon decided \\nthat one more name couldn’t hurt. “His name is Brom.”\\nA guffaw \\nsuddenly burst out of Angela, doubling her over in mirth. She wiped her eyes \\nand took a sip of wine, then fought off another attack of merriment. Finally, \\ngasping for breath, she forced out, “Oh . . . that one! I had no idea!”\\n“What is it?” \\ndemanded Eragon.\\n“No, no, don’t \\nbe upset,” said Angela, hiding a smile. “It’s only that—well, he is known by \\nthose in my profession. I’m afraid that the poor man’s doom, or future if you \\nwill, is something of a joke with us.”\\n“Don’t insult \\nhim! He’s a better man than any you could find!” snapped Eragon.\\n“Peace, peace,” \\nchided Angela with amusement. “I know that. If we meet again at the right time \\nI’ll be sure to tell you about it. But in the meantime you should—” She stopped \\nspeaking as Solembum padded between them. The werecat stared at Eragon with \\nunblinking eyes.\\nYes?Eragon asked, \\nirritated.\\nListen closely \\nand I will tell you two things. When the time comes and you need a weapon, look \\nunder the roots of the Menoa tree. Then, when all seems lost and your power is \\ninsufficient, go to the rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault \\nof Souls.\\n\\nBefore Eragon \\ncould ask what Solembum meant, the werecat walked away, waving his tail ever so \\ngracefully. Angela tilted her head, coils of dense hair shadowing her forehead. \\n“I don’t know what he said, and I don’t want to know. He spoke to you and only \\nyou. Don’t tell anyone else.”\\n“I think I have \\nto go,” said Eragon, shaken.\\n“If you want \\nto,” said Angela, smiling again. “You are welcome to stay here as long as you \\nlike, especially if you buy some of my goods. But go if you wish; I’m sure that \\nwe’ve given you enough to ponder for a while.”\\n“Yes.” Eragon \\nquickly made his way to the door. “Thank you for reading my future.”I think.\\n“You’re \\nwelcome,” said Angela, still smiling.\\nEragon exited \\nthe shop and stood in the street, squinting until his eyes adjusted to the \\nbrightness. It was a few minutes before he could think calmly about what he had \\nlearned. He started walking, his steps unconsciously quickening until he dashed \\nout of Teirm, feet flying as he headed to Saphira’s hiding place.\\nHe called to her \\nfrom the base of the cliff. A minute later she soared down and bore him up to \\nthe cliff top. When they were both safely on the ground, Eragon told her about \\nhis day.And so, he concluded,I think Brom’s right; I always seem to \\nbe where there’s trouble.\\nYou should \\nremember what the werecat told you. It’s important. \\nHow do you know?he asked \\ncuriously.\\nI’m not sure, \\nbut the names he used feel powerful.Kuthian, she said, rolling the word \\naround.No, we should not forget what he said.\\nDo you think I \\nshould tell Brom?\\n\\nIt’s your \\nchoice, but think of this: he has no right to know your future. To tell him of \\nSolembum and his words will only raise questions you may not want to answer. \\nAnd if you decided to only ask him what those words mean, he will want to know \\nwhere you learned them. Do you think you can lie convincingly to him? \\nNo,admitted Eragon.Maybe \\nI won’t say anything. Still, this might be too important to hide. They \\ntalked until there was nothing more to say. Then they sat together \\ncompanionably, watching the trees until dusk.\\nEragon hurried \\nback to Teirm and was soon knocking on Jeod’s door. “Is Neal back?” he asked \\nthe butler.\\n“Yes sir. I \\nbelieve he’s in the study right now.”\\n“Thank you,” said \\nEragon. He strode to the room and peeked inside. Brom was sitting before the \\nfire, smoking. “How did it go?” asked Eragon.\\n“Bloody awful!” \\ngrowled Brom around his pipe.\\n“So you talked \\nto Brand?”\\n“Not that it did \\nany good. Thisadministrator of trade is the worst sort of bureaucrat. He \\nabides by every rule, delights in making his own whenever it can inconvenience \\nsomeone, and at the same time believes that he’s doing good.”\\n“Then he won’t \\nlet us see the records?” asked Eragon.\\n“No,” snapped \\nBrom, exasperated. “Nothing I could say would sway him. He even refused bribes! \\nSubstantial ones, too. I didn’t think I would ever meet a noble who wasn’t \\ncorrupt. Now that I have, I find that I prefer them when they’re greedy \\nbastards.” He puffed furiously on his pipe and mumbled a steady stream of \\ncurses.\\nWhen he seemed \\nto have calmed, Eragon asked tentatively, “So, what now?”\\n“I’m going to \\ntake the next week and teach you how to read.”\\n“And after \\nthat?”\\nA smile split \\nBrom’s face. “After that, we’re going to give Brand a nasty surprise.” Eragon \\npestered him for details, but Brom refused to say more.\\nDinner was held \\nin a sumptuous dining room. Jeod sat at one end of the table, a hard-eyed Helen \\nat the other. Brom and Eragon were seated between them, which Eragon felt was a \\ndangerous place to be. Empty chairs were on either side of him, but he didn’t \\nmind the space. It helped to protect him from the glares of their hostess.\\nThe food was \\nserved quietly, and Jeod and Helen wordlessly began eating. Eragon followed \\nsuit, thinking,I’ve had cheerier meals at funerals. And he had, in \\nCarvahall. He remembered many burials that had been sad, yes, but not unduly \\nso. This was different; he could feel simmering resentment pouring from Helen \\nthroughout the dinner.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 28': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nO FREADING ANDPLOTS\\nBrom scratched a \\nrune on parchment with charcoal, then showed it to Eragon. “This is the lettera, \\n” he said. “Learn it.”\\nWith that, \\nEragon began the task of becoming literate. It was difficult and strange and \\npushed his intellect to its limits, but he enjoyed it. Without anything else to \\ndo and with a good—if sometimes impatient—teacher, he advanced rapidly.\\nA routine was \\nsoon established. Every day Eragon got up, ate in the kitchen, then went to the \\nstudy for his lessons, where he labored to memorize the sounds of the letters \\nand the rules of writing. It got so that when he closed his eyes, letters and \\nwords danced in his mind. He thought of little else during that time.\\nBefore dinner, \\nhe and Brom would go behind Jeod’s house and spar. The servants, along with a \\nsmall crowd of wide-eyed children, would come and watch. If there was any time \\nafterward, Eragon would practice magic in his room, with the curtains securely \\nclosed.\\nHis only worry \\nwas Saphira. He visited her every evening, but it was not enough time together \\nfor either of them. During the day, Saphira spent most of her time leagues away \\nsearching for food; she could not hunt near Teirm without arousing suspicion. \\nEragon did what he could to help her, but he knew that the only solution for \\nboth her hunger and loneliness was to leave the city far behind.\\nEvery day more \\ngrim news poured into Teirm. Arriving merchants told of horrific attacks along \\nthe coast. There were reports of powerful people disappearing from their houses \\nin the night and their mangled corpses being discovered in the morning. Eragon \\noften heard Brom and Jeod discussing the events in an undertone, but they \\nalways stopped when he came near.\\nThe days passed \\nquickly, and soon a week had gone by. Eragon’s skills were rudimentary, but he \\ncould now read whole pages without asking Brom’s help. He read slowly, but he \\nknew that speed would come with time. Brom encouraged him, “No matter, you’ll \\ndo fine for what I have planned.”\\nIt was afternoon \\nwhen Brom summoned both Jeod and Eragon to the study. Brom gestured at Eragon. \\n“Now that you can help us, I think it’s time to move ahead.”\\n“What do you \\nhave in mind?” asked Eragon.\\nA fierce smile \\ndanced on Brom’s face. Jeod groaned. “I know that look; it’s what got us into \\ntrouble in the first place.”\\n“A slight \\nexaggeration,” said Brom, “but not unwarranted. Very well, this is what we’ll \\ndo. . . .”\\n\\xa0\\nWe leave tonight \\nor tomorrow,Eragon \\ntold Saphira from within his room.\\nThis is \\nunexpected. Will you be safe during this venture? \\nEragon shrugged.I \\ndon’t know. We may end up fleeing Teirm with soldiers on our heels. He felt \\nher worry and tried to reassure her.It’ll be all right. Brom and I can use \\nmagic, and we’re good fighters.\\nHe lay on the \\nbed and stared at the ceiling. His hands shook slightly, and there was a lump \\nin his throat. As sleep overcame him, he felt a wave of confusion.I don’t \\nwant to leave Teirm, he suddenly realized.The time I’ve spent here has \\nbeen—almost normal. What I would give not to keep uprooting myself. To stay \\nhere and be like everyone else would be wonderful. Then, another thought \\nraged through him,But I’ll never be able to while Saphira is around. Never.\\nDreams owned his \\nconsciousness, twisting and directing it to their whims. At times he quaked \\nwith fear; at others he laughed with pleasure. Then something changed—it was as \\nthough his eyes had been opened for the first time—and a dream came to him that \\nwas clearer than any before.\\nHe saw a young \\nwoman, bent over by sorrow, chained in a cold, hard cell. A beam of moonlight \\nshone through a barred window set high in the wall and fell on her face. A \\nsingle tear rolled down her cheek, like a liquid diamond. \\nEragon rose with \\na start and found himself crying uncontrollably before sinking back into a \\nfitful sleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 29': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HIEVES IN THECASTLE\\nEragon woke from \\nhis nap to a golden sunset. Red and orange beams of light streamed into the \\nroom and fell across the bed. They warmed his back pleasantly, making him \\nreluctant to move. He dozed, but the sunlight crept off him, and he grew cold. \\nThe sun sank below the horizon, lighting the sea and sky with color.Almost \\ntime!\\nHe slung his bow \\nand quiver on his back, but left Zar’roc in the room; the sword would only slow \\nhim, and he was averse to using it. If he had to disable someone, he could use \\nmagic or an arrow. He pulled his jerkin over his shirt and laced it securely.\\nHe waited \\nnervously in his room until the light faded. Then he entered the hallway and \\nshrugged so the quiver settled comfortably across his back. Brom joined him, \\ncarrying his sword and staff.\\nJeod, dressed in \\na black doublet and hose, was waiting for them outside. From his waist swung an \\nelegant rapier and a leather pouch. Brom eyed the rapier and observed, “That \\ntoad sticker is too thin for any real fighting. What will you do if someone \\ncomes after you with a broadsword or a flamberge?”\\n“Be realistic,” \\nsaid Jeod. “None of the guards has a flamberge. Besides, thistoad sticker \\nis faster than a broadsword.”\\nBrom shrugged. \\n“It’s your neck.”\\nThey walked \\ncasually along the street, avoiding watchmen and soldiers. Eragon was tense and \\nhis heart pounded. As they passed Angela’s shop, a flash of movement on the \\nroof caught his attention, but he saw no one. His palm tingled. He looked at \\nthe roof again, but it was still empty.\\nBrom led them \\nalong Teirm’s outer wall. By the time they reached the castle, the sky was \\nblack. The sealed walls of the fortress made Eragon shiver. He would hate to be \\nimprisoned there. Jeod silently took the lead and strode up to the gates, \\ntrying to look at ease. He pounded on the gate and waited.\\nA small grille \\nslid open and a surly guard peered out. “Ya?” he grunted shortly. Eragon could \\nsmell rum on his breath.\\n“We need to get \\nin,” said Jeod.\\nThe guard peered \\nat Jeod closer. “Wha’ for?”\\n“The boy here \\nleft something very valuable in my office. We have to retrieve it immediately.” \\nEragon hung his head, shamefaced.\\nThe guard \\nfrowned, clearly impatient to get back to his bottle. “Ah, wha’ever,” he said, \\nswinging his arm. “Jus’ make sure ’n give ’im a good beating f’r me.”\\n“I’ll do that,” \\nassured Jeod as the guard unbolted a small door set into the gate. They entered \\nthe keep, then Brom handed the guard a few coins.\\n“Thank’ee,” \\nmumbled the man, tottering away. As soon as he was gone, Eragon pulled his bow \\nfrom its tube and strung it. Jeod quickly let them into the main part of the \\ncastle. They hurried toward their destination, listening carefully for any \\nsoldiers on patrol. At the records room, Brom tried the door. It was locked. He \\nput his hand against the door and muttered a word that Eragon did not \\nrecognize. It swung open with a faint click. Brom grabbed a torch from the wall, \\nand they darted inside, closing the door quietly.\\nThe squat room \\nwas filled with wooden racks piled high with scrolls. A barred window was set \\nin the far wall. Jeod threaded his way between the racks, running his eyes over \\nthe scrolls. He halted at the back of the room. “Over here,” he said. “These \\nare the shipping records for the past five years. You can tell the date by the \\nwax seals on the corner.”\\n“So what do we \\ndo now?” asked Eragon, pleased that they had made it so far without being \\ndiscovered.\\n“Start at the \\ntop and work down,” said Jeod. “Some scrolls only deal with taxes. You can \\nignore those. Look for anything that mentions Seithr oil.” He took a length of \\nparchment from his pouch and stretched it out on the floor, then set a bottle \\nof ink and a quill pen next to it. “So we can keep track of whatever we find,” \\nhe explained.\\nBrom scooped an \\narmful of scrolls from the top of the rack and piled them on the floor. He sat \\nand unrolled the first one. Eragon joined him, positioning himself so he could \\nsee the door. The tedious work was especially difficult for him, as the cramped \\nscript on the scrolls was different from the printing Brom had taught him.\\nBy looking only \\nfor the names of ships that sailed in the northern areas, they winnowed out \\nmany of the scrolls. Even so, they moved down the rack slowly, recording each \\nshipment of Seithr oil as they located it.\\nIt was quiet \\noutside the room, except for the occasional watchman. Suddenly, Eragon’s neck \\nprickled. He tried to keep working, but the uneasy feeling remained. Irritated, \\nhe looked up and jerked with surprise—a small boy crouched on the windowsill. \\nHis eyes were slanted, and a sprig of holly was woven into his shaggy black \\nhair.\\nDo you need \\nhelp?asked \\na voice in Eragon’s head. His eyes widened with shock. It sounded like \\nSolembum.\\nIs that you?he asked \\nincredulously.\\nAm I someone \\nelse?\\n\\nEragon gulped \\nand concentrated on his scroll. If my eyes don’t deceive me, you are.\\nThe boy smiled \\nslightly, revealing pointed teeth.What I look like doesn’t change who I am. \\nYou don’t think I’m called a werecat for nothing, do you?\\nWhat are you \\ndoing here?Eragon \\nasked.\\nThe werecat \\ntilted his head and considered whether the question was worth an answer.That \\ndepends on what you are doing here. If you are reading those scrolls for \\nentertainment, then I suppose there isn’t any reason for my visit. But if what \\nyou are doing is unlawful and you don’t want to be discovered, I might be here \\nto warn you that the guard whom you bribed just told his replacement about you \\nand that this second official of the Empire has sent soldiers to search for \\nyou.\\nThank you for \\ntelling me,said \\nEragon.\\nTold you \\nsomething, did I? I suppose I did. And I suggest you make use of it. \\nThe boy stood \\nand tossed back his wild hair. Eragon asked quickly,What did you mean last \\ntime about the tree and the vault?\\nExactly what I \\nsaid.\\n\\nEragon tried to \\nask more, but the werecat vanished through the window. He announced abruptly, \\n“There are soldiers looking for us.”\\n“How do you \\nknow?” asked Brom sharply.\\n“I listened in \\non the guard. His replacement just sent men to search for us. We have to get \\nout of here. They’ve probably already discovered that Jeod’s office is empty.”\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Jeod.\\n“Yes!” said \\nEragon impatiently. “They’re on their way.”\\nBrom snatched \\nanother scroll from the rack. “No matter. We have to finish this now!” They \\nworked furiously for the next minute, scanning the records as fast as they \\ncould. As the last scroll was finished, Brom threw it back onto the rack, and \\nJeod jammed his parchment, ink, and pen into his pouch. Eragon grabbed the \\ntorch.\\nThey raced from \\nthe room and shut the door, but just as it closed they heard the heavy tramp of \\nsoldiers’ boots at the end of the hall. They turned to leave, but Brom hissed \\nfuriously, “Damnation! It’s not locked.” He put his hand against the door. The \\nlock clicked at the same time three armed soldiers came into view.\\n“Hey! Get away \\nfrom that door!” shouted one of them. Brom stepped back, assuming a surprised \\nexpression. The three men marched up to them. The tallest one demanded, “Why \\nare you trying to get into the records?” Eragon gripped his bow tighter and \\nprepared to run.\\n“I’m afraid we \\nlost our way.” The strain was evident in Jeod’s voice. A drop of sweat rolled \\ndown his neck.\\nThe soldier glared \\nat them suspiciously. “Check inside the room,” he ordered one of his men.\\nEragon held his \\nbreath as the soldier stepped up to the door, tried to open it, then pounded on \\nit with his mailed fist. “It’s locked, sir.”\\nThe leader \\nscratched his chin. “Ar’right, then. I don’t know what you were up to, but as \\nlong as the door’s locked, I guess you’re free to go. Come on.” The soldiers \\nsurrounded them and marched them back to the keep.\\nI can’t believe \\nit,thought \\nEragon.They’re helping us get away!\\nAt the main \\ngates, the soldier pointed and said, “Now, you walk through those and don’t try \\nanything. We’ll be watching. If you have to come back, wait until morning.”\\n“Of course,” \\npromised Jeod.\\nEragon could \\nfeel the guards’ eyes boring into their backs as they hurried out of the \\ncastle. The moment that the gates closed behind them, a triumphant grin \\nstretched across his face, and he jumped into the air. Brom shot him a \\ncautioning look and growled, “Walk back to the house normally. You can \\ncelebrate there.”\\nChastised, \\nEragon adopted a staid demeanor, but inside he still bubbled with energy. Once \\nthey had hurried back to the house and into the study, Eragon exclaimed, “We \\ndid it!”\\n“Yes, but now we \\nhave to figure out if it was worth the trouble,” said Brom. Jeod took a map of \\nAlagaësia from the shelves and unrolled it on the desk.\\nOn the left side \\nof the map, the ocean extended to the unknown west. Along the coast stretched \\nthe Spine, an immense length of mountains. The Hadarac Desert filled the center \\nof the map—the east end was blank. Somewhere in that void hid the Varden. To \\nthe south was Surda, a small country that had seceded from the Empire after the \\nRiders’ fall. Eragon had been told that Surda secretly supported the Varden.\\nNear Surda’s \\neastern border was a mountain range labeled Beor Mountains. Eragon had heard of \\nthem in many stories—they were supposed to be ten times the height of the \\nSpine, though he privately believed that was exaggeration. The map was empty to \\nthe east of the Beors.\\nFive islands \\nrested off the coast of Surda: Nía, Parlim, Uden, Illium, and Beirland. Nía was \\nno more than an outcropping of rock, but Beirland, the largest, had a small \\ntown. Farther up, near Teirm, was a jagged island called Sharktooth. And high \\nto the north was one more island, immense and shaped like a knobby hand. Eragon \\nknew its name without even looking: Vroengard, the ancestral home of the \\nRiders—once a place of glory, but now a looted, empty shell haunted by strange \\nbeasts. In the center of Vroengard was the abandoned city of Dorú Areaba.\\nCarvahall was a \\nsmall dot at the top of Palancar Valley. Level with it, but across the plains, \\nsprawled the forest Du Weldenvarden. Like the Beor Mountains, its eastern end \\nwas unmapped. Parts of Du Weldenvarden’s western edge had been settled, but its \\nheart lay mysterious and unexplored. The forest was wilder than the Spine; the \\nfew who braved its depths often came back raving mad, or not at all.\\nEragon shivered \\nas he saw Urû’baen in the center of the Empire. King Galbatorix ruled from \\nthere with his black dragon, Shruikan, by his side. Eragon put his finger on \\nUrû’baen. “The Ra’zac are sure to have a hiding place here.”\\n“You had better \\nhope that that isn’t their only sanctuary,” said Brom flatly. “Otherwise you’ll \\nnever get near them.” He pushed the rustling map flat with his wrinkled hands.\\nJeod took the \\nparchment out of his pouch and said, “From what I saw in the records, there \\nhave been shipments of Seithr oil to every major city in the Empire over the \\npast five years. As far as I can tell, all of them might have been ordered by \\nwealthy jewelers. I’m not sure how we can narrow down the list without more \\ninformation.”\\nBrom swept a \\nhand over the map. “I think we can eliminate some cities. The Ra’zac have to \\ntravel wherever the king wants, and I’m sure he keeps them busy. If they’re \\nexpected to go anywhere at anytime, the only reasonable place for them to stay \\nis at a crossroads where they can reach every part of the country fairly \\neasily.” He was excited now and paced the room. “This crossroads has to be \\nlarge enough so the Ra’zac will be inconspicuous. It also has to have enough \\ntrade so any unusual requests—special food for their mounts, for example—will \\ngo unnoticed.”\\n“That makes \\nsense,” said Jeod, nodding. “Under those conditions, we can ignore most of the \\ncities in the north. The only big ones are Teirm, Gil’ead, and Ceunon. I know \\nthey’re not in Teirm, and I doubt that the oil has been shipped farther up the \\ncoast to Narda—it’s too small. Ceunon is too isolated . . . only Gil’ead \\nremains.”\\n“The Ra’zac \\nmight be there,” conceded Brom. “It would have a certain irony.”\\n“It would at \\nthat,” Jeod acknowledged softly.\\n“What about \\nsouthern cities?” asked Eragon.\\n“Well,” said \\nJeod. “There’s obviously Urû’baen, but that’s an unlikely destination. If \\nsomeone were to die from Seithr oil in Galbatorix’s court, it would be all too \\neasy for an earl or some other lord to discover that the Empire had been buying \\nlarge amounts of it. That still leaves many others, any one of which could be \\nthe one we want.”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, “but the oil wasn’t sent to all of them. The parchment only lists \\nKuasta, Dras-Leona, Aroughs, and Belatona. Kuasta wouldn’t work for the Ra’zac; \\nit’s on the coast and surrounded by mountains. Aroughs is isolated like Ceunon, \\nthough it is a center of trade. That leaves Belatona and Dras-Leona, which are \\nrather close together. Of the two, I think Dras-Leona is the likelier. It’s \\nlarger and better situated.”\\n“And that’s \\nwhere nearly all the goods of the Empire pass through at one time or another, \\nincluding Teirm’s,” said Jeod. “It would be a good place for the Ra’zac to \\nhide.”\\n“So . . . \\nDras-Leona,” said Brom as he sat down and lit his pipe. “What do the records \\nshow?”\\nJeod looked at \\nthe parchment. “Here it is. At the beginning of the year, three shipments of \\nSeithr oil were sent to Dras-Leona. Each shipment was only two weeks apart, and \\nthe records say they were all transported by the same merchant. The same thing \\nhappened last year and the year before that. I doubt any one jeweler, or even a \\ngroup of them, has the money for so much oil.”\\n“What about \\nGil’ead?” asked Brom, raising an eyebrow.\\n“It doesn’t have \\nthe same access to the rest of the Empire. And,” Jeod tapped the parchment, \\n“they’ve only received the oil twice in recent years.” He thought for a moment, \\nthen said, “Besides, I think we forgot something—Helgrind.”\\nBrom nodded. “Ah \\nyes, the Dark Gates. It’s been many years since I’ve thought of it. You’re \\nright, that would make Dras-Leona perfect for the Ra’zac. I guess it’s decided, \\nthen; that’s where we’ll go.”\\nEragon sat \\nabruptly, too drained of emotion to even ask what Helgrind was.I thought I \\nwould be happy to resume the hunt. Instead, I feel like an abyss has opened up \\nbefore me. Dras-Leona! It’s so far away. . . .\\nThe parchment \\ncrackled as Jeod slowly rolled up the map. He handed it to Brom and said, \\n“You’ll need this, I’m afraid. Your expeditions often take you into obscure \\nregions.” Nodding, Brom accepted the map. Jeod clapped him on the shoulder. “It \\ndoesn’t feel right that you will leave without me. My heart expects to go \\nalong, but the rest of me reminds me of my age and responsibilities.”\\n“I know,” said \\nBrom. “But you have a life in Teirm. It is time for the next generation to take \\nup the standard. You’ve done your part; be happy.”\\n“What of you?” \\nasked Jeod. “Does the road ever end for you?”\\nA hollow laugh \\nescaped Brom’s lips. “I see it coming, but not for a while.” He extinguished \\nhis pipe, and they left for their rooms, exhausted. Before he fell asleep, \\nEragon contacted Saphira to relate the night’s adventures.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 30': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAC OSTLYMISTAKE\\nIn the morning \\nEragon and Brom retrieved their saddlebags from the stable and prepared to \\ndepart. Jeod greeted Brom while Helen watched from the doorway. With grave \\nlooks, the two men clasped hands. “I’ll miss you, old man,” said Jeod.\\n“And you I,” \\nsaid Brom thickly. He bowed his white head and then turned to Helen. “Thank you \\nfor your hospitality; it was most gracious.” Her face reddened. Eragon thought \\nshe was going to slap him. Brom continued, unperturbed, “You have a good \\nhusband; take care of him. There are few men as brave and as determined as he \\nis. But even he cannot weather difficult times without support from those he \\nloves.” He bowed again and said gently, “Only a suggestion, dear lady.”\\nEragon watched \\nas indignation and hurt crossed Helen’s face. Her eyes flashed as she shut the \\ndoor brusquely. Sighing, Jeod ran his fingers through his hair. Eragon thanked \\nhim for all his help, then mounted Cadoc. With the last farewells said, he and \\nBrom departed.\\nAt Teirm’s south \\ngate, the guards let them through without a second glance. As they rode under \\nthe giant outer wall, Eragon saw movement in a shadow. Solembum was crouched on \\nthe ground, tail twitching. The werecat followed them with inscrutable eyes. As \\nthe city receded into the distance, Eragon asked, “What are werecats?”\\nBrom looked \\nsurprised at the question. “Why the sudden curiosity?”\\n“I heard someone \\nmention them in Teirm. They’re not real, are they?” said Eragon, pretending \\nignorance.\\n“They are quite \\nreal. During the Riders’ years of glory, they were as renowned as the dragons. \\nKings and elves kept them as companions—yet the werecats were free to do what \\nthey chose. Very little has ever been known about them. I’m afraid that their \\nrace has become rather scarce recently.”\\n“Could they use \\nmagic?” asked Eragon.\\n“No one’s sure, \\nbut they could certainly do unusual things. They always seemed to know what was \\ngoing on and somehow or another manage to get themselves involved.” Brom pulled \\nhis hood up to block a chill wind.\\n“What’s \\nHelgrind?” asked Eragon, after a moment’s thought.\\n“You’ll see when \\nwe get to Dras-Leona.”\\nWhen Teirm was \\nout of sight, Eragon reached out with his mind and called,Saphira! The force \\nof his mental shout was so strong that Cadoc flicked his ears in annoyance.\\nSaphira answered \\nand sped toward them with all of her strength. Eragon and Brom watched as a \\ndark blur rushed from a cloud, then heard a dull roar as Saphira’s wings flared \\nopen. The sun shone behind the thin membranes, turning them translucent and \\nsilhouetting the dark veins. She landed with a blast of air.\\nEragon tossed \\nCadoc’s reins to Brom. “I’ll join you for lunch.”\\nBrom nodded, but \\nseemed preoccupied. “Have a good time,” he said, then looked at Saphira and \\nsmiled. “It’s good to see you again.”\\nAnd you too. \\nEragon hopped \\nonto Saphira’s shoulders and held on tightly as she bounded upward. With the \\nwind at her tail, Saphira sliced through the air.Hold on, she warned \\nEragon, and letting out a wild bugle, she soared in a great loop. Eragon yelled \\nwith excitement as he flung his arms in the air, holding on only with his legs.\\nI didn’t know I \\ncould stay on while you did that without being strapped into the saddle,he said, grinning \\nfiercely.\\nNeither did I,admitted \\nSaphira, laughing in her peculiar way. Eragon hugged her tightly, and they flew \\na level path, masters of the sky.\\nBy noon his legs \\nwere sore from riding bareback, and his hands and face were numb from the cold \\nair. Saphira’s scales were always warm to the touch, but she could not keep him \\nfrom getting chilled. When they landed for lunch, he buried his hands in his \\nclothes and found a warm, sunny place to sit. As he and Brom ate, Eragon asked \\nSaphira,Do you mind if I ride Cadoc? He had decided to question Brom \\nfurther about his past.\\nNo, but tell me \\nwhat he says.Eragon \\nwas not surprised that Saphira knew his plans. It was nearly impossible to hide \\nanything from her when they were mentally linked. When they finished eating, she \\nflew away as he joined Brom on the trail. After a time, Eragon slowed Cadoc and \\nsaid, “I need to talk to you. I wanted to do it when we first arrived in Teirm, \\nbut I decided to wait until now.”\\n“About what?” \\nasked Brom.\\nEragon paused. \\n“There’s a lot going on that I don’t understand. For instance, who are your \\n‘friends,’ and why were you hiding in Carvahall? I trust you with my life—which \\nis why I’m still traveling with you—but I need to know more about who you are \\nand what you are doing. What did you steal in Gil’ead, and what is the tuatha \\ndu orothrim that you’re taking me through? I think that after all that’s \\nhappened, I deserve an explanation.”\\n“You \\neavesdropped on us.”\\n“Only once,” \\nsaid Eragon.\\n“I see that you \\nhave yet to learn proper manners,” said Brom grimly, tugging on his beard. \\n“What makes you think that this concerns you?”\\n“Nothing, \\nreally,” said Eragon shrugging. “Just it’s an odd coincidence that you happened \\nto be hiding in Carvahall when I found Saphira’s eggand that you also \\nknow so much dragonlore. The more I think about it, the less likely it seems. \\nThere were other clues that I mostly ignored, but they’re obvious now that I \\nlook back. Like how you knew of the Ra’zac in the first place and why they ran \\naway when you approached. And I can’t help but wonder if you had something to \\ndo with the appearance of Saphira’s egg. There’s a lot you haven’t told us, and \\nSaphira and I can’t afford to ignore anything that might be dangerous.”\\nDark lines \\nappeared on Brom’s forehead as he reined Snowfire to a halt. “You won’t wait?” \\nhe asked. Eragon shook his head mulishly. Brom sighed. “This wouldn’t be a \\nproblem if you weren’t so suspicious, but I suppose that you wouldn’t be worth \\nmy time if you were otherwise.” Eragon was unsure if he should take that as a \\ncompliment. Brom lit his pipe and slowly blew a plume of smoke into the air. \\n“I’ll tell you,” he said, “but you have to understand that I cannot reveal \\neverything.” Eragon started to protest, but Brom cut him off. “It’s not out of \\na desire to withhold information, but because I won’t give away secrets that \\naren’t mine. There are other stories woven in with this narrative. You’ll have \\nto talk with the others involved to find out the rest.”\\n“Very well. Explain \\nwhat you can,” said Eragon.\\n“Are you sure?” \\nasked Brom. “There are reasons for my secretiveness. I’ve tried to protect you \\nby shielding you from forces that would tear you apart. Once you know of them \\nand their purposes, you’ll never have the chance to live quietly. You will have \\nto choose sides and make a stand. Do you really want to know?”\\n“I cannot live \\nmy life in ignorance,” said Eragon quietly.\\n“A worthy goal. \\n. . . Very well: there is a war raging in Alagaësia between the Varden and the \\nEmpire. Their conflict, however, reaches far beyond any incidental armed \\nclashes. They are locked in a titanic power struggle . . . centered around \\nyou.”\\n“Me?” said \\nEragon, disbelieving. “That’s impossible. I don’t have anything to do with \\neither of them.”\\n“Not yet,” said \\nBrom, “but your very existence is the focus of their battles. The Varden and \\nthe Empire aren’t fighting to control this land or its people. Their goal is to \\ncontrol the next generation of Riders, of whom you are the first. Whoever \\ncontrols these Riders will become the undisputed master of Alagaësia.”\\nEragon tried to \\nabsorb Brom’s statements. It seemed incomprehensible that so many people would \\nbe interested in him and Saphira. No one besides Brom had thought he was that \\nimportant. The whole concept of the Empire and Varden fighting over him was too \\nabstract for him to grasp fully. Objections quickly formed in his mind. “But \\nall the Riders were killed except for the Forsworn, who joined Galbatorix. As \\nfar as I know, even those are now dead. And you told me in Carvahall that no \\none knows if there are still dragons in Alagaësia.”\\n“I lied about \\nthe dragons,” said Brom flatly. “Even though the Riders are gone, there are \\nstill three dragon eggs left—all of them in Galbatorix’s possession. Actually \\nthere are only two now, since Saphira hatched. The king salvaged the three \\nduring his last great battle with the Riders.”\\n“So there may \\nsoon be two new Riders, both of them loyal to the king?” asked Eragon with a \\nsinking feeling.\\n“Exactly,” said \\nBrom. “There is a deadly race in progress. Galbatorix is desperately trying to \\nfind the people for whom his eggs will hatch, while the Varden are employing \\nevery means to kill his candidates or steal the eggs.”\\n“But where did \\nSaphira’s egg come from? How could anyone have gotten it away from the king? \\nAnd why do you know all of this?” asked Eragon, bewildered.\\n“So many \\nquestions,” laughed Brom bitterly. “There is another chapter to all this, one \\nthat took place long before you were born. Back then I was a bit younger, though \\nperhaps not as wise. I hated the Empire—for reasons I’ll keep to myself—and \\nwanted to damage it in any way I could. My fervor led me to a scholar, Jeod, \\nwho claimed to have discovered a book that showed a secret passageway into \\nGalbatorix’s castle. I eagerly brought Jeod to the Varden—who are my \\n‘friends’—and they arranged to have the eggs stolen.”\\nThe Varden! \\n“However, \\nsomething went amiss, and our thief got only one egg. For some reason he fled \\nwith it and didn’t return to the Varden. When he wasn’t found, Jeod and I were \\nsent to bring him and the egg back.” Brom’s eyes grew distant, and he spoke in \\na curious voice. “That was the start of one of the greatest searches in \\nhistory. We raced against the Ra’zac and Morzan, last of the Forsworn and the \\nking’s finest servant.”\\n“Morzan!” \\ninterrupted Eragon. “But he was the one who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix!”And \\nthat happened so long ago! Morzan must have been ancient. It disturbed him \\nto be reminded of how long Riders lived.\\n“So?” asked \\nBrom, raising an eyebrow. “Yes, he was old, but strong and cruel. He was one of \\nthe king’s first followers and by far his most loyal. As there had been blood \\nbetween us before, the hunt for the egg turned into a personal battle. When it \\nwas located in Gil’ead, I rushed there and fought Morzan for possession. It was \\na terrible contest, but in the end I slew him. During the conflict I was \\nseparated from Jeod. There was no time to search for him, so I took the egg and \\nbore it to the Varden, who asked me to train whomever became the new Rider. I \\nagreed and decided to hide in Carvahall—which I had been to several times \\nbefore—until the Varden contacted me. I was never summoned.”\\n“Then how did \\nSaphira’s egg appear in the Spine? Was another one stolen from the king?” asked \\nEragon.\\nBrom grunted. \\n“Small chance of that. He has the remaining two guarded so thoroughly that it \\nwould be suicide to try and steal them. No, Saphira was taken from the Varden, \\nand I think I know how. To protect the egg, its guardian must have tried to \\nsend it to me with magic.\\n“The Varden \\nhaven’t contacted me to explain how they lost the egg, so I suspect that their \\nrunners were intercepted by the Empire and the Ra’zac were sent in their place. \\nI’m sure they were quite eager to find me, as I’ve managed to foil many of \\ntheir plans.”\\n“Then the Ra’zac \\ndidn’t know about me when they arrived in Carvahall,” said Eragon with wonder.\\n“That’s right,” \\nreplied Brom. “If that ass Sloan had kept his mouth shut, they might not have \\nfound out about you. Events could have turned out quite differently. In a way I \\nhave you to thank for my life. If the Ra’zac hadn’t become so preoccupied with \\nyou, they might have caught me unawares, and that would have been the end of \\nBrom the storyteller. The only reason they ran was because I’m stronger than \\nthe two of them, especially during the day. They must have planned to drug me \\nduring the night, then question me about the egg.”\\n“You sent a \\nmessage to the Varden, telling them about me?”\\n“Yes. I’m sure \\nthey’ll want me to bring you to them as soon as possible.”\\n“But you’re not \\ngoing to, are you?”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, I’m not.”\\n“Why not? Being \\nwith the Varden must be safer than chasing after the Ra’zac, especially for a \\nnew Rider.”\\nBrom snorted and \\nlooked at Eragon with fondness. “The Varden are dangerous people. If we go to \\nthem, you will be entangled in their politics and machinations. Their leaders \\nmay send you on missions just to make a point, even though you might not be \\nstrong enough for them. I want you to be well prepared before you go anywhere \\nnear the Varden. At least while we pursue the Ra’zac, I don’t have to worry \\nabout someone poisoning your water. This is the lesser of two evils. And,” he \\nsaid with a smile, “it keeps you happy while I train you. . . . Tuatha du \\norothrim is just a stage in your instruction. Iwill help you find—and \\nperhaps even kill—the Ra’zac, for they are as much my enemies as yours. But \\nthen you will have to make a choice.”\\n“And that would \\nbe . . . ?” asked Eragon warily.\\n“Whether to join \\nthe Varden,” said Brom. “If you kill the Ra’zac, the only ways for you to \\nescape Galbatorix’s wrath will be to seek the Varden’s protection, flee to \\nSurda, or plead for the king’s mercy and join his forces. Even if you don’t \\nkill the Ra’zac, you will still face this choice eventually.”\\nEragon knew the \\nbest way to gain sanctuary might be to join the Varden, but he did not want to \\nspend his entire life fighting the Empire like they did. He mulled over Brom’s \\ncomments, trying to consider them from every angle. “You still didn’t explain \\nhow you know so much about dragons.”\\n“No, I didn’t, \\ndid I?” said Brom with a crooked smile. “That will have to wait for another \\ntime.”\\nWhy me?Eragon asked \\nhimself. What made him so special that he should become a Rider? “Did you ever \\nmeet my mother?” he blurted.\\nBrom looked \\ngrave. “Yes, I did.”\\n“What was she \\nlike?”\\nThe old man \\nsighed. “She was full of dignity and pride, like Garrow. Ultimately it was her \\ndownfall, but it was one of her greatest gifts nevertheless. . . . She always \\nhelped the poor and the less fortunate, no matter what her situation.”\\n“You knew her \\nwell?” asked Eragon, startled.\\n“Well enough to \\nmiss her when she was gone.”\\nAs Cadoc plodded \\nalong, Eragon tried to recall when he had thought that Brom was just a scruffy \\nold man who told stories. For the first time Eragon understood how ignorant he \\nhad been.\\nHe told Saphira \\nwhat he had learned. She was intrigued by Brom’s revelations, but recoiled from \\nthe thought of being one of Galbatorix’s possessions. At last she said,Aren’t \\nyou glad that you didn’t stay in Carvahall? Think of all the interesting \\nexperiences you would have missed! Eragon groaned in mock distress.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the day, Eragon searched for water while Brom made dinner. He \\nrubbed his hands together for warmth as he walked in a large circle, listening \\nfor a creek or spring. It was gloomy and damp between the trees.\\nHe found a \\nstream a ways from the camp, then crouched on the bank and watched the water \\nsplash over the rocks, dipping in his fingertips. The icy mountain water \\nswirled around his skin, numbing it.It doesn’t care what happens to us, or \\nanyone else, thought Eragon. He shivered and stood.\\nAn unusual print \\non the opposing stream bank caught his attention. It was oddly shaped and very \\nlarge. Curious, he jumped across the stream and onto a rock shelf. As he \\nlanded, his foot hit a patch of damp moss. He grabbed a branch for support, but \\nit broke, and he thrust out his hand to break his fall. He felt his right wrist \\ncrack as he hit the ground. Pain lanced up his arm.\\nA steady stream \\nof curses came out from behind his clenched teeth as he tried not to howl. Half \\nblind with pain, he curled on the ground, cradling his arm.Eragon! came \\nSaphira’s alarmed cry.What happened?\\nBroke my wrist . \\n. . did something stupid . . . fell. \\nI’m coming,said Saphira.\\nNo—I can make it \\nback. Don’t . . . come. Trees too close for . . . wings. \\nShe sent him a \\nbrief image of her tearing the forest apart to get at him, then said,Hurry.\\nGroaning, he \\nstaggered upright. The print was pressed deeply into the ground a few feet \\naway. It was the mark of a heavy, nail-studded boot. Eragon instantly \\nremembered the tracks that had surrounded the pile of bodies in Yazuac. \\n“Urgal,” he spat, wishing that Zar’roc was with him; he could not use his bow \\nwith only one hand. His head snapped up, and he shouted with his mind,Saphira! \\nUrgals! Keep Brom safe.\\nEragon leapt \\nback over the stream and raced toward their camp, yanking out his hunting \\nknife. He saw potential enemies behind every tree and bush.I hope there’s \\nonly one Urgal. He burst into the camp, ducking as Saphira’s tail swung \\noverhead. “Stop. It’s me!” he yelled.\\nOops,said Saphira. \\nHer wings were folded in front of her chest like a wall.\\n“Oops?” growled \\nEragon, running to her. “You could’ve killed me! Where’s Brom?”\\n“I’m right \\nhere,” snapped Brom’s voice from behind Saphira’s wings. “Tell your crazy \\ndragon to release me; she won’t listen to me.”\\n“Let him go!” \\nsaid Eragon, exasperated. “Didn’t you tell him?”\\nNo,she said \\nsheepishly.You just said to keep him safe. She lifted her wings, and \\nBrom stepped forward angrily.\\n“I found an \\nUrgal footprint. And it’s fresh.”\\nBrom immediately \\nturned serious. “Saddle the horses. We’re leaving.” He put out the fire, but \\nEragon did not move. “What’s wrong with your arm?”\\n“My wrist is \\nbroken,” he said, swaying.\\nBrom cursed and \\nsaddled Cadoc for him. He helped Eragon onto the horse and said, “We have to \\nput a splint on your arm as soon as possible. Try not to move your wrist until \\nthen.” Eragon gripped the reins tightly with his left hand. Brom said to \\nSaphira, “It’s almost dark; you might as well fly right overhead. If Urgals \\nshow up, they’ll think twice about attacking with you nearby.”\\nThey’d better, \\nor else they won’t think again,remarked Saphira as she took off.\\nThe light was \\ndisappearing quickly, and the horses were tired, but they spurred them on \\nwithout respite. Eragon’s wrist, swollen and red, continued to throb. A mile \\nfrom the camp, Brom halted. “Listen,” he said.\\nEragon heard the \\nfaint call of a hunting horn behind them. As it fell silent, panic gripped him. \\n“They must have found where we were,” said Brom, “and probably Saphira’s \\ntracks. They will chase us now. It’s not in their nature to let prey escape.” \\nThen two horns winded. They were closer. A chill ran through Eragon. “Our only \\nchance is to run,” said Brom. He raised his head to the sky, and his face \\nblanked as he called Saphira.\\nShe rushed out \\nof the night sky and landed. “Leave Cadoc. Go with her. You’ll be safer,” \\ncommanded Brom.\\n“What about \\nyou?” Eragon protested.\\n“I’ll be fine. \\nNow go!” Unable to muster the energy to argue, Eragon climbed onto Saphira \\nwhile Brom lashed Snowfire and rode away with Cadoc. Saphira flew after him, \\nflapping above the galloping horses.\\nEragon clung to \\nSaphira as best he could; he winced whenever her movements jostled his wrist. \\nThe horns blared nearby, bringing a fresh wave of terror. Brom crashed through \\nthe underbrush, forcing the horses to their limits. The horns trumpeted in \\nunison close behind him, then were quiet.\\nMinutes passed.Where \\nare the Urgals? wondered Eragon. A horn sounded, this time in the distance. \\nHe sighed in relief, resting against Saphira’s neck, while on the ground Brom \\nslowed his headlong rush.That was close, said Eragon.\\nYes, but we \\ncannot stop until—Saphira \\nwas interrupted as a horn blasted directly underneath them. Eragon jerked in \\nsurprise, and Brom resumed his frenzied retreat. Horned Urgals, shouting with \\ncoarse voices, barreled along the trail on horses, swiftly gaining ground. They \\nwere almost in sight of Brom; the old man could not outrun them.We have to \\ndo something! exclaimed Eragon.\\nWhat? \\nLand in front of \\nthe Urgals!\\n\\nAre you crazy?demanded \\nSaphira.\\nLand! I know \\nwhat I’m doing,said \\nEragon.There isn’t time for anything else. They’re going to overtake Brom!\\nVery well.Saphira pulled \\nahead of the Urgals, then turned, preparing to drop onto the trail. Eragon \\nreached for his power and felt the familiar resistance in his mind that separated \\nhim from the magic. He did not try to breach it yet. A muscle twitched in his \\nneck.\\nAs the Urgals \\npounded up the trail, he shouted, “Now!” Saphira abruptly folded her wings and \\ndropped straight down from above the trees, landing on the trail in a spray of \\ndirt and rocks.\\nThe Urgals \\nshouted with alarm and yanked on their horses’ reins. The animals went \\nstiff-legged and collided into each other, but the Urgals quickly untangled \\nthemselves to face Saphira with bared weapons. Hate crossed their faces as they \\nglared at her. There were twelve of them, all ugly, jeering brutes. Eragon \\nwondered why they did not flee. He had thought that the sight of Saphira would \\nfrighten them away.Why are they waiting? Are they going to attack us or not?\\nHe was shocked \\nwhen the largest Urgal advanced and spat, “Our master wishes to speak with you, \\nhuman!” The monster spoke in deep, rolling gutturals.\\nIt’s a trap,warned Saphira \\nbefore Eragon could say anything.Don’t listen to him.\\nAt least let’s \\nfind out what he has to say,he reasoned, curious, but extremely \\nwary. “Who is your master?” he asked.\\nThe Urgal \\nsneered. “His name does not deserve to be given to one as low as yourself. He \\nrules the sky and holds dominance over the earth. You are no more than a stray \\nant to him. Yet he has decreed that you shall be brought before him,alive \\n. Take heart that you have become worthy of such notice!”\\n“I’ll never go \\nwith you nor any of my enemies!” declared Eragon, thinking of Yazuac. “Whether \\nyou serve Shade, Urgal, or some twisted fiend I’ve not heard of, I have no wish \\nto parley with him.”\\n“That is a grave \\nmistake,” growled the Urgal, showing his fangs. “There is no way to escape him. \\nEventually you will stand before our master. If you resist, he will fill your \\ndays with agony.”\\nEragon wondered \\nwho had the power to bring the Urgals under one banner. Was there a third great \\nforce loose in the land—along with the Empire and the Varden? “Keep your offer \\nand tell your master that the crows can eat his entrails for all I care!”\\nRage swept \\nthrough the Urgals; their leader howled, gnashing his teeth. “We’ll drag you to \\nhim, then!” He waved his arm and the Urgals rushed at Saphira. Raising his \\nright hand, Eragon barked, “Jierda!”\\nNo!cried Saphira, \\nbut it was too late.\\nThe monsters \\nfaltered as Eragon’s palm glowed. Beams of light lanced from his hand, striking \\neach of them in the gut. The Urgals were thrown through the air and smashed \\ninto trees, falling senseless to the ground.\\nFatigue suddenly \\ndrained Eragon of strength, and he tumbled off Saphira. His mind felt hazy and \\ndull. As Saphira bent over him, he realized that he might have gone too far. \\nThe energy needed to lift and throw twelve Urgals was enormous. Fear engulfed \\nhim as he struggled to stay conscious.\\nAt the edge of \\nhis vision he saw one of the Urgals stagger to his feet, sword in hand. Eragon \\ntried to warn Saphira, but he was too weak.No . . . , he thought feebly. \\nThe Urgal crept toward Saphira until he was well past her tail, then raised his \\nsword to strike her neck.No! . . . Saphira whirled on the monster, \\nroaring savagely. Her talons slashed with blinding speed. Blood spurted \\neverywhere as the Urgal was rent in two.\\nSaphira snapped \\nher jaws together with finality and returned to Eragon. She gently wrapped her \\nbloody claws around his torso, then growled and jumped into the air. The night \\nblurred into a pain-filled streak. The hypnotic sound of Saphira’s wings put \\nhim in a bleary trance: up, down; up, down; up, down. . . .\\nWhen Saphira \\neventually landed, Eragon was dimly aware of Brom talking with her. Eragon \\ncould not understand what they said, but a decision must have been reached \\nbecause Saphira took off again.\\nHis stupor \\nyielded to sleep that covered him like a soft blanket.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 31': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nV ISION OFPERFECTION\\nEragon twisted under \\nthe blankets, reluctant to open his eyes. He dozed, then a fuzzy thought \\nentered his mind . . .How did I get here? Confused, he pulled the \\nblankets tighter and felt something hard on his right arm. He tried to move his \\nwrist. It zinged with pain.The Urgals! He bolted upright.\\nHe lay in a \\nsmall clearing that was empty save a small campfire heating a stew-filled pot. \\nA squirrel chattered on a branch. His bow and quiver rested alongside the \\nblankets. Attempting to stand made him grimace, as his muscles were feeble and \\nsore. There was a heavy splint on his bruised right arm.\\nWhere is \\neveryone?he \\nwondered forlornly. He tried to call Saphira, but to his alarm could not feel \\nher. Ravenous hunger gripped him, so he ate the stew. Still hungry, he looked \\nfor the saddlebags, hoping to find a chunk of bread. Neither the saddlebags nor \\nthe horses were in the clearing.I’m sure there’s a good reason for this, \\nhe thought, suppressing a surge of uneasiness.\\nHe wandered \\nabout the clearing, then returned to his blankets and rolled them up. Without \\nanything better to do, he sat against a tree and watched the clouds overhead. \\nHours passed, but Brom and Saphira did not show up.I hope nothing’s wrong.\\nAs the afternoon \\ndragged on, Eragon grew bored and started to explore the surrounding forest. \\nWhen he became tired, he rested under a fir tree that leaned against a boulder \\nwith a bowl-shaped depression filled with clear dew water.\\nEragon stared at \\nthe water and thought about Brom’s instructions for scrying.Maybe I can see \\nwhere Saphira is. Brom said that scrying takes a lot of energy, but I’m \\nstronger than he is. . . . He breathed deeply and closed his eyes. In his \\nmind he formed a picture of Saphira, making it as lifelike as possible. It was \\nmore demanding than he expected. Then he said, “Draumr kópa!”and gazed at the \\nwater.\\nIts surface \\nbecame completely flat, frozen by an invisible force. The reflections \\ndisappeared and the water became clear. On it shimmered an image of Saphira. \\nHer surroundings were pure white, but Eragon could see that she was flying. \\nBrom sat on her back, beard streaming, sword on his knees.\\nEragon tiredly \\nlet the image fade.At least they’re safe. He gave himself a few minutes \\nto recuperate, then leaned back over the water.Roran, how are you? In \\nhis mind he saw his cousin clearly. Impulsively, he drew upon the magic and \\nuttered the words.\\nThe water grew \\nstill, then the image formed on its surface. Roran appeared, sitting on an \\ninvisible chair. Like Saphira, his surroundings were white. There were new \\nlines on Roran’s face—he looked more like Garrow than ever before. Eragon held \\nthe image in place as long as he could.Is Roran in Therinsford? He’s \\ncertainly nowhere I’ve been.\\nThe strain of \\nusing magic had brought beads of sweat to his forehead. He sighed and for a long \\ntime was content just to sit. Then an absurd notion struck him.What if I \\ntried to scry something I created with my imagination or saw in a dream? He \\nsmiled.Perhaps I’d be shown what my own consciousness looks like.\\nIt was too \\ntempting an idea to pass by. He knelt by the water once again.What shall I \\nlook for? He considered a few things, but discarded them all when he \\nremembered his dream about the woman in the cell.\\nAfter fixing the \\nscene in his mind, he spoke the words and watched the water intently. He \\nwaited, but nothing happened. Disappointed, he was about to release the magic \\nwhen inky blackness swirled across the water, covering the surface. The image \\nof a lone candle flickered in the darkness, brightening to illuminate a stone \\ncell. The woman from his dream was curled up on a cot in one corner. She lifted \\nher head, dark hair falling back, and stared directly at Eragon. He froze, the \\nforce of her gaze keeping him in place. Chills ran up his spine as their eyes \\nlocked. Then the woman trembled and collapsed limply.\\nThe water \\ncleared. Eragon rocked back on his heels, gasping. “This can’t be.”She \\nshouldn’t be real; I only dreamed about her! How could she know I was looking \\nat her? And how could I have scryed into a dungeon that I’ve never seen? He \\nshook his head, wondering if any of his other dreams had been visions.\\nThe rhythmic \\nthump of Saphira’s wings interrupted his thoughts. He hurried back to the \\nclearing, arriving just as Saphira landed. Brom was on her back, as Eragon had \\nseen, but his sword was now bloody. Brom’s face was contorted; the edges of his \\nbeard were stained red. “What happened?” asked Eragon, afraid that he had been \\nwounded.\\n“What happened?” \\nroared the old man. “I’ve been trying to clean up your mess!” He slashed the \\nair with the sword, flinging drops of blood along its arc. “Do you know what \\nyou did with that little trick of yours? Do you?”\\n“I stopped the \\nUrgals from catching you,” said Eragon, a pit forming in his stomach.\\n“Yes,” growled \\nBrom, “but that piece of magic nearly killed you! You’ve been sleeping for two \\ndays. There were twelve Urgals.Twelve! But that didn’t stop you from \\ntrying to throw them all the way to Teirm, now did it? What were you thinking? \\nSending a rock through each of their heads would have been the smart thing to \\ndo. But no, you had to knock them unconscious so they could run away later. \\nI’ve spent the last two days trying to track them down. Even with Saphira, \\nthree escaped!”\\n“I didn’t want \\nto kill them,” said Eragon, feeling very small.\\n“It wasn’t a \\nproblem in Yazuac.”\\n“There was no \\nchoice then, and I couldn’t control the magic. This time it just seemed . . . \\nextreme.”\\n“Extreme!” cried \\nBrom. “It’s not extreme when they wouldn’t show you the same mercy. And why, oh \\nwhy, did youshow yourself to them?”\\n“You said that \\nthey had found Saphira’s footprints. It didn’t make any difference if they saw \\nme,” said Eragon defensively.\\nBrom stabbed his \\nsword into the dirt and snapped, “I said they hadprobably found her \\ntracks. We didn’t know for certain. They might have believed they were chasing \\nsome stray travelers. But why would they think that now? After all,you \\nlanded right in front of them! And since you let them live, they’re \\nscrambling around the countryside with all sorts of fantastic tales! This might \\neven get back to the Empire!” He threw his hands up. “You don’t even deserve to \\nbe called a Rider after this,boy. ” Brom yanked his sword out of the \\nground and stomped to the fire. He took a rag from inside his robe and angrily \\nbegan to clean the blade.\\nEragon was \\nstunned. He tried to ask Saphira for advice, but all she would say was,Speak \\nwith Brom.\\nHesitantly, \\nEragon made his way to the fire and asked, “Would it help if I said I was \\nsorry?”\\nBrom sighed and \\nsheathed his sword. “No, it wouldn’t. Your feelings can’t change what \\nhappened.” He jabbed his finger at Eragon’s chest. “You made some very bad \\nchoices that could have dangerous repercussions. Not the least of which is that \\nyou almost died. Died, Eragon! From now on you’re going to have to think. \\nThere’s a reason why we’re born with brains in our heads, not rocks.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nabashed. “It’s not as bad as you think, though; the Urgals already knew about \\nme. They had orders to capture me.”\\nAstonishment \\nwidened Brom’s eyes. He stuck his unlit pipe in his mouth. “No, it’s not as bad \\nas I thought. It’s worse! Saphira told me you had talked with the Urgals, but \\nshe didn’t mention this.” The words tumbled out of Eragon’s mouth as he quickly \\ndescribed the confrontation. “So they have some sort of leader now, eh?” \\nquestioned Brom.\\nEragon nodded.\\n“And you just \\ndefied his wishes, insulted him, and attacked his men?” Brom shook his head. “I \\ndidn’t think it could get any worse. If the Urgals had been killed, your rudeness \\nwould have gone unnoticed, but now it’ll be impossible to ignore. \\nCongratulations, you just made enemies with one of the most powerful beings in \\nAlagaësia.”\\n“All right, I \\nmade a mistake,” said Eragon sullenly.\\n“Yes, you did,” \\nagreed Brom, eyes flashing. “What has me worried, though, is who this Urgal \\nleader is.”\\nShivering, \\nEragon asked softly, “What happens now?”\\nThere was an \\nuncomfortable pause. “Your arm is going to take at least a couple of weeks to \\nheal. That time would be well spent forging some sense into you. I suppose this \\nis partially my fault. I’ve been teaching youhow to do things, but not \\nwhether youshould. It takes discretion, something you obviously lack. \\nAll the magic in Alagaësia won’t help you if you don’t know when to use it.”\\n“But we’re still \\ngoing to Dras-Leona, right?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom rolled his \\neyes. “Yes, we can keep looking for the Ra’zac, but even if we find them, it \\nwon’t do any good until you’ve healed.” He began unsaddling Saphira. “Are you \\nwell enough to ride?”\\n“I think so.”\\n“Good, then we \\ncan still cover a few miles today.”\\n“Where are Cadoc \\nand Snowfire?”\\nBrom pointed off \\nto the side. “Over there a ways. I picketed them where there was grass.” Eragon \\nprepared to leave, then followed Brom to the horses.\\nSaphira said pointedly,If \\nyou had explained what you were planning to do, none of this would have \\nhappened. I would have told you it was a bad idea not to kill the Urgals. I \\nonly agreed to do what you asked because I assumed it was halfway reasonable!\\nI don’t want to \\ntalk about it.\\n\\nAs you wish,she sniffed.\\nAs they rode, \\nevery bump and dip in the trail made Eragon grit his teeth with discomfort. If \\nhe had been alone, he would have stopped. With Brom there, he dared not \\ncomplain. Also, Brom started drilling him with difficult scenarios involving \\nUrgals, magic, and Saphira. The imagined fights were many and varied. Sometimes \\na Shade or other dragons were included. Eragon discovered that it was possible \\nto torture his body and mind at the same time. He got most of the questions \\nwrong and became increasingly frustrated.\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the night, Brom grumbled shortly, “It was a start.” Eragon knew \\nthat he was disappointed.\\nM ASTER \\nOF THEBLADE\\nThe next day was \\neasier on both of them. Eragon felt better and was able to answer more of \\nBrom’s questions correctly. After an especially difficult exercise, Eragon \\nmentioned his scrying of the woman. Brom pulled on his beard. “You say she was \\nimprisoned?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Did you see her \\nface?” asked Brom intently.\\n“Not very \\nclearly. The lighting was bad, yet I could tell that she was beautiful. It’s \\nstrange; I didn’t have any problem seeing her eyes. And she did look at me.”\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “As far as I know, it’s impossible for anyone to know if they’re being \\nscryed upon.”\\n“Do you know who \\nshe might be?” asked Eragon, surprised by the eagerness in his own voice.\\n“Not really,” \\nadmitted Brom. “If pressed, I suppose I could come up with a few guesses, but \\nnone of them would be very likely. This dream of yours is peculiar. Somehow you \\nmanaged to scry in your sleep something that you’d never seen before—without \\nsaying the words of power. Dreams do occasionally touch the spirit realm, but \\nthis is different.”\\n“Perhaps to \\nunderstand this we should search every prison and dungeon until we find the \\nwoman,” bantered Eragon. He actually thought it would be a good idea. Brom \\nlaughed and rode on.\\n\\xa0\\nBrom’s strict \\ntraining filled nearly every hour as the days slowly blended into weeks. \\nBecause of his splint, Eragon was forced to use his left hand whenever they \\nsparred. Before long he could duel as well with his left hand as he had with \\nhis right.\\nBy the time they \\ncrossed the Spine and came to the plains, spring had crept over Alagaësia, \\nsummoning a multitude of flowers. The bare deciduous trees were russet with \\nbuds, while new blades of grass began to push up between last year’s dead \\nstalks. Birds returned from their winter absence to mate and build nests.\\nThe travelers \\nfollowed the Toark River southeast, along the edge of the Spine. It grew steadily \\nas tributaries flowed into it from every side, feeding its bulging girth. When \\nthe river was over a league wide, Brom pointed at the silt islands that dotted \\nthe water. “We’re close to Leona Lake now,” he said. “It’s only about two \\nleagues away.”\\n“Do you think we \\ncan get there before nightfall?” asked Eragon.\\n“We can try.”\\nDusk soon made \\nthe trail hard to follow, but the sound of the river at their side guided them. \\nWhen the moon rose, the bright disk provided enough light to see what lay \\nahead.\\nLeona Lake \\nlooked like a thin sheet of silver beaten over the land. The water was so calm \\nand smooth it did not even seem to be liquid. Aside from a bright strip of \\nmoonlight reflecting off the surface, it was indistinguishable from the ground. \\nSaphira was on the rocky shore, fanning her wings to dry them. Eragon greeted \\nher and she said,The water is lovely—deep, cool, and clear.\\nMaybe I’ll go \\nswimming tomorrow,he \\nresponded. They set up camp under a stand of trees and were soon asleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAt dawn, Eragon \\neagerly rushed out to see the lake in daylight. A whitecapped expanse of water \\nrippled with fan-shaped patterns where wind brushed it. The pure size of it \\ndelighted him. He whooped and ran to the water.Saphira, where are you? Let’s \\nhave some fun!\\nThe moment Eragon \\nclimbed onto her, she jumped out over the water. They soared upward, circling \\nover the lake, but even at that height the opposing shore was not visible.Would \\nyou like to take a bath? Eragon casually asked Saphira.\\nShe grinned \\nwolfishly.Hold on! She locked her wings and sank to the waves, clipping \\nthe crests with her claws. The water sparkled in the sunlight as they sailed \\nover it. Eragon whooped again. Then Saphira folded her wings and dived into the \\nlake, her head and neck entering it like a lance.\\nThe water hit \\nEragon like an icy wall, knocking out his breath and almost tearing him off \\nSaphira. He held on tightly as she swam to the surface. With three strokes of \\nher feet, she breached it and sent a burst of shimmering water toward the sky. \\nEragon gasped and shook his hair as Saphira slithered across the lake, using \\nher tail as a rudder.\\nReady? \\nEragon nodded \\nand took a deep breath, tightening his arms. This time they slid gently under \\nthe water. They could see for yards through the unclouded liquid. Saphira \\ntwisted and turned in fantastic shapes, slipping through the water like an eel. \\nEragon felt as if he were riding a sea serpent of legend.\\nJust as his \\nlungs started to cry for air, Saphira arched her back and pointed her head \\nupward. An explosion of droplets haloed them as she leapt into the air, wings \\nsnapping open. With two powerful flaps she gained altitude.\\nWow! That was \\nfantastic,exclaimed \\nEragon.\\nYes,said Saphira \\nhappily.Though it’s a pity you can’t hold your breath longer.\\nNothing I can do \\nabout that,he \\nsaid, pressing water out of his hair. His clothes were drenched, and the wind \\nfrom Saphira’s wings chilled him. He pulled at his splint—his wrist itched.\\nOnce Eragon was \\ndry, he and Brom saddled the horses and started around Leona Lake in high \\nspirits while Saphira playfully dived in and out of the water.\\n\\xa0\\nBefore dinner, \\nEragon blocked Zar’roc’s edge in preparation for their usual sparring. Neither \\nhe nor Brom moved as they waited for the other to strike first. Eragon \\ninspected their surroundings for anything that might give him an advantage. A \\nstick near the fire caught his attention.\\nEragon swooped \\ndown, grabbed the stick, and hurled it at Brom. The splint got in his way, \\nthough, and Brom easily sidestepped the piece of wood. The old man rushed forward, \\nswinging his sword. Eragon ducked just as the blade whistled over his head. He \\ngrowled and tackled Brom ferociously.\\nThey pitched to \\nthe ground, each struggling to stay on top. Eragon rolled to the side and swept \\nZar’roc over the ground at Brom’s shins. Brom parried the blow with the hilt of \\nhis sword, then jumped to his feet. Twisting as he stood, Eragon attacked \\nagain, guiding Zar’roc through a complex pattern. Sparks danced from their \\nblades as they struck again and again. Brom blocked each blow, his face tight \\nwith concentration. But Eragon could tell that he was tiring. The relentless \\nhammering continued as each sought an opening in the other’s defenses.\\nThen Eragon felt \\nthe battle change. Blow by blow he gained advantage; Brom’s parries slowed and \\nhe lost ground. Eragon easily blocked a stab from Brom. Veins pulsed on the old \\nman’s forehead and cords bulged in his neck from the effort.\\nSuddenly \\nconfident, Eragon swung Zar’roc faster than ever, weaving a web of steel around \\nBrom’s sword. With a burst of speed, he smashed the flat of his blade against \\nBrom’s guard and knocked the sword to the ground. Before Brom could react, \\nEragon flicked Zar’roc up to his throat.\\nThey stood \\npanting, the red sword tip resting on Brom’s collarbone. Eragon slowly lowered \\nhis arm and backed away. It was the first time he had bested Brom without \\nresorting to trickery. Brom picked up his sword and sheathed it. Still \\nbreathing hard, he said, “We’re done for today.”\\n“But we just \\nstarted,” said Eragon, startled.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “I can teach you nothing more of the sword. Of all the fighters I’ve met, \\nonly three of them could have defeated me like that, and I doubt any of them \\ncould have done it with their left hand.” He smiled ruefully. “I may not be as \\nyoung as I used to be, but I can tell that you’re a talented and rare \\nswordsman.”\\n“Does this mean \\nwe’re not going to spar every night?” asked Eragon.\\n“Oh, you’re not \\ngetting out of it,” laughed Brom. “But we’ll go easier now. It’s not as \\nimportant if we miss a night here or there.” He wiped his brow. “Just remember, \\nif you ever have the misfortune to fight an elf—trained or not, female or \\nmale—expect to lose. They, along with dragons and other creatures of magic, are \\nmany times stronger than nature intended. Even the weakest elf could easily \\noverpower you. The same goes for the Ra’zac—they are not human and tire much \\nmore slowly than we do.”\\n“Is there any \\nway to become their equal?” asked Eragon. He sat cross-legged by Saphira.\\nYou fought well,she said. He \\nsmiled.\\nBrom seated \\nhimself with a shrug. “There are a few, but none are available to you now. \\nMagic will let you defeat all but the strongest enemies. For those you’ll need \\nSaphira’s help, plus a great deal of luck. Remember, when creatures of magic \\nactually use magic, they can accomplish things that could kill a human, because \\nof their enhanced abilities.”\\n“How do you \\nfight with magic?” asked Eragon.\\n“What do you \\nmean?”\\n“Well,” he said, \\nleaning on an elbow. “Suppose I was attacked by a Shade. How could I block his \\nmagic? Most spells take place instantaneously, which makes it impossible to \\nreact in time. And even if I could, how would I nullify an enemy’s magic? It \\nseems I would have to know my opponent’s intentionbefore he acted.” He \\npaused. “I just don’t see how it can be done. Whoever attacked first would \\nwin.”\\nBrom sighed. \\n“What you are talking about—a ‘wizards’ duel,’ if you will—is extremely \\ndangerous. Haven’t you ever wondered how Galbatorix was able to defeat all of \\nthe Riders with the help of only a dozen or so traitors?”\\n“I never thought \\nabout it,” acknowledged Eragon.\\n“There are \\nseveral ways. Some you’ll learn about later, but the main one is that \\nGalbatorix was, and still is, a master of breaking into people’s minds. You \\nsee, in a wizards’ duel there are strict rules that each side must observe or \\nelse both contestants will die. To begin with, no one uses magic until one of \\nthe participants gains access to the other’s mind.”\\nSaphira curled \\nher tail comfortably around Eragon and asked,Why wait? By the time an enemy \\nrealizes that you’ve attacked, it will be too late for him to act. Eragon \\nrepeated the question out loud.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “No, it won’t. If I were to suddenly use my power against you, Eragon, \\nyou would surely die, but in the brief moment before you were destroyed, there \\nwould be time for a counterattack. Therefore, unless one combatant has a death \\nwish, neither side attacks until one of them has breached the other’s \\ndefenses.”\\n“Then what \\nhappens?” Eragon inquired.\\nBrom shrugged and \\nsaid, “Once you’re inside your enemy’s mind, it’s easy enough to anticipate \\nwhat he will do and prevent it. Even with that advantage, it’s still possible \\nto lose if you don’t know how to counteract spells.”\\nHe filled and \\nlit his pipe. “And that requires extraordinarily quick thinking. Before you can \\ndefend yourself, you have to understand the exact nature of the forces directed \\nat you. If you’re being attacked with heat, you have to know whether it is \\nbeing conveyed to you through air, fire, light, or some other medium. Only once \\nthat’s known can you combat the magic by, for instance, chilling the heated \\nmaterial.”\\n“It sounds \\ndifficult.”\\n“Extremely,” \\nconfirmed Brom. A plume of smoke rose from his pipe. “Seldom can people survive \\nsuch a duel for more than a few seconds. The enormous amount of effort and \\nskill required condemns anyone without the proper training to a quick death. \\nOnce you’ve progressed, I’ll start teaching you the necessary methods. In the \\nmeantime, if you ever find yourself facing a wizards’ duel, I suggest you run \\naway as fast as you can.”\\nT HEMIRE OF \\nDRAS-LEONA\\nThey lunched at \\nFasaloft, a bustling lakeside village. It was a charming place set on a rise \\noverlooking the lake. As they ate in the hostel’s common room, Eragon listened \\nintently to the gossip and was relieved to hear no rumors of him and Saphira.\\nThe trail, now a \\nroad, had grown steadily worse over the past two days. Wagon wheels and \\niron-shod hooves had conspired to tear up the ground, making many sections \\nimpassable. An increase in travelers forced Saphira to hide during the day and \\nthen catch up with Brom and Eragon at night.\\nFor days they \\ncontinued south along Leona Lake’s vast shore. Eragon began to wonder if they \\nwould ever get around it, so he was heartened when they met men who said that \\nDras-Leona was an easy day’s ride ahead of them.\\n\\xa0\\nEragon rose \\nearly the following morning. His fingers twitched with anticipation at the \\nthought of finally finding the Ra’zac.The two of you must be careful, \\nsaid Saphira.The Ra’zac could have spies watching for travelers that fit \\nyour description.\\nWe’ll do our \\nbest to remain inconspicuous,he assured her.\\nShe lowered her \\nhead until their eyes met.Perhaps, but realize that I won’t be able to \\nprotect you as I did with the Urgals. I will be too far away to come to your \\naid, nor would I survive long in the narrow streets your kind favor. Follow \\nBrom’s lead in this hunt; he is sensible.\\nI know,he said \\nsomberly.\\nWill you go with \\nBrom to the Varden? Once the Ra’zac are killed, he will want to take you to \\nthem. And since Galbatorix will be enraged by the Ra’zac’s death, that may be \\nthe safest thing for us to do. \\nEragon rubbed \\nhis arms.I don’t want to fight the Empire all the time like the Varden do. \\nLife is more than constant war. There’ll be time to consider it once the Ra’zac \\nare gone.\\nDon’t be too \\nsure,she \\nwarned, then went to hide herself until night.\\nThe road was \\nclogged with farmers taking their goods to market in Dras-Leona. Brom and \\nEragon were forced to slow their horses and wait for wagons that blocked the \\nway.\\nAlthough they \\nsaw smoke in the distance before noon, it was another league before the city \\nwas clearly visible. Unlike Teirm, a planned city, Dras-Leona was a tangled \\nmess that sprawled next to Leona Lake. Ramshackle buildings sat on crooked \\nstreets, and the heart of the city was surrounded by a dirty, pale yellow wall \\nof daubed mud.\\nSeveral miles \\neast, a mountain of bare rock speared the sky with spires and columns, a \\ntenebrous nightmare ship. Near-vertical sides rose out of the ground like a \\njagged piece of the earth’s bone.\\nBrom pointed. “Thatis \\nHelgrind. It’s the reason Dras-Leona was originally built. People are \\nfascinated by it, even though it’s an unhealthy and malevolent thing.” He \\ngestured at the buildings inside the city’s wall. “We should go to the center \\nof the city first.”\\nAs they crept \\nalong the road to Dras-Leona, Eragon saw that the highest building within the \\ncity was a cathedral that loomed behind the walls. It was strikingly similar to \\nHelgrind, especially when its arches and flanged spires caught the light. “Who \\ndo they worship?” he asked.\\nBrom grimaced in \\ndistaste. “Their prayers go to Helgrind. It’s a cruel religion they practice. \\nThey drink human blood and make flesh offerings. Their priests often lack body \\nparts because they believe that the more bone and sinew you give up, the less \\nyou’re attached to the mortal world. They spend much of their time arguing \\nabout which of Helgrind’s three peaks is the highest and most important and \\nwhether the fourth—and lowest—should be included in their worship.”\\n“That’s \\nhorrible,” said Eragon, shuddering.\\n“Yes,” said Brom \\ngrimly, “but don’t say that to a believer. You’ll quickly lose a hand in \\n‘penance.’ ”\\nAt Dras-Leona’s \\nenormous gates, they led the horses through the crush of people. Ten soldiers \\nwere stationed on either side of the gates, casually scanning the crowd. Eragon \\nand Brom passed into the city without incident.\\nThe houses \\ninside the city wall were tall and thin to compensate for the lack of space. Those \\nnext to the wall were braced against it. Most of the houses hung over the \\nnarrow, winding streets, covering the sky so that it was hard to tell if it was \\nnight or day. Nearly all the buildings were constructed of the same rough brown \\nwood, which darkened the city even more. The air reeked like a sewer; the \\nstreets were filthy.\\nA group of \\nragged children ran between the houses, fighting over scraps of bread. Deformed \\nbeggars crouched next to the entrance gates, pleading for money. Their cries \\nfor help were like a chorus of the damned.We don’t even treat animals like \\nthis, thought Eragon, eyes wide with anger. “I won’t stay here,” he said, \\nrebelling against the sight.\\n“It gets better \\nfarther in,” said Brom. “Right now we need to find an inn and form a strategy. \\nDras-Leona can be a dangerous place to even the most cautious. I don’t want to \\nremain on the streets any longer than necessary.”\\nThey forged \\ndeeper into Dras-Leona, leaving the squalid entrance behind. As they entered \\nwealthier parts of the city, Eragon wondered,How can these people live in \\nease when the suffering around them is so obvious?\\nThey found \\nlodging at the Golden Globe, which was cheap but not decrepit. A narrow bed was \\ncrammed against one wall of the room, with a rickety table and a basin alongside \\nit. Eragon took one look at the mattress and said, “I’m sleeping on the floor. \\nThere are probably enough bugs in that thing to eat me alive.”\\n“Well, I \\nwouldn’t want to deprive them of a meal,” said Brom, dropping his bags on the \\nmattress. Eragon set his own on the floor and pulled off his bow.\\n“What now?” he \\nasked.\\n“We find food \\nand beer. After that, sleep. Tomorrow we can start looking for the Ra’zac.” \\nBefore they left the room, Brom warned, “No matter what happens, make sure that \\nyour tongue doesn’t loosen. We’ll have to leave immediately if we’re given \\naway.”\\nThe inn’s food \\nwas barely adequate, but its beer was excellent. By the time they stumbled back \\nto the room, Eragon’s head was buzzing pleasantly. He unrolled his blankets on \\nthe floor and slid under them as Brom tumbled onto the bed.\\nJust before \\nEragon fell asleep, he contacted Saphira:We’re going to be here for a few \\ndays, but this shouldn’t take as long as it did at Teirm. When we discover \\nwhere the Ra’zac are, you might be able to help us get them. I’ll talk to you \\nin the morning. Right now I’m not thinking too clearly.\\nYou’ve been \\ndrinking,came \\nthe accusing thought. Eragon considered it for a moment and had to agree that \\nshe was absolutely right. Her disapproval was clear, but all she said was,I \\nwon’t envy you in the morning.\\nNo,groaned Eragon,but \\nBrom will. He drank twice as much as I did.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 32': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT RAIL OFOIL\\nW hat was I \\nthinking?wondered Eragon in the morning. His head was pounding and his \\ntongue felt thick and fuzzy. As a rat skittered under the floor, Eragon winced \\nat the noise.\\nHow are we \\nfeeling?asked \\nSaphira smugly.\\nEragon ignored \\nher.\\nA moment later, \\nBrom rolled out of bed with a grumble. He doused his head in cold water from \\nthe basin, then left the room. Eragon followed him into the hallway. “Where are \\nyou going?” he asked.\\n“To recover.”\\n“I’ll come.” At \\nthe bar, Eragon discovered that Brom’s method of recovery involved imbibing \\ncopious amounts of hot tea and ice water and washing it all down with brandy. \\nWhen they returned to the room, Eragon was able to function somewhat better.\\nBrom belted on \\nhis sword and smoothed the wrinkles out of his robe. “The first thing we need \\nto do is ask some discreet questions. I want to find out where the Seithr oil \\nwas delivered in Dras-Leona and where it was taken from there. Most likely, \\nsoldiers or workmen were involved in transporting it. We have to find those men \\nand get one to talk.”\\nThey left the \\nGolden Globe and searched for warehouses where the Seithr oil might have been \\ndelivered. Near the center of Dras-Leona, the streets began to slant upward \\ntoward a palace of polished granite. It was built on a rise so that it towered \\nabove every building except the cathedral.\\nThe courtyard \\nwas a mosaic of mother-of-pearl, and parts of the walls were inlaid with gold. \\nBlack statues stood in alcoves, with sticks of incense smoking in their cold \\nhands. Soldiers stationed every four yards watched passersby keenly.\\n“Who lives \\nthere?” asked Eragon in awe.\\n“Marcus Tábor, \\nruler of this city. He answers only to the king and his own conscience, which \\nhasn’t been very active recently,” said Brom. They walked around the palace, \\nlooking at the gated, ornate houses that surrounded it.\\nBy midday they \\nhad learned nothing useful, so they stopped for lunch. “This city is too vast \\nfor us to comb it together,” said Brom. “Search on your own. Meet me at the \\nGolden Globe by dusk.” He glowered at Eragon from under his bushy eyebrows. \\n“I’m trusting you not to do anything stupid.”\\n“I won’t,” \\npromised Eragon. Brom handed him some coins, then strode away in the opposite \\ndirection.\\nThroughout the \\nrest of the day, Eragon talked with shopkeepers and workers, trying to be as \\npleasant and charming as he could. His questions led him from one end of the \\ncity to the other and back again. No one seemed to know about the oil. Wherever \\nhe went, the cathedral stared down at him. It was impossible to escape its tall \\nspires.\\nAt last he found \\na man who had helped ship the Seithr oil and remembered to which warehouse it \\nhad been taken. Eragon excitedly went to look at the building, then returned to \\nthe Golden Globe. It was over an hour before Brom came back, slumped with \\nfatigue. “Did you find anything?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom brushed \\nback his white hair. “I heard a great deal of interesting things today, not the \\nleast of which is that Galbatorix will visit Dras-Leona within the week.”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed Eragon.\\nBrom slouched \\nagainst the wall, the lines on his forehead deepening. “It seems that Tábor has \\ntaken a few too many liberties with his power, so Galbatorix has decided to \\ncome teach him a lesson in humility. It’s the first time the king has left \\nUrû’baen in over ten years.”\\n“Do you think he \\nknows of us?” asked Eragon.\\n“Of course heknows \\nof us, but I’m sure he hasn’t been told our location. If he had, we would \\nalready be in the Ra’zac’s grasp. However, this means that whatever we’re going \\nto do about the Ra’zac must be accomplished before Galbatorix arrives. We don’t \\nwant to be anywhere within twenty leagues of him. The one thing in our favor is \\nthat the Ra’zac are sure to be here, preparing for his visit.”\\n“I want to get \\nthe Ra’zac,” said Eragon, his fists tightening, “but not if it means fighting \\nthe king. He could probably tear me to pieces.”\\nThat seemed to \\namuse Brom. “Very good: caution. And you’re right; you wouldn’t stand a chance \\nagainst Galbatorix. Now tell me what you learned today. It might confirm what I \\nheard.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“It was mostly drivel, but I did talk with a man who knew where the oil was \\ntaken. It’s just an old warehouse. Other than that, I didn’t discover anything \\nuseful.”\\n“My day was a \\nlittle more fruitful than yours. I heard the same thing you did, so I went to \\nthe warehouse and talked with the workers. It didn’t take much cajoling before \\nthey revealed that the cases of Seithr oil are always sent from the warehouse \\nto the palace.”\\n“And that’s when \\nyou came back here,” finished Eragon.\\n“No, it’s not! \\nDon’t interrupt. After that, I went to the palace and got myself invited into \\nthe servants’ quarters as a bard. For several hours I wandered about, amusing \\nthe maids and others with songs and poems—and asking questions all the while.” \\nBrom slowly filled his pipe with tobacco. “It’s really amazing all the things \\nservants find out. Did you know that one of the earls hasthree mistresses, \\nand they all live in the same wing of the palace?” He shook his head and lit \\nthe pipe. “Aside from the fascinating tidbits, I was told, quite by accident, \\nwhere the oil is taken from the palace.”\\n“And that is . . \\n. ?” asked Eragon impatiently.\\nBrom puffed on \\nhis pipe and blew a smoke ring. “Out of the city, of course. Every full moon \\ntwo slaves are sent to the base of Helgrind with a month’s worth of provisions. \\nWhenever the Seithr oil arrives in Dras-Leona, they send it along with the \\nprovisions. The slaves are never seen again. And the one time someone followed \\nthem, he disappeared too.”\\n“I thought the \\nRiders demolished the slave trade,” said Eragon.\\n“Unfortunately, \\nit has flourished under the king’s reign.”\\n“So the Ra’zac \\nare in Helgrind,” said Eragon, thinking of the rock mountain.\\n“There or \\nsomewhere nearby.”\\n“If theyare \\nin Helgrind, they’ll be either at the bottom—and protected by a thick stone \\ndoor—or higher up where only their flying mounts, or Saphira, can reach. Top or \\nbottom, their shelter will no doubt be disguised.” He thought for a moment. “If \\nSaphira and I go flying around Helgrind, the Ra’zac are sure to see us—not to \\nmention all of Dras-Leona.”\\n“It is a \\nproblem,” agreed Brom.\\nEragon frowned. \\n“What if we took the place of the two slaves? The full moon isn’t far off. It \\nwould give us a perfect opportunity to get close to the Ra’zac.”\\nBrom tugged his \\nbeard thoughtfully. “That’s chancy at best. If the slaves are killed from a \\ndistance, we’ll be in trouble. We can’t harm the Ra’zac if they aren’t in \\nsight.”\\n“We don’t know \\nif the slaves are killed at all,” Eragon pointed out.\\n“I’m sure they \\nare,” said Brom, his face grave. Then his eyes sparkled, and he blew another \\nsmoke ring. “Still, it’s an intriguing idea. If it were done with Saphira \\nhidden nearby and a . . .” His voice trailed off. “It might work, but we’ll \\nhave to move quickly. With the king coming, there isn’t much time.”\\n“Should we go to \\nHelgrind and look around? It would be good to see the land in daylight so we \\nwon’t be surprised by any ambushes,” said Eragon.\\nBrom fingered \\nhis staff. “That can be done later. Tomorrow I’ll return to the palace and \\nfigure out how we can replace the slaves. I have to be careful not to arouse \\nsuspicion, though—I could easily be revealed by spies and courtiers who know \\nabout the Ra’zac.”\\n“I can’t believe \\nit; we actually found them,” said Eragon quietly. An image of his dead uncle \\nand burned farm flashed through his mind. His jaw tightened.\\n“The toughest \\npart is yet to come, but yes, we’ve done well,” said Brom. “If fortune smiles \\non us, you may soon have your revenge and the Varden will be rid of a dangerous \\nenemy. What comes after that will be up to you.”\\nEragon opened \\nhis mind and jubilantly told Saphira,We found the Ra’zac’s lair!\\nWhere?He quickly \\nexplained what they had discovered.Helgrind, she mused.A fitting \\nplace for them.\\nEragon agreed.When \\nwe’re done here, maybe we could visit Carvahall.\\nWhat is it you \\nwant?she \\nasked, suddenly sour.To go back to your previous life? You know that won’t \\nhappen, so stop mooning after it! At a certain point you have to decide what to \\ncommit to. Will you hide for the rest of your life, or will you help the \\nVarden? Those are the only options left to you, unless you join forces with \\nGalbatorix, which I do not and never will accept.\\nSoftly, he said, \\nIf I must choose, I cast my fate with the Varden, as you well know.\\nYes, but \\nsometimes you have to hear yourself say it.She left him to ponder her words.\\nWo RSHIPERS OFHELGRIND\\nEragon was alone \\nin the room when he woke. Scrawled onto the wall with a charcoal stick was a \\nnote that read:\\n\\xa0\\nEragon, \\n\\xa0\\nI will be gone \\nuntil late tonight. Coins for food are under the mattress. Explore the city, \\nenjoy yourself, butstay unnoticed! \\n\\xa0\\nBrom \\n\\xa0\\nP.S. Avoid the \\npalace. Don’t go anywhere without your bow! Keep it strung. \\n\\xa0\\nEragon wiped the \\nwall clean, then retrieved the money from under the bed. He slipped the bow \\nacross his back, thinking,I wish I didn’t have to go armed all the time.\\nHe left the \\nGolden Globe and ambled through the streets, stopping to observe whatever \\ninterested him. There were many intriguing stores, but none quite as exciting \\nas Angela’s herb shop in Teirm. At times he glared at the dark, claustrophobic \\nhouses and wished that he were free of the city. When he grew hungry, he bought \\na wedge of cheese and a loaf of bread and ate them, sitting on a curb.\\nLater, in a far \\ncorner of Dras-Leona, he heard an auctioneer rattling off a list of prices. \\nCurious, he headed toward the voice and arrived at a wide opening between two \\nbuildings. Ten men stood on a waist-high platform. Arrayed before them was a \\nrichly dressed crowd that was both colorful and boisterous.Where are the \\ngoods for sale? wondered Eragon.\\nThe auctioneer \\nfinished his list and motioned for a young man behind the platform to join him. \\nThe man awkwardly climbed up, chains dragging at his hands and feet. “And here \\nwe have our first item,” proclaimed the auctioneer. “A healthy male from the \\nHadarac Desert, captured just last month, and in excellent condition. Look at \\nthose arms and legs; he’s strong as a bull! He’d be perfect as a shield bearer, \\nor, if you don’t trust him for that, hard labor. But let me tell you, lords and \\nladies, that would be a waste. He’s bright as a nail, if you can get him to \\ntalk a civilized tongue!”\\nThe crowd \\nlaughed, and Eragon ground his teeth with fury. His lips started to form a word \\nthat would free the slave, and his arm, newly liberated from the splint, rose. \\nThe mark on his palm shimmered. He was about to release the magic when it \\nstruck him,He’d never get away! The slave would be caught before he \\nreached the city walls. Eragon would only make the situation worse if he tried \\nto help. He lowered his arm and quietly cursed.Think! This is how you got \\ninto trouble with the Urgals.\\nHe watched \\nhelplessly as the slave was sold to a tall, hawk-nosed man. The next slave was \\na tiny girl, no more than six years old, wrenched from the arms of her crying mother. \\nAs the auctioneer started the bidding, Eragon forced himself to walk away, \\nrigid with fury and outrage.\\nIt was several \\nblocks before the weeping was inaudible.I’d like to see a thief try to cut \\nmy purse right now, he thought grimly, almost wishing it would happen. \\nFrustrated, he punched a nearby wall, bruising his knuckles.\\nThat’s the sort \\nof thing I could stop by fighting the Empire,he realized. With Saphira by \\nmy side I could free those slaves. I’ve been graced with special powers; it \\nwould be selfish of me not to use them for the benefit of others. If I don’t, I \\nmight as well not be a Rider at all.\\nIt was a while \\nbefore he took stock of his bearings and was surprised to find himself before \\nthe cathedral. Its twisted spires were covered with statues and scrollwork. \\nSnarling gargoyles crouched along the eaves. Fantastic beasts writhed on the \\nwalls, and heroes and kings marched along their bottom edges, frozen in cold \\nmarble. Ribbed arches and tall stained-glass windows lined the cathedral’s \\nsides, along with columns of differing sizes. A lonely turret helmed the \\nbuilding like a mast.\\nRecessed in \\nshadow at the cathedral’s front was an iron-bound door inlaid with a row of \\nsilver script that Eragon recognized as the ancient language. As best he could \\ntell, it read:May thee who enter here understand thine impermanence and \\nforget thine attachments to that which is beloved.\\nThe entire \\nbuilding sent a shiver down Eragon’s spine. There was something menacing about \\nit, as if it were a predator crouched in the city, waiting for its next victim.\\nA broad row of \\nsteps led to the cathedral’s entrance. Eragon solemnly ascended them and \\nstopped before the door.I wonder if I can go in? Almost guiltily he \\npushed on the door. It swung open smoothly, gliding on oiled hinges. He stepped \\ninside.\\nThe silence of a \\nforgotten tomb filled the empty cathedral. The air was chill and dry. Bare \\nwalls extended to a vaulted ceiling that was so high Eragon felt no taller than \\nan ant. Stained-glass windows depicting scenes of anger, hate, and remorse \\npierced the walls, while spectral beams of light washed sections of the granite \\npews with transparent hues, leaving the rest in shadow. His hands were shaded a \\ndeep blue.\\nBetween the \\nwindows stood statues with rigid, pale eyes. He returned their stern gazes, \\nthen slowly trod up the center row, afraid to break the quiet. His leather \\nboots padded noiselessly on the polished stone floor.\\nThe altar was a \\ngreat slab of stone devoid of adornment. A solitary finger of light fell upon \\nit, illuminating motes of golden dust floating in the air. Behind the altar, \\nthe pipes of a wind organ pierced the ceiling and opened themselves to the \\nelements. The instrument would play its music only when a gale rocked \\nDras-Leona.\\nOut of respect, \\nEragon knelt before the altar and bowed his head. He did not pray but paid \\nhomage to the cathedral itself. The sorrows of the lives it had witnessed, as \\nwell as the unpleasantness of the elaborate pageantry that played out between \\nits walls, emanated from the stones. It was a forbidding place, bare and cold. \\nIn that chilling touch, though, came a glimpse of eternity and perhaps the \\npowers that lay there.\\nFinally Eragon \\ninclined his head and rose. Calm and grave, he whispered words to himself in \\nthe ancient language, then turned to leave. He froze. His heart jumped, \\nhammering like a drum.\\nThe Ra’zac stood \\nat the cathedral’s entrance, watching him. Their swords were drawn, keen edges \\nbloody in a crimson light. A sibilant hiss came from the smaller Ra’zac. \\nNeither of them moved.\\nRage welled up \\nin Eragon. He had chased the Ra’zac for so many weeks that the pain of their \\nmurderous deed had dulled within him. But his vengeance was at hand. His wrath \\nexploded like a volcano, fueled even more by his pent-up fury at the slaves’ \\nplight. A roar broke from his lips, echoing like a thunderstorm as he snatched \\nhis bow from his back. Deftly, he fit an arrow to the string and loosed it. Two \\nmore followed an instant later.\\nThe Ra’zac leapt \\naway from the arrows with inhuman swiftness. They hissed as they ran up the \\naisle between the pews, cloaks flapping like raven wings. Eragon reached for \\nanother arrow, but caution stayed his hand.If they knew where to find me, \\nBrom is in danger as well! I must warn him! Then, to Eragon’s horror, a \\nline of soldiers filed into the cathedral, and he glimpsed a field of uniforms \\njostling outside the doorway.\\nEragon gazed \\nhungrily at the charging Ra’zac, then swept around, searching for means of \\nescape. A vestibule to the left of the altar caught his attention. He bounded \\nthrough the archway and dashed down a corridor that led to a priory with a \\nbelfry. The patter of the Ra’zac’s feet behind him made him quicken his pace \\nuntil the hall abruptly ended with a closed door.\\nHe pounded \\nagainst it, trying to break it open, but the wood was too strong. The Ra’zac \\nwere nearly upon him. Frantic, he sucked in his breath and barked, “Jierda!” \\nWith a flash, the door splintered into pieces and fell to the floor. Eragon \\njumped into the small room and continued running.\\nHe sped through \\nseveral chambers, startling a group of priests. Shouts and curses followed him. \\nThe priory bell tolled an alarm. Eragon dodged through a kitchen, passed a pair \\nof monks, then slipped through a side door. He skidded to stop in a garden \\nsurrounded by a high brick wall devoid of handholds. There were no other exits.\\nEragon turned to \\nleave, but there was a low hiss as the Ra’zac shouldered aside the door. \\nDesperate, he rushed at the wall, arms pumping. Magic could not help him \\nhere—if he used it to break through the wall, he would be too tired to run.\\nHe jumped. Even \\nwith his arms outstretched, only his fingertips cleared the edge of the wall. \\nThe rest of his body smashed against the bricks, driving out his breath. Eragon \\ngasped and hung there, struggling not to fall. The Ra’zac prowled into the \\ngarden, swinging their heads from side to side like wolfhounds sniffing for \\nprey.\\nEragon sensed \\ntheir approach and heaved with his arms. His shoulders shrieked with pain as he \\nscrambled onto the wall and dropped to the other side. He stumbled, then \\nregained his balance and darted down an alley just as the Ra’zac leapt over the \\nwall. Galvanized, Eragon put on another burst of speed.\\nHe ran for over \\na mile before he had to stop and catch his breath. Unsure if he had lost the \\nRa’zac, he found a crowded marketplace and dived under a parked wagon.How \\ndid they find me? he wondered, panting.They shouldn’t have known where I \\nwas . . . unless something happened to Brom! He reached out with his mind \\nto Saphira and said,The Ra’zac found me. We’re all in danger! Check if \\nBrom’s all right. If he is, warn him and have him meet me at the inn. And be \\nready to fly here as fast as you can. We may need your help to escape.\\nShe was silent, then \\nsaid curtly,He’ll meet you at the inn. Don’t stop moving; you’re in great \\ndanger.\\n“Don’t I know \\nit,” muttered Eragon as he rolled out from under the wagon. He hurried back to \\nthe Golden Globe, quickly packed their belongings, saddled the horses, then led \\nthem to the street. Brom soon arrived, staff in hand, scowling dangerously. He \\nswung onto Snowfire and asked, “What happened?”\\n“I was in the \\ncathedral when the Ra’zac just appeared behind me,” said Eragon, climbing onto \\nCadoc. “I ran back as fast as possible, but they could be here at any second. \\nSaphira will join us once we’re out of Dras-Leona.”\\n“We have to get \\noutside the city walls before they close the gates, if they haven’t already,” \\nsaid Brom. “If they’re shut, it’ll be nigh impossible for us to leave. Whatever \\nyou do, don’t get separated from me.” Eragon stiffened as ranks of soldiers \\nmarched down one end of the street.\\nBrom cursed, \\nlashed Snowfire with his reins, and galloped away. Eragon bent low over Cadoc \\nand followed. They nearly crashed several times during the wild, hazardous \\nride, plunging through masses of people that clogged the streets as they neared \\nthe city wall. When the gates finally came into view, Eragon pulled on Cadoc’s \\nreins with dismay. The gates were already half closed, and a double line of \\npikemen blocked their way.\\n“They’ll cut us \\nto pieces!” he exclaimed.\\n“We have to try \\nand make it,” said Brom, his voice hard. “I’ll deal with the men, but you have \\nto keep the gates open for us.” Eragon nodded, gritted his teeth, and dug his \\nheels into Cadoc.\\nThey plowed \\ntoward the line of unwavering soldiers, who lowered their pikes toward the \\nhorses’ chests and braced the weapons against the ground. Though the horses \\nsnorted with fear, Eragon and Brom held them in place. Eragon heard the soldiers \\nshout but kept his attention on the gates inching shut.\\nAs they neared \\nthe sharp pikes, Brom raised his hand and spoke. The words struck with \\nprecision; the soldiers fell to each side as if their legs had been cut out \\nfrom under them. The gap between the gates shrank by the second. Hoping that \\nthe effort would not prove too much for him, Eragon drew on his power and \\nshouted, “Du grind huildr!”\\nA deep grating \\nsound emanated from the gates as they trembled, then ground to a stop. The \\ncrowd and guards fell silent, staring with amazement. With a clatter of the \\nhorses’ hooves, Brom and Eragon shot out from behind Dras-Leona’s wall. The \\ninstant they were free, Eragon released the gates. They shuddered, then boomed \\nshut.\\nHe swayed with \\nthe expected fatigue but managed to keep riding. Brom watched him with concern. \\nTheir flight continued through the outskirts of Dras-Leona as alarm trumpets \\nsounded on the city wall. Saphira was waiting for them by the edge of the city, \\nhidden behind some trees. Her eyes burned; her tail whipped back and forth. \\n“Go, ride her,” said Brom. “And this time stay in the air, no matter what \\nhappens to me. I’ll head south. Fly nearby; I don’t care if Saphira’s seen.” \\nEragon quickly mounted Saphira. As the ground dwindled away beneath him, he \\nwatched Brom gallop along the road.\\nAre you all \\nright?asked \\nSaphira.\\nYes,said Eragon.But \\nonly because we were very lucky.\\nA puff of smoke \\nblew from her nostrils.All the time we’ve spent searching for the Ra’zac was \\nuseless.\\nI know,he said, letting \\nhis head sag against her scales.If the Ra’zac had been the only enemies back \\nthere, I would have stayed and fought, but with all the soldiers on their side, \\nit was hardly a fair match!\\nYou understand \\nthat there will be talk of us now? This was hardly an unobtrusive escape. \\nEvading the Empire will be harder than ever.There was an edge to her voice \\nthat he was unaccustomed to.\\nI know. \\nThey flew low \\nand fast over the road. Leona Lake receded behind them; the land became dry and \\nrocky and filled with tough, sharp bushes and tall cactuses. Clouds darkened \\nthe sky. Lightning flashed in the distance. As the wind began to howl, Saphira \\nglided steeply down to Brom. He stopped the horses and asked, “What’s wrong?”\\n“The wind’s too \\nstrong.”\\n“It’s not that \\nbad,” objected Brom.\\n“It is up \\nthere,” said Eragon, pointing at the sky.\\nBrom swore and \\nhanded him Cadoc’s reins. They trotted away with Saphira following on foot, \\nthough on the ground she had difficulty keeping up with the horses.\\nThe gale grew \\nstronger, flinging dirt through the air and twisting like a dervish. They \\nwrapped scarves around their heads to protect their eyes. Brom’s robe flapped \\nin the wind while his beard whipped about as if it had a life of its own. \\nThough it would make them miserable, Eragon hoped it would rain so their tracks \\nwould be obliterated.\\nSoon darkness \\nforced them to stop. With only the stars to guide them, they left the road and \\nmade camp behind two boulders. It was too dangerous to light a fire, so they \\nate cold food while Saphira sheltered them from the wind.\\nAfter the sparse \\ndinner, Eragon asked bluntly, “How did they find us?”\\nBrom started to \\nlight his pipe, but thought better of it and put it away. “One of the palace \\nservants warned me there were spies among them. Somehow word of me and my \\nquestions must have reached Tábor . . . and through him, the Ra’zac.”\\n“We can’t go \\nback to Dras-Leona, can we?” asked Eragon.\\nBrom shook his \\nhead. “Not for a few years.”\\nEragon held his \\nhead between his hands. “Then should we draw the Ra’zac out? If we let Saphira \\nbe seen, they’ll come running to wherever she is.”\\n“And when they \\ndo, there will be fifty soldiers with them,” said Brom. “At any rate, this \\nisn’t the time to discuss it. Right now we have to concentrate on staying \\nalive. Tonight will be the most dangerous because the Ra’zac will be hunting us \\nin the dark, when they are strongest. We’ll have to trade watches until \\nmorning.”\\n“Right,” said \\nEragon, standing. He hesitated and squinted. His eyes had caught a flicker of \\nmovement, a small patch of color that stood out from the surrounding \\nnightscape. He stepped toward the edge of their camp, trying to see it better.\\n“What is it?” \\nasked Brom as he unrolled his blankets.\\nEragon stared \\ninto the darkness, then turned back. “I don’t know. I thought I saw something. \\nIt must have been a bird.” Pain erupted in the back of his head, and Saphira \\nroared. Then Eragon toppled to the ground, unconscious.\\nT HERA’ZAC’SREVENGE\\nAdull throbbing \\nroused Eragon. Every time blood pulsed through his head it brought a fresh wave \\nof pain. He cracked his eyes open and winced; tears rushed to his eyes as he \\nlooked directly into a bright lantern. He blinked and looked away. When he \\ntried to sit up, he realized that his hands were tied behind his back.\\nHe turned \\nlethargically and saw Brom’s arms. Eragon was relieved to see that they were \\nbound together. Why was that? He struggled to figure it out until the thought \\nsuddenly came to him,They wouldn’t tie up a dead man! But then who were \\n“they”? He swiveled his head further, then stopped as a pair of black boots \\nentered his vision.\\nEragon looked \\nup, right into the cowled face of a Ra’zac. Fear jolted through him. He reached \\nfor the magic and started to voice a word that would kill the Ra’zac, but then \\nhalted, puzzled. He could not remember the word. Frustrated, he tried again, \\nonly to feel it slip out of his grasp.\\nAbove him the \\nRa’zac laughed chillingly. “The drug is working, yesss? I think you will not be \\nbothering us again.”\\nThere was a \\nrattle off to the left, and Eragon was appalled to see the second Ra’zac fit a \\nmuzzle over Saphira’s head. Her wings were pinioned to her sides by black \\nchains; there were shackles on her legs. Eragon tried to contact her, but felt \\nnothing.\\n“She was most \\ncooperative once we threatened to kill you,” hissed the Ra’zac. Squatting by \\nthe lantern, he rummaged through Eragon’s bags, examining and discarding \\nvarious items until he removed Zar’roc. “What a pretty thing for one so . . . \\ninsignificant. Maybe I will keep it.” He leaned closer and sneered, “Or maybe, \\nif you behave, our master will let you polish it.” His moist breath smelled \\nlike raw meat.\\nThen he turned \\nthe sword over in his hands and screeched as he saw the symbol on the scabbard. \\nHis companion rushed over. They stood over the sword, hissing and clicking. At \\nlast they faced Eragon. “You will serve our master very well, yesss.”\\nEragon forced \\nhis thick tongue to form words: “If I do, I will kill you.”\\nThey chuckled \\ncoldly. “Oh no, we are too valuable. But you . . . you aredisposable. ” \\nA deep snarl came from Saphira; smoke roiled from her nostrils. The Ra’zac did \\nnot seem to care.\\nTheir attention \\nwas diverted when Brom groaned and rolled onto his side. One of the Ra’zac \\ngrabbed his shirt and thrust him effortlessly into the air. “It’sss wearing \\noff.”\\n“Give him more.”\\n“Let’sss just \\nkill him,” said the shorter Ra’zac. “He has caused us much grief.”\\nThe taller one \\nran his finger down his sword. “A good plan. But remember, the king’s \\ninstructions were to keep themalive. ”\\n“We can sssay he \\nwas killed when we captured them.”\\n“And what of \\nthisss one?” the Ra’zac asked, pointing his sword at Eragon. “If he talksss?”\\nHis companion \\nlaughed and drew a wicked dagger. “He would not dare.”\\nThere was a long \\nsilence, then, “Agreed.”\\nThey dragged \\nBrom to the center of the camp and shoved him to his knees. Brom sagged to one \\nside. Eragon watched with growing fear.I have to get free! He wrenched \\nat the ropes, but they were too strong to break. “None of that now,” said the \\ntall Ra’zac, poking him with a sword. He nosed the air and sniffed; something \\nseemed to trouble him.\\nThe other Ra’zac \\ngrowled, yanked Brom’s head back, and swept the dagger toward his exposed \\nthroat. At that very moment a low buzz sounded, followed by the Ra’zac’s howl. \\nAn arrow protruded from his shoulder. The Ra’zac nearest Eragon dropped to the \\nground, barely avoiding a second arrow. He scuttled to his wounded companion, \\nand they glared into the darkness, hissing angrily. They made no move to stop \\nBrom as he blearily staggered upright. “Get down!” cried Eragon.\\nBrom wavered, \\nthen tottered toward Eragon. As more arrows hissed into the camp from the \\nunseen attackers, the Ra’zac rolled behind some boulders. There was a lull, \\nthen arrows came from the opposite direction. Caught by surprise, the Ra’zac \\nreacted slowly. Their cloaks were pierced in several places, and a shattered \\narrow buried itself in one’s arm.\\nWith a wild cry, \\nthe smaller Ra’zac fled toward the road, kicking Eragon viciously in the side \\nas he passed. His companion hesitated, then grabbed the dagger from the ground \\nand raced after him. As he left the camp, he hurled the knife at Eragon.\\nA strange light \\nsuddenly burned in Brom’s eyes. He threw himself in front of Eragon, his mouth \\nopen in a soundless snarl. The dagger struck him with a soft thump, and he \\nlanded heavily on his shoulder. His head lolled limply.\\n“No!” screamed \\nEragon, though he was doubled over in pain. He heard footsteps, then his eyes \\nclosed and he knew no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 33': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nM URTAGH \\nFor a long while, \\nEragon was aware only of the burning in his side. Each breath was painful. It \\nfelt as though he had been the one stabbed, not Brom. His sense of time was \\nskewed; it was hard to tell if weeks had gone by, or only a few minutes. When \\nconsciousness finally came to him, he opened his eyes and peered curiously at a \\ncampfire several feet away. His hands were still tied together, but the drug \\nmust have worn off because he could think clearly again.Saphira, are you \\ninjured?\\nNo, but you and \\nBrom are.She \\nwas crouched over Eragon, wings spread protectively on either side.\\nSaphira, you \\ndidn’t make that fire, did you? And you couldn’t have gotten out of those \\nchains by yourself.\\n\\nNo. \\nI didn’t think \\nso.Eragon \\nstruggled to his knees and saw a young man sitting on the far side of the fire.\\nThe stranger, \\ndressed in battered clothes, exuded a calm, assured air. In his hands was a \\nbow, at his side a long hand-and-a-half sword. A white horn bound with silver \\nfittings lay in his lap, and the hilt of a dagger protruded from his boot. His \\nserious face and fierce eyes were framed by locks of brown hair. He appeared to \\nbe a few years older than Eragon and perhaps an inch or so taller. Behind him a \\ngray war-horse was picketed. The stranger watched Saphira warily.\\n“Who are you?” \\nasked Eragon, taking a shallow breath.\\nThe man’s hands \\ntightened on his bow. “Murtagh.” His voice was low and controlled, but \\ncuriously emotional.\\nEragon pulled \\nhis hands underneath his legs so they were in front of him. He clenched his \\nteeth as his side flared with pain. “Why did you help us?”\\n“You aren’t the \\nonly enemies the Ra’zac have. I was tracking them.”\\n“You know who \\nthey are?”\\n“Yes.”\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on the ropes that bound his wrists and reached for the magic. He \\nhesitated, aware of Murtagh’s eyes on him, then decided it didn’t matter. \\n“Jierda!” he grunted. The ropes snapped off his wrists. He rubbed his hands to \\nget the blood flowing.\\nMurtagh sucked \\nin his breath. Eragon braced himself and tried to stand, but his ribs seared \\nwith agony. He fell back, gasping between clenched teeth. Murtagh tried to come \\nto his aid, but Saphira stopped him with a growl. “I would have helped you \\nearlier, but your dragon wouldn’t let me near you.”\\n“Her name’s Saphira,” \\nsaid Eragon tightly.Now let him by! I can’t do this alone. Besides, he saved \\nour lives. Saphira growled again, but folded her wings and backed away. \\nMurtagh eyed her flatly as he stepped forward.\\nHe grasped \\nEragon’s arm, gently pulling him to his feet. Eragon yelped and would have \\nfallen without support. They went to the fire, where Brom lay on his back. “How \\nis he?” asked Eragon.\\n“Bad,” said \\nMurtagh, lowering him to the ground. “The knife went right between his ribs. \\nYou can look at him in a minute, but first we’d better see how much damage the \\nRa’zac did to you.” He helped Eragon remove his shirt, then whistled. “Ouch!”\\n“Ouch,” agreed \\nEragon weakly. A blotchy bruise extended down his left side. The red, swollen \\nskin was broken in several places. Murtagh put a hand on the bruise and pressed \\nlightly. Eragon yelled, and Saphira growled a warning.\\nMurtagh glanced \\nat Saphira as he grabbed a blanket. “I think you have some broken ribs. It’s \\nhard to tell, but at least two, maybe more. You’re lucky you’re not coughing up \\nblood.” He tore the blanket into strips and bound Eragon’s chest.\\nEragon slipped \\nthe shirt back on. “Yes . . . I’m lucky.” He took a shallow breath, sidled over \\nto Brom, and saw that Murtagh had cut open the side of his robe to bandage the wound. \\nWith trembling fingers, he undid the bandage.\\n“I wouldn’t do \\nthat,” warned Murtagh. “He’ll bleed to death without it.”\\nEragon ignored \\nhim and pulled the cloth away from Brom’s side. The wound was short and thin, \\nbelying its depth. Blood streamed out of it. As he had learned when Garrow was \\ninjured, a wound inflicted by the Ra’zac was slow to heal.\\nHe peeled off \\nhis gloves while furiously searching his mind for the healing words Brom had \\ntaught him.Help me, Saphira, he implored.I am too weak to do this \\nalone.\\nSaphira crouched \\nnext to him, fixing her eyes on Brom.I am here, Eragon. As her mind \\njoined his, new strength infused his body. Eragon drew upon their combined \\npower and focused it on the words. His hand trembled as he held it over the \\nwound. “Waíse heill!” he said. His palm glowed, and Brom’s skin flowed \\ntogether, as if it had never been broken. Murtagh watched the entire process.\\nIt was over \\nquickly. As the light vanished, Eragon sat, feeling sick.We’ve never done \\nthat before, he said.\\nSaphira nodded.Together \\nwe can cast spells that are beyond either of us.\\nMurtagh examined \\nBrom’s side and asked, “Is he completely healed?”\\n“I can only mend \\nwhat is on the surface. I don’t know enough to fix whatever’s damaged inside. \\nIt’s up to him now. I’ve done all I can.” Eragon closed his eyes for a moment, \\nutterly weary. “My . . . my head seems to be floating in clouds.”\\n“You probably \\nneed to eat,” said Murtagh. “I’ll make soup.”\\nWhile Murtagh \\nfixed the meal, Eragon wondered who this stranger was. His sword and bow were \\nof the finest make, as was his horn. Either he was a thief or accustomed to \\nmoney—and lots of it.Why was he hunting the Ra’zac? What have they done to \\nmake him an enemy? I wonder if he works for the Varden?\\nMurtagh handed \\nhim a bowl of broth. Eragon spooned it down and asked, “How long has it been \\nsince the Ra’zac fled?”\\n“A few hours.”\\n“We have to go \\nbefore they return with reinforcements.”\\n“You might be \\nable to travel,” said Murtagh, then gestured at Brom, “but he can’t. You don’t \\nget up and ride away after being stabbed between the ribs.”\\nIf we make a \\nlitter, can you carry Brom with your claws like you did with Garrow?Eragon asked \\nSaphira.\\nYes, but landing \\nwill be awkward.\\n\\nAs long as it \\ncan be done.Eragon \\nsaid to Murtagh, “Saphira can carry him, but we need a litter. Can you make \\none? I don’t have the strength.”\\n“Wait here.” \\nMurtagh left the camp, sword drawn. Eragon hobbled to his bags and picked up \\nhis bow from where it had been thrown by the Ra’zac. He strung it, found his \\nquiver, then retrieved Zar’roc, which lay hidden in shadow. Last, he got a \\nblanket for the litter.\\nMurtagh returned \\nwith two saplings. He laid them parallel on the ground, then lashed the blanket \\nbetween the poles. After he carefully tied Brom to the makeshift litter, \\nSaphira grasped the saplings and laboriously took flight. “I never thought I \\nwould see a sight like that,” Murtagh said, an odd note in his voice.\\nAs Saphira \\ndisappeared into the dark sky, Eragon limped to Cadoc and hoisted himself \\npainfully into the saddle. “Thanks for helping us. You should leave now. Ride \\nas far away from us as you can. You’ll be in danger if the Empire finds you \\nwith us. We can’t protect you, and I wouldn’t see harm come to you on our \\naccount.”\\n“A pretty \\nspeech,” said Murtagh, grinding out the fire, “but where will you go? Is there \\na place nearby that you can rest in safety?”\\n“No,” admitted \\nEragon.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nglinted as he fingered the hilt of his sword. “In that case, I think I’ll \\naccompany you until you’re out of danger. I’ve no better place to be. Besides, \\nif I stay with you, I might get another shot at the Ra’zac sooner than if I \\nwere on my own. Interesting things are bound to happen around a Rider.”\\nEragon wavered, \\nunsure if he should accept help from a complete stranger. Yet he was \\nunpleasantly aware that he was too weak to force the issue either way.If \\nMurtagh proves untrustworthy, Saphira can always chase him away. “Join us \\nif you wish.” He shrugged.\\nMurtagh nodded \\nand mounted his gray war-horse. Eragon grabbed Snowfire’s reins and rode away \\nfrom the camp, into the wilderness. An oxbow moon provided wan light, but he \\nknew that it would only make it easier for the Ra’zac to track them.\\nThough Eragon \\nwanted to question Murtagh further, he kept silent, conserving his energy for riding. \\nNear dawn Saphira said,I must stop. My wings are tired and Brom needs \\nattention. I discovered a good place to stay, about two miles ahead of where \\nyou are.\\nThey found her \\nsitting at the base of a broad sandstone formation that curved out of the ground \\nlike a great hill. Its sides were pocked with caves of varying sizes. Similar \\ndomes were scattered across the land. Saphira looked pleased with herself.I \\nfound a cave that can’t be seen from the ground. It’s large enough for all of \\nus, including the horses. Follow me. She turned and climbed up the \\nsandstone, her sharp claws digging into the rock. The horses had difficulty, as \\ntheir shod hooves could not grip the sandstone. Eragon and Murtagh had to pull \\nand shove the animals for almost an hour before they managed to reach the cave.\\nThe cavern was a \\ngood hundred feet long and more than twenty feet wide, yet it had a small \\nopening that would protect them from bad weather and prying eyes. Darkness \\nswallowed the far end, clinging to the walls like mats of soft black wool.\\n“Impressive,” \\nsaid Murtagh. “I’ll gather wood for a fire.” Eragon hurried to Brom. Saphira \\nhad set him on a small rock ledge at the rear of the cave. Eragon clasped \\nBrom’s limp hand and anxiously watched his craggy face. After a few minutes, he \\nsighed and went to the fire Murtagh had built.\\nThey ate \\nquietly, then tried to give Brom water, but the old man would not drink. \\nStymied, they spread out their bedrolls and slept.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 34': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nL EGACY OF ARIDER\\nWake up, Eragon.He stirred and \\ngroaned.\\nI need your help.Something \\nis wrong!Eragon \\ntried to ignore the voice and return to sleep.\\nArise! \\nGo away,he grumbled.\\nEragon!A bellow rang in \\nthe cave. He bolted upright, fumbling for his bow. Saphira was crouched over \\nBrom, who had rolled off the ledge and was thrashing on the cave floor. His \\nface was contorted in a grimace; his fists were clenched. Eragon rushed over, \\nfearing the worst.\\n“Help me hold \\nhim down. He’s going to hurt himself!” he cried to Murtagh, clasping Brom’s \\narms. His side burned sharply as the old man spasmed. Together they restrained \\nBrom until his convulsions ceased. Then they carefully returned him to the \\nledge.\\nEragon touched \\nBrom’s forehead. The skin was so hot that the heat could be felt an inch away. \\n“Get me water and a cloth,” he said worriedly. Murtagh brought them, and Eragon \\ngently bathed Brom’s face, trying to cool him down. With the cave quiet again, \\nhe noticed the sun shining outside.How long did we sleep? he asked \\nSaphira.\\nA good while. \\nI’ve been watching Brom for most of that time. He was fine until a minute ago \\nwhen he started thrashing. I woke you once he fell to the floor. \\nHe stretched, \\nwincing as his ribs twinged painfully. A hand suddenly gripped his shoulder. \\nBrom’s eyes snapped opened and fixed a glassy stare on Eragon. “You!” he \\ngasped. “Bring me the wineskin!”\\n“Brom?” \\nexclaimed Eragon, pleased to hear him talk. “You shouldn’t drink wine; it’ll \\nonly make you worse.”\\n“Bring it, \\nboy—just bring it . . . ,” sighed Brom. His hand slipped off Eragon’s shoulder.\\n“I’ll be right \\nback—hold on.” Eragon dashed to the saddlebags and rummaged through them \\nfrantically. “I can’t find it!” he cried, looking around desperately.\\n“Here, take \\nmine,” said Murtagh, holding out a leather skin.\\nEragon grabbed \\nit and returned to Brom. “I have the wine,” he said, kneeling. Murtagh \\nretreated to the cave’s mouth so they could have privacy.\\nBrom’s next \\nwords were faint and indistinct. “Good . . .” He moved his arm weakly. “Now . . \\n. wash my right hand with it.”\\n“What—” Eragon \\nstarted to ask.\\n“No questions! I \\nhaven’t time.” Mystified, Eragon unstoppered the wineskin and poured the liquid \\nonto Brom’s palm. He rubbed it into the old man’s skin, spreading it around the \\nfingers and over the back of the hand. “More,” croaked Brom. Eragon splashed \\nwine onto his hand again. He scrubbed vigorously as a brown dye floated off \\nBrom’s palm, then stopped, his mouth agape with amazement. There on Brom’s palm \\nwas the gedwëy ignasia.\\n“You’re a \\nRider?” he asked incredulously.\\nA painful smile \\nflickered on Brom’s face. “Once upon a time that was true . . . but no more. \\nWhen I was young . . . younger than you are now, I was chosen . . . chosen by \\nthe Riders to join their ranks. While they trained me, I became friends with another \\napprentice . . . Morzan, before he was a Forsworn.” Eragon gasped—that had been \\nover a hundred years ago. “But then he betrayed us to Galbatorix . . . and in \\nthe fighting at Dorú Areaba—Vroengard’s city—my young dragon was killed. Her \\nname . . . was Saphira.”\\n“Why didn’t you \\ntell me this before?” asked Eragon softly.\\nBrom laughed. \\n“Because . . . there was no need to.” He stopped. His breathing was labored; \\nhis hands were clenched. “I am old, Eragon . . . so old. Though my dragon was \\nkilled, my life has been longer than most. You don’t know what it is to reach \\nmy age, look back, and realize that you don’t remember much of it; then to look \\nforward and know that many years still lie ahead of you. . . . After all this \\ntime I still grieve for my Saphira . . . and hate Galbatorix for what he tore \\nfrom me.” His feverish eyes drilled into Eragon as he said fiercely, “Don’t let \\nthat happen to you. Don’t! Guard Saphira with your life, for without her it’s \\nhardly worth living.”\\n“You shouldn’t \\ntalk like this. Nothing’s going to happen to her,” said Eragon, worried.\\nBrom turned his \\nhead to the side. “Perhaps I am rambling.” His gaze passed blindly over \\nMurtagh, then he focused on Eragon. Brom’s voice grew stronger. “Eragon! I \\ncannot last much longer. This . . . this is a grievous wound; it saps my \\nstrength. I have not the energy to fight it. . . . Before I go, will you take \\nmy blessing?”\\n“Everything will \\nbe all right,” said Eragon, tears in his eyes. “You don’t have to do this.”\\n“It is the way \\nof things . . . I must. Will you take my blessing?” Eragon bowed his head and \\nnodded, overcome. Brom placed a trembling hand on his brow. “Then I give it to \\nyou. May the coming years bring you great happiness.” He motioned for Eragon to \\nbend closer. Very quietly, he whispered seven words from the ancient language, \\nthen even more softly told him what they meant. “That is all I can give you. . \\n. . Use them only in great need.”\\nBrom blindly \\nturned his eyes to the ceiling. “And now,” he murmured, “for the greatest \\nadventure of all. . . .”\\nWeeping, Eragon \\nheld his hand, comforting him as best he could. His vigil was unwavering and \\nsteadfast, unbroken by food or drink. As the long hours passed, a gray pallor \\ncrept over Brom, and his eyes slowly dimmed. His hands grew icy; the air around \\nhim took on an evil humor. Powerless to help, Eragon could only watch as the \\nRa’zac’s wound took its toll.\\nThe evening \\nhours were young and the shadows long when Brom suddenly stiffened. Eragon \\ncalled his name and cried for Murtagh’s help, but they could do nothing. As a \\nbarren silence dampened the air, Brom locked his eyes with Eragon’s. Then \\ncontentment spread across the old man’s face, and a whisper of breath escaped \\nhis lips. And so it was that Brom the storyteller died.\\n\\xa0\\nWith shaking \\nfingers, Eragon closed Brom’s eyes and stood. Saphira raised her head behind \\nhim and roared mournfully at the sky, keening her lamentation. Tears rolled \\ndown Eragon’s cheeks as a sense of horrible loss bled through him. Haltingly, \\nhe said, “We have to bury him.”\\n“We might be \\nseen,” warned Murtagh.\\n“I don’t care!”\\nMurtagh \\nhesitated, then bore Brom’s body out of the cave, along with his sword and \\nstaff. Saphira followed them. “To the top,” Eragon said thickly, indicating the \\ncrown of the sandstone hill.\\n“We can’t dig a \\ngrave out of stone,” objected Murtagh.\\n“I can do it.”\\nEragon climbed \\nonto the smooth hilltop, struggling because of his ribs. There, Murtagh lay \\nBrom on the stone.\\nEragon wiped his \\neyes and fixed his gaze on the sandstone. Gesturing with his hand, he said, \\n“Moi stenr!” The stone rippled. It flowed like water, forming a body-length \\ndepression in the hilltop. Molding the sandstone like wet clay, he raised \\nwaist-high walls around it.\\nThey laid Brom \\ninside the unfinished sandstone vault with his staff and sword. Stepping back, \\nEragon again shaped the stone with magic. It joined over Brom’s motionless face \\nand flowed upward into a tall faceted spire. As a final tribute, Eragon set \\nrunes into the stone:\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 35': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nHERELIESBROM\\nWho was a Dragon \\nRider\\nAnd like a \\nfather\\nTo me.\\nMay his name \\nlive on in glory.\\n\\xa0\\nThen he bowed \\nhis head and mourned freely. He stood like a living statue until evening, when \\nlight faded from the land.\\nThat night he \\ndreamed of the imprisoned woman again.\\nHe could tell \\nthat something was wrong with her. Her breathing was irregular, and she \\nshook—whether from cold or pain, he did not know. In the semidarkness of the \\ncell, the only thing clearly illuminated was her hand, which hung over the edge \\nof the cot. A dark liquid dripped from the tips of her fingers. Eragon knew it \\nwas blood.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 36': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nD IAMONDTOMB\\nWhen Eragon woke, \\nhis eyes were gritty, his body stiff. The cave was empty except for the horses. \\nThe litter was gone; no sign of Brom remained. He walked to the entrance and \\nsat on the pitted sandstone.So the witch Angela was correct—there was a \\ndeath in my future, he thought, staring bleakly at the land. The topaz sun \\nbrought a desert heat to the early morning.\\nA tear slid down \\nhis listless face and evaporated in the sunlight, leaving a salty crust on his \\nskin. He closed his eyes and absorbed the warmth, emptying his mind. With a \\nfingernail, he aimlessly scratched the sandstone. When he looked, he saw that \\nhe had writtenWhy me?\\nHe was still \\nthere when Murtagh climbed up to the cave, carrying a pair of rabbits. Without \\na word he seated himself by Eragon. “How are you?” he asked.\\n“Very ill.”\\nMurtagh \\nconsidered him thoughtfully. “Will you recover?” Eragon shrugged. After a few \\nminutes of reflection, Murtagh said, “I dislike asking this at such a time, but \\nI must know . . . Is your Bromthe Brom? The one who helped steal a \\ndragon egg from the king, chased it across the Empire, and killed Morzan in a \\nduel? I heard you say his name, and I read the inscription you put on his \\ngrave, but I must know for certain, Was that he?”\\n“It was,” said \\nEragon softly. A troubled expression settled on Murtagh’s face. “How do you \\nknow all that? You talk about things that are secret to most, and you were \\ntrailing the Ra’zac right when we needed help. Are you one of the Varden?”\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nbecame inscrutable orbs. “I’m running away, like you.” There was restrained \\nsorrow in his words. “I do not belong to either the Varden or the Empire. Nor \\ndo I owe allegiance to any man but myself. As for my rescuing you, I will admit \\nthat I’ve heard whispered tales of a new Rider and reasoned that by following \\nthe Ra’zac I might discover if they were true.”\\n“I thought you \\nwanted to kill the Ra’zac,” said Eragon.\\nMurtagh smiled \\ngrimly. “I do, but if I had, I never would have met you.”\\nBut Brom would \\nstill be alive. . . . I wish he were here. He would know whether to trust \\nMurtagh.Eragon \\nremembered how Brom had sensed Trevor’s intentions in Daret and wondered if he \\ncould do the same with Murtagh. He reached for Murtagh’s consciousness, but his \\nprobe abruptly ran into an iron-hard wall, which he tried to circumvent. \\nMurtagh’s entire mind was fortified.How did he learn to do that? Brom said \\nthat few people, if any, could keep others out of their mind without training. \\nSo who is Murtagh to have this ability ? Pensive and lonely, Eragon asked, \\n“Where is Saphira?”\\n“I don’t know,” \\nsaid Murtagh. “She followed me for a time when I went hunting, then flew off on \\nher own. I haven’t seen her since before noon.” Eragon rocked onto his feet and \\nreturned to the cave. Murtagh followed. “What are you going to do now?”\\n“I’m not sure.”And \\nI don’t want to think about it either. He rolled up his blankets and tied \\nthem to Cadoc’s saddlebags. His ribs hurt. Murtagh went to prepare the rabbits. \\nAs Eragon shifted things in his bags, he uncovered Zar’roc. The red sheath \\nglinted brightly. He took out the sword . . . weighed it in his hands.\\nHe had never \\ncarried Zar’roc nor used it in combat—except when he and Brom had \\nsparred—because he had not wanted people to see it. That concerned Eragon no \\nmore. The Ra’zac had seemed surprised and frightened by the sword; that was \\nmore than enough reason for him to wear it. With a shudder he pulled off his \\nbow and belted on Zar’roc.From this moment on, I’ll live by the sword. Let \\nthe whole world see what I am. I have no fear. I am a Rider now, fully and \\ncompletely.\\nHe sorted \\nthrough Brom’s bags but found only clothes, a few odd items, and a small pouch \\nof coins. Eragon took the map of Alagaësia and put the bags away, then crouched \\nby the fire. Murtagh’s eyes narrowed as he looked up from the rabbit he was \\nskinning. “That sword. May I see it?” he asked, wiping his hands.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, reluctant to relinquish the weapon for even a moment, then nodded. \\nMurtagh examined the symbol on the blade intently. His face darkened. “Where \\ndid you get this?”\\n“Brom gave it to \\nme. Why?”\\nMurtagh shoved \\nthe sword back and crossed his arms angrily. He was breathing hard. “That \\nsword,” he said with emotion, “was once as well known as its owner. The last \\nRider to carry it was Morzan—a brutal, savage man. I thought you were a foe of \\nthe Empire, yet here I find you bearing one of the Forsworn’s bloody swords!”\\nEragon stared at \\nZar’roc with shock. He realized that Brom must have taken it from Morzan after \\nthey fought in Gil’ead. “Brom never told me where it came from,” he said \\ntruthfully. “I had no idea it was Morzan’s.”\\n“He never told \\nyou?” asked Murtagh, a note of disbelief in his voice. Eragon shook his head. \\n“That’s strange. I can think of no reason for him to have concealed it.”\\n“Neither can I. \\nBut then, he kept many secrets,” said Eragon. It felt unsettling to hold the \\nsword of the man who had betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix.This blade \\nprobably killed many Riders in its time, he thought with revulsion.And \\nworse, dragons! “Even so, I’m going to carry it. I don’t have a sword of my \\nown. Until such time as I get one, I’ll use Zar’roc.”\\nMurtagh flinched \\nas Eragon said the name. “It’s your choice,” he said. He returned to skinning, \\nkeeping his gaze focused downward.\\nWhen the meal \\nwas ready, Eragon ate slowly, though he was quite hungry. The hot food made him \\nfeel better. As they scraped out their bowls, he said, “I have to sell my \\nhorse.”\\n“Why not \\nBrom’s?” asked Murtagh. He seemed to have gotten over his bad temper.\\n“Snowfire? \\nBecause Brom promised to take care of him. Since he . . . isn’t around, I’ll do \\nit for him.”\\nMurtagh set his \\nbowl on his lap. “If that’s what you want, I’m sure we can find a buyer in some \\ntown or village.”\\n“We?” asked \\nEragon.\\nMurtagh looked \\nat him sideways in a calculating way. “You won’t want to stay here for much \\nlonger. If the Ra’zac are nearby, Brom’s tomb will be like a beacon for them.” \\nEragon had not thought of that. “And your ribs are going to take time to heal. \\nI know you can defend yourself with magic, but you need a companion who can \\nlift things and use a sword. I’m asking to travel with you, at least for the \\ntime being. But I must warn you, the Empire is searching for me. There’ll be \\nblood over it eventually.”\\nEragon laughed \\nweakly and found himself crying because it hurt so much. Once his breath was \\nback, he said, “I don’t care if the entire army is searching for you. You’re \\nright. I do need help. I would be glad to have you along, though I have to talk \\nto Saphira about it. But I have to warnyou, Galbatorix justmight \\nsend the entire army after me. You won’t be any safer with Saphira and me than \\nif you were on your own.”\\n“I know that,” \\nsaid Murtagh with a quick grin. “But all the same, it won’t stop me.”\\n“Good.” Eragon \\nsmiled with gratitude.\\nWhile they \\nspoke, Saphira crawled into the cave and greeted Eragon. She was glad to see \\nhim, but there was deep sadness in her thoughts and words. She laid her big \\nblue head on the floor and asked,Are you well again?\\nNot quite. \\nI miss the old \\none.\\n\\nAs do I . . . I \\nnever suspected that he was a Rider. Brom! He really was an old man—as old as \\nthe Forsworn. Everything he taught me about magic he must have learned from the \\nRiders themselves.\\n\\nSaphira shifted \\nslightly.I knew what he was the moment he touched me at your farm.\\nAnd you didn’t \\ntell me? Why?\\n\\nHe asked me not \\nto, she \\nsaid simply.\\nEragon decided \\nnot to make an issue of it. Saphira never meant to hurt him. Brom kept more \\nthan that secret,he told her, then explained about Zar’roc and Murtagh’s \\nreaction to it.I understand now why Brom didn’t explain Zar’roc’s origins \\nwhen he gave it to me. If he had, I probably would have run away from him at \\nthe first opportunity.\\nYou would do \\nwell to rid yourself of that sword,she said with distaste.I know it’s a \\npeerless weapon, but you would be better off with a normal blade rather than \\nMorzan’s butchery tool.\\nPerhaps. \\nSaphira, where does our path go from here? Murtagh offered to come with us. I \\ndon’t know his past, but he seems honest enough. Should we go to the Varden \\nnow? Only I don’t know how to find them. Brom never told us. \\nHe told me,said Saphira.\\nEragon grew \\nangry.Why did he trust you, but not me, with all this knowledge?\\nHer scales \\nrustled over the dry rock as she stood above him, eyes profound.After we \\nleft Teirm and were attacked by the Urgals, he told me many things, some of \\nwhich I will not speak of unless necessary. He was concerned about his own \\ndeath and what would happen to you after it. One fact he imparted to me was the \\nname of a man, Dormnad, who lives in Gil’ead. He can help us find the Varden. \\nBrom also wanted you to know that of all the people in Alagaësia, he believed \\nyou were the best suited to inherit the Riders’ legacy.\\nTears welled in \\nEragon’s eyes. This was the highest praise he could have ever received from \\nBrom.A responsibility I will bear honorably.\\nGood. \\nWe will go to \\nGil’ead, then,stated \\nEragon, strength and purpose returning to him.And what of Murtagh? Do you \\nthink he should come with us?\\nWe owe him our \\nlives,said \\nSaphira.But even if that weren’t so, he has seen both you and me. We should \\nkeep him close so he doesn’t furnish the Empire with our location and descriptions, \\nwillingly or not.\\nHe agreed with \\nher, then told Saphira about his dream.What I saw disturbed me. I feel that \\ntime is running out for her; something dreadful is going to happen soon. She’s \\nin mortal danger—I’m sure of it—but I don’t know how to find her! She could be \\nanywhere.\\nWhat does your \\nheart say?asked \\nSaphira.\\nMy heart died a \\nwhile back,said \\nEragon with a hint of black humor.However, I think we should go north to \\nGil’ead. With any luck, one of the towns or cities along our path is where this \\nwoman is being held. I’m afraid that my next dream of her will show a grave. I \\ncouldn’t stand that.\\nWhy? \\nI’m not sure,he said, \\nshrugging.It’s just that when I see her, I feel as if she’s precious and \\nshouldn’t be lost. . . . It’s very strange. Saphira opened her long mouth \\nand laughed silently, fangs gleaming.What is it? snapped Eragon. She \\nshook her head and quietly padded away.\\nEragon grumbled \\nto himself, then told Murtagh what they had decided. Murtagh said, “If you find \\nthis Dormnad and then continue on to the Varden, I will leave you. Encountering \\nthe Varden would be as dangerous for me as walking unarmed into Urû’baen with a \\nfanfare of trumpets to announce my arrival.”\\n“We won’t have \\nto part anytime soon,” said Eragon. “It’s a long way to Gil’ead.” His voice \\ncracked slightly, and he squinted at the sun to distract himself. “We should \\nleave before the day grows any older.”\\n“Are you strong \\nenough to travel?” asked Murtagh, frowning.\\n“I have to do \\nsomething or I’ll go crazy,” said Eragon brusquely. “Sparring, practicing \\nmagic, or sitting around twiddling my thumbs aren’t good options right now, so \\nI choose to ride.”\\nThey doused the \\nfire, packed, and led the horses out of the cave. Eragon handed Cadoc’s and \\nSnowfire’s reins to Murtagh, saying, “Go on, I’ll be right down.” Murtagh began \\nthe slow descent from the cave.\\nEragon struggled \\nup the sandstone, resting when his side made it impossible to breathe. When he \\nreached the top, he found Saphira already there. They stood together before \\nBrom’s grave and paid their last respects.I can’t believe he’s gone . . . \\nforever. As Eragon turned to depart, Saphira snaked out her long neck to \\ntouch the tomb with the tip of her nose. Her sides vibrated as a low humming \\nfilled the air.\\nThe sandstone \\naround her nose shimmered like gilded dew, turning clear with dancing silver \\nhighlights. Eragon watched in wonder as tendrils of white diamond twisted over \\nthe tomb’s surface in a web of priceless filigree. Sparkling shadows were cast \\non the ground, reflecting splashes of brilliant colors that shifted dazzlingly \\nas the sandstone continued to change. With a satisfied snort, Saphira stepped \\nback and examined her handiwork.\\nThe sculpted \\nsandstone mausoleum of moments before had transformed into a sparkling gemstone \\nvault—under which Brom’s untouched face was visible. Eragon gazed with yearning \\nat the old man, who seemed to be only sleeping. “What did you do?” he asked \\nSaphira with awe.\\nI gave him the \\nonly gift I could. Now time will not ravage him. He can rest in peace for \\neternity.\\n\\nThank you.Eragon put a \\nhand on her side, and they left together.\\nC APTURE \\nATGIL’EAD\\nRiding was \\nextremely painful for Eragon—his broken ribs prevented them from going faster \\nthan a walk, and it was impossible for him to breathe deeply without a burst of \\nagony. Nevertheless, he refused to stop. Saphira flew close by, her mind linked \\nwith his for solace and strength.\\nMurtagh rode \\nconfidently beside Cadoc, flowing smoothly with his horse’s movements. Eragon \\nwatched the gray animal for a while. “You have a beautiful horse. What’s his \\nname?”\\n“Tornac, after \\nthe man who taught me how to fight.” Murtagh patted the horse’s side. “He was \\ngiven to me when he was just a foal. You’d be hard pressed to find a more \\ncourageous and intelligent animal in all of Alagaësia, Saphira excepted, of \\ncourse.”\\n“He is a \\nmagnificent beast,” said Eragon admiringly.\\nMurtagh laughed. \\n“Yes, but Snowfire is as close to his match as I’ve ever seen.”\\nThey covered \\nonly a short distance that day, yet Eragon was glad to be on the move again. It \\nkept his mind off other, more morbid matters. They were riding through \\nunsettled land. The road to Dras-Leona was several leagues to their left. They \\nwould skirt the city by a wide margin on the way to Gil’ead, which was almost \\nas far to the north as Carvahall.\\n\\xa0\\nThey sold Cadoc \\nin a small village. As the horse was led away by his new owner, Eragon \\nregretfully pocketed the few coins he had gained from the transaction. It was \\ndifficult to relinquish Cadoc after crossing half of Alagaësia—and outracing \\nUrgals—on him.\\nThe days rolled \\nby unnoticed as their small group traveled in isolation. Eragon was pleased to \\nfind that he and Murtagh shared many of the same interests; they spent hours \\ndebating the finer points of archery and hunting.\\nThere was one \\nsubject, however, they avoided discussing by unspoken consent: their pasts. \\nEragon did not explain how he had found Saphira, met Brom, or where he came \\nfrom. Murtagh was likewise mute as to why the Empire was chasing him. It was a \\nsimple arrangement, but it worked.\\nYet because of \\ntheir proximity, it was inevitable that they learned about each other. Eragon \\nwas intrigued by Murtagh’s familiarity with the power struggles and politics \\nwithin the Empire. He seemed to know what every noble and courtier was doing \\nand how it affected everyone else. Eragon listened carefully, suspicions \\nwhirling through his mind.\\nThe first week \\nwent by without any sign of the Ra’zac, which allayed some of Eragon’s fears. \\nEven so, they still kept watches at night. Eragon had expected to encounter \\nUrgals on the way to Gil’ead, but they found no trace of them.I thought \\nthese remote places would be teeming with monsters, he mused.Still, I’m \\nnot one to complain if they’ve gone elsewhere.\\nHe dreamed of \\nthe woman no more. And though he tried to scry her, he saw only an empty cell. \\nWhenever they passed a town or city, he checked to see if it had a jail. If it \\ndid, he would disguise himself and visit it, but she was not to be found. His \\ndisguises became increasingly elaborate as he saw notices featuring his name \\nand description—and offering a substantial reward for his capture—posted in \\nvarious towns.\\nTheir travels \\nnorth forced them toward the capital, Urû’baen. It was a heavily populated \\narea, which made it difficult to escape notice. Soldiers patrolled the roads \\nand guarded the bridges. It took them several tense, irritable days to skirt \\nthe capital.\\nOnce they were \\nsafely past Urû’baen, they found themselves on the edge of a vast plain. It was \\nthe same one that Eragon had crossed after leaving Palancar Valley, except now \\nhe was on the opposite side. They kept to the perimeter of the plain and \\ncontinued north, following the Ramr River.\\nEragon’s \\nsixteenth birthday came and went during this time. At Carvahall a celebration \\nwould have been held for his entrance into manhood, but in the wilderness he \\ndid not even mention it to Murtagh.\\nAt nearly six \\nmonths of age, Saphira was much larger. Her wings were massive; every inch of \\nthem was needed to lift her muscular body and thick bones. The fangs that \\njutted from her jaw were nearly as thick around as Eragon’s fist, their points \\nas sharp as Zar’roc.\\n\\xa0\\nThe day finally \\ncame when Eragon unwrapped his side for the last time. His ribs had healed \\ncompletely, leaving him with only a small scar where the Ra’zac’s boot had cut \\nhis side. As Saphira watched, he stretched slowly, then with increasing vigor \\nwhen there was no pain. He flexed his muscles, pleased. In an earlier time he \\nwould have smiled, but after Brom’s death, such expressions did not come \\neasily.\\nHe tugged his \\ntunic on and walked back to the small fire they had made. Murtagh sat next to \\nit, whittling a piece of wood. Eragon drew Zar’roc. Murtagh tensed, though his \\nface remained calm. “Now that I am strong enough, would you like to spar?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nMurtagh tossed \\nthe wood to the side. “With sharpened swords? We could kill each other.”\\n“Here, give me \\nyour sword,” said Eragon. Murtagh hesitated, then handed over his long \\nhand-and-a-half sword. Eragon blocked the edges with magic, the way Brom had \\ntaught him. While Murtagh examined the blade, Eragon said, “I can undo that \\nonce we’re finished.”\\nMurtagh checked \\nthe balance of his sword. Satisfied, he said, “It will do.” Eragon safed \\nZar’roc, settled into a crouch, then swung at Murtagh’s shoulder. Their swords \\nmet in midair. Eragon disengaged with a flourish, thrust, and then riposted as \\nMurtagh parried, dancing away.\\nHe’s fast!thought Eragon.\\nThey struggled \\nback and forth, trying to batter each other down. After a particularly intense \\nseries of blows, Murtagh started laughing. Not only was it impossible for \\neither of them to gain an advantage, but they were so evenly matched that they \\ntired at the same rate. Acknowledging with grins each other’s skill, they \\nfought on until their arms were leaden and sweat poured off their sides.\\nFinally Eragon \\ncalled, “Enough, halt!” Murtagh stopped in mid-blow and sat down with a gasp. \\nEragon staggered to the ground, his chest heaving. None of his fights with Brom \\nhad been this fierce.\\nAs he gulped air, \\nMurtagh exclaimed, “You’re amazing! I’ve studied swordplay all my life, but \\nnever have I fought one like you. You could be the king’s weapon master if you \\nwanted to.”\\n“You’re just as \\ngood,” observed Eragon, still panting. “The man who taught you, Tornac, could \\nmake a fortune with a fencing school. People would come from all parts of \\nAlagaësia to learn from him.”\\n“He’s dead,” \\nsaid Murtagh shortly.\\n“I’m sorry.”\\nThus it became \\ntheir custom to fight in the evening, which kept them lean and fit, like a pair \\nof matched blades. With his return to health, Eragon also resumed practicing \\nmagic. Murtagh was curious about it and soon revealed that he knew a surprising \\namount about how it worked, though he lacked the precise details and could not \\nuse it himself. Whenever Eragon practiced speaking in the ancient language, \\nMurtagh would listen quietly, occasionally asking what a word meant.\\n\\xa0\\nOn the outskirts \\nof Gil’ead they stopped the horses side by side. It had taken them nearly a \\nmonth to reach it, during which time spring had finally nudged away the \\nremnants of winter. Eragon had felt himself changing during the trip, growing \\nstronger and calmer. He still thought about Brom and spoke about him with \\nSaphira, but for the most part he tried not to awaken painful memories.\\nFrom a distance \\nthey could see the city was a rough, barbaric place, filled with log houses and \\nyapping dogs. There was a rambling stone fortress at its center. The air was \\nhazy with blue smoke. The place seemed more like a temporary trading post than \\na permanent city. Five miles beyond it was the hazy outline of Isenstar Lake.\\nThey decided to \\ncamp two miles from the city, for safety. While their dinner simmered, Murtagh \\nsaid, “I’m not sure you should be the one to go into Gil’ead.”\\n“Why? I can \\ndisguise myself well enough,” said Eragon. “And Dormnad will want to see the \\ngedwëy ignasia as proof that I really am a Rider.”\\n“Perhaps,” said \\nMurtagh, “but the Empire wants you much more than me. If I’m captured, I could \\neventually escape. But ifyou are taken, they’ll drag you to the king, \\nwhere you’ll be in for a slow death by torture—unless you join him. Plus, \\nGil’ead is one of the army’s major staging points. Those aren’t houses out \\nthere; they’re barracks. Going in there would be like handing yourself to the \\nking on a gilded platter.”\\nEragon asked \\nSaphira for her opinion. She wrapped her tail around his legs and lay next to \\nhim.You shouldn’t have to ask me; he speaks sense. There are certain words I \\ncan give him that will convince Dormnad of his truthfulness. And Murtagh’s \\nright; if anyone is to risk capture it should be him, because he would live \\nthrough it.\\nHe grimaced.I \\ndon’t like letting him put himself in danger for us. “All right, you can \\ngo,” he said reluctantly. “But if anything goes wrong, I’m coming after you.”\\nMurtagh laughed. \\n“That would be fit for a legend: how a lone Rider took on the king’s army \\nsingle-handedly.” He chuckled again and stood. “Is there anything I should know \\nbefore going?”\\n“Shouldn’t we \\nrest and wait until tomorrow?” asked Eragon cautiously.\\n“Why? The longer \\nwe stay here, the greater the chance that we’ll be discovered. If this Dormnad \\ncan take you to the Varden, then he needs to be found as quickly as possible. \\nNeither of us should remain near Gil’ead longer than a few days.”\\nAgain wisdom \\nflies from his mouth,commented \\nSaphira dryly. She told Eragon what should be said to Dormnad, and he relayed \\nthe information to Murtagh.\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Murtagh, adjusting his sword. “Unless there’s trouble, I’ll be back within \\na couple of hours. Make sure there’s some food left for me.” With a wave of his \\nhand, he jumped onto Tornac and rode away. Eragon sat by the fire, tapping \\nZar’roc’s pommel apprehensively.\\nHours passed, \\nbut Murtagh did not return. Eragon paced around the fire, Zar’roc in hand, \\nwhile Saphira watched Gil’ead attentively. Only her eyes moved. Neither of them \\nvoiced their worries, though Eragon unobtrusively prepared to leave—in case a \\ndetachment of soldiers left the city and headed toward their camp.\\nLook,snapped Saphira.\\nEragon swiveled \\ntoward Gil’ead, alert. He saw a distant horseman exit the city and ride \\nfuriously toward their camp.I don’t like this, he said as he climbed \\nonto Saphira.Be ready to fly.\\nI’m prepared for \\nmore than that.\\n\\nAs the rider \\napproached, Eragon recognized Murtagh bent low over Tornac. No one seemed to be \\npursuing him, but he did not slow his reckless pace. He galloped into the camp \\nand jumped to the ground, drawing his sword. “What’s wrong?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh scowled. \\n“Did anyone follow me from Gil’ead?”\\n“We didn’t see \\nanyone.”\\n“Good. Then let \\nme eat before I explain. I’m starving.” He seized a bowl and began eating with \\ngusto. After a few sloppy bites, he said through a full mouth, “Dormnad has \\nagreed to meet us outside Gil’ead at sunrise tomorrow. If he’s satisfied you \\nreally are a Rider and that it’s not a trap, he’ll take you to the Varden.”\\n“Where are we \\nsupposed to meet him?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh pointed \\nwest. “On a small hill across the road.”\\n“So what happened?”\\nMurtagh spooned \\nmore food into his bowl. “It’s a rather simple thing, but all the more deadly \\nbecause of it: I was seen in the street by someone who knows me. I did the only \\nthing I could and ran away. It was too late, though; he recognized me.”\\nIt was \\nunfortunate, but Eragon was unsure how bad it really was. “Since I don’t know \\nyour friend, I have to ask: Will he tell anyone?”\\nMurtagh gave a \\nstrained laugh. “If youhad met him, that wouldn’t need answering. His \\nmouth is loosely hinged and hangs open all the time, vomiting whatever happens \\nto be in his mind. The question isn’twhether he will tell people, butwhom \\nhe will tell. If word of this reaches the wrong ears, we’ll be in trouble.”\\n“I doubt that \\nsoldiers will be sent to search for you in the dark,” Eragon pointed out. “We \\ncan at least count on being safe until morning, and by then, if all goes well, \\nwe’ll be leaving with Dormnad.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head. “No, only you will accompany him. As I said before, I won’t go to the \\nVarden.”\\nEragon stared at \\nhim unhappily. He wanted Murtagh to stay. They had become friends during their \\ntravels, and he was loath to tear that apart. He started to protest, but \\nSaphira hushed him and said gently,Wait until tomorrow. Now is not the time.\\nVery well,he said glumly. \\nThey talked until the stars were bright in the sky, then slept as Saphira took \\nthe first watch.\\nEragon woke two \\nhours before dawn, his palm tingling. Everything was still and quiet, but \\nsomething sought his attention, like an itch in his mind. He buckled on Zar’roc \\nand stood, careful not to make a sound. Saphira looked at him curiously, her \\nlarge eyes bright.What is it? she asked.\\nI don’t know,said Eragon. He \\nsaw nothing amiss.\\nSaphira sniffed \\nthe air curiously. She hissed a little and lifted her head. I smell horses \\nnearby, but they’re not moving. They reek with an unfamiliar stench.\\nEragon crept to \\nMurtagh and shook his shoulder. Murtagh woke with a start, yanked a dagger from \\nunder his blankets, then looked at Eragon quizzically. Eragon motioned for him \\nto be silent, whispering, “There are horses close by.”\\nMurtagh \\nwordlessly drew his sword. They quietly stationed themselves on either side of \\nSaphira, prepared for an attack. As they waited, the morning star rose in the \\neast. A squirrel chattered.\\nThen an angry \\nsnarl from behind made Eragon spin around, sword held high. A broad Urgal stood \\nat the edge of the camp, carrying a mattock with a nasty spike.Where did he \\ncome from? We haven’t seen their tracks anywhere! thought Eragon. The Urgal \\nroared and waved his weapon, but did not charge.\\n“Brisingr!” \\nbarked Eragon, stabbing out with magic. The Urgal’s face contorted with terror \\nas he exploded in a flash of blue light. Blood splattered Eragon, and a brown \\nmass flew through the air. Behind him, Saphira bugled with alarm and reared. \\nEragon twisted around. While he had been occupied with the first Urgal, a group \\nof them had run up from the side.Of all the stupid tricks to fall for!\\nSteel clashed \\nloudly as Murtagh attacked the Urgals. Eragon tried to join him but was blocked \\nby four of the monsters. The first one swung a sword at his shoulder. He ducked \\nthe blow and killed the Urgal with magic. He caught a second one in the throat \\nwith Zar’roc, wheeled wildly, and slashed a third through the heart. As he did, \\nthe fourth Urgal rushed at him, swinging a heavy club.\\nEragon saw him \\ncoming and tried to lift his sword to block the club, but was a second too \\nslow. As the club came down on his head, he screamed, “Fly, Saphira!” A burst \\nof light filled his eyes and he lost consciousness.\\nD USÚNDAVARFREOHR\\nThe first things \\nEragon noticed were that he was warm and dry, his cheek was pressed against \\nrough fabric, and his hands were unbound. He stirred, but it was minutes before \\nhe was able to push himself upright and examine his surroundings.\\nHe was sitting \\nin a cell on a narrow, bumpy cot. A barred window was set high in the wall. The \\niron-bound door with a small window in its top half, barred like the one in the \\nwall, was shut securely.\\nDried blood \\ncracked on Eragon’s face when he moved. It took him a moment to remember that \\nit was not his. His head hurt horribly—which was to be expected, considering \\nthe blow he had taken—and his mind was strangely fuzzy. He tried to use magic, \\nbut could not concentrate well enough to remember any of the ancient words.They \\nmust have drugged me, he finally decided.\\nWith a groan he \\ngot up, missing the familiar weight of Zar’roc on his hip, and lurched to the \\nwindow in the wall. He managed to see out of it by standing on his toes. It \\ntook a minute for his eyes to adjust to the bright light outside. The window \\nwas level with the ground. A street full of busy people ran past the side of \\nhis cell, beyond which were rows of identical log houses.\\nFeeling weak, \\nEragon slid to the floor and stared at it blankly. What he had seen outside \\ndisturbed him, but he was unsure why. Cursing his sluggish thinking, he leaned \\nback his head and tried to clear his mind. A man entered the room and set a \\ntray of food and a pitcher of water on the cot.Wasn’t that nice of him? \\nthought Eragon, smiling pleasantly. He took a couple of bites of the thin \\ncabbage soup and stale bread, but was barely able to stomach it.I wish he \\nhad brought me something better, he complained, dropping the spoon.\\nHe suddenly \\nrealized what was wrong.I was captured by Urgals, not men! How did I end up \\nhere? His befuddled brain grappled with the paradox unsuccessfully. With a \\nmental shrug he filed the discovery away for a time when he would know what to \\ndo with it.\\nHe sat on the \\ncot and gazed into the distance. Hours later more food was brought in.And I \\nwas just getting hungry, he thought thickly. This time he was able to eat \\nwithout feeling sick. When he finished, he decided it was time for a nap. After \\nall, he was on a bed; what else was he going to do?\\nHis mind drifted \\noff; sleep began to envelop him. Then a gate clanged open somewhere, and the \\ndin of steel-shod boots marching on a stone floor filled the air. The noise \\ngrew louder and louder until it sounded like someone banging a pot inside \\nEragon’s head. He grumbled to himself.Can’t they let me rest in peace? \\nFuzzy curiosity slowly overcame his exhaustion, so he dragged himself to the \\ndoor, blinking like an owl.\\nThrough the \\nwindow he saw a wide hallway nearly ten yards across. The opposing wall was \\nlined with cells similar to his own. A column of soldiers marched through the \\nhall, their swords drawn and ready. Every man was dressed in matching armor; \\ntheir faces bore the same hard expression, and their feet came down on the \\nfloor with mechanical precision, never missing a beat. The sound was hypnotic. \\nIt was an impressive display of force.\\nEragon watched \\nthe soldiers until he grew bored. Just then he noticed a break in the middle of \\nthe column. Carried between two burly men was an unconscious woman.\\nHer long \\nmidnight-black hair obscured her face, despite a leather strip bound around her \\nhead to hold the tresses back. She was dressed in dark leather pants and shirt. \\nWrapped around her slim waist was a shiny belt, from which hung an empty sheath \\non her right hip. Knee-high boots covered her calves and small feet.\\nHer head lolled \\nto the side. Eragon gasped, feeling like he had been struck in the stomach. She \\nwas the woman from his dreams. Her sculpted face was as perfect as a painting. \\nHer round chin, high cheekbones, and long eyelashes gave her an exotic look. \\nThe only mar in her beauty was a scrape along her jaw; nevertheless, she was \\nthe fairest woman he had ever seen.\\nEragon’s blood \\nburned as he looked at her. Something awoke in him—something he had never felt \\nbefore. It was like an obsession, except stronger, almost a fevered madness. \\nThen the woman’s hair shifted, revealing pointed ears. A chill crept over him. \\nShe was an elf.\\nThe soldiers \\ncontinued marching, taking her from his sight. Next strode a tall, proud man, a \\nsable cape billowing behind him. His face was deathly white; his hair was red. \\nRed like blood.\\nAs he walked by \\nEragon’s cell, the man turned his head and looked squarely at him with maroon \\neyes. His upper lip pulled back in a feral smile, revealing teeth filed to \\npoints. Eragon shrank back. He knew what the man was.A Shade.So help me . . \\n. a Shade. The procession continued, and the Shade vanished from view.\\nEragon sank to \\nthe floor, hugging himself. Even in his bewildered state, he knew that the \\npresence of a Shade meant that evil was loose in the land. Whenever they \\nappeared, rivers of blood were sure to follow.What is a Shade doing here? \\nThe soldiers should have killed him on sight! Then his thoughts returned to \\nthe elf-woman, and he was grasped by strange emotions again.\\nI have to \\nescape.But \\nwith his mind clouded, his determination quickly faded. He returned to the cot. \\nBy the time the hallway fell silent, he was fast asleep.\\n\\xa0\\nAs soon as \\nEragon opened his eyes, he knew something was different. It was easier for him \\nto think; he realized that he was in Gil’ead.They made a mistake; the drug’s \\nwearing off! Hopeful, he tried to contact Saphira and use magic, but both \\nactivities were still beyond his reach. A pit of worry twisted inside him as he \\nwondered if she and Murtagh had managed to escape. He stretched his arms and \\nlooked out the window. The city was just awakening; the street was empty except \\nfor two beggars.\\nHe reached for \\nthe water pitcher, ruminating about the elf and Shade. As he started to drink, \\nhe noticed that the water had a faint odor, as if it contained a few drops of \\nrancid perfume. Grimacing, he set the pitcher down.The drug must be in there \\nand maybe in the food as well! He remembered that when the Ra’zac had \\ndrugged him, it had taken hours to wear off.If I can keep from drinking and \\neating for long enough, I should be able to use magic. Then I can rescue the \\nelf. . . . The thought made him smile. He sat in a corner, dreaming about \\nhow it could be done.\\nThe portly \\njailer entered the cell an hour later with a tray of food. Eragon waited until \\nhe departed, then carried the tray to the window. The meal was composed only of \\nbread, cheese, and an onion, but the smell made his stomach grumble hungrily. Resigning \\nhimself to a miserable day, he shoved the food out the window and onto the \\nstreet, hoping that no one would notice.\\nEragon devoted \\nhimself to overcoming the drug’s effects. He had difficulty concentrating for \\nany length of time, but as the day progressed, his mental acuity increased. He \\nbegan to remember several of the ancient words, though nothing happened when he \\nuttered them. He wanted to scream with frustration.\\nWhen lunch was \\ndelivered, he pushed it out the window after his breakfast. His hunger was \\ndistracting, but it was the lack of water that taxed him most. The back of his \\nthroat was parched. Thoughts of drinking cool water tortured him as each breath \\ndried his mouth and throat a bit more. Even so, he forced himself to ignore the \\npitcher.\\nHe was diverted \\nfrom his discomfort by a commotion in the hall. A man argued in a loud voice, \\n“You can’t go in there! The orders were clear: no one is to see him!”\\n“Really? Will \\nyou be the one to die stopping me, Captain?” cut in a smooth voice.\\nThere was a \\nsubdued, “No . . . but the king—”\\n“Iwill \\nhandle the king,” interrupted the second person. “Now, unlock the door.”\\nAfter a pause, \\nkeys jangled outside Eragon’s cell. He tried to adopt a languorous expression.I \\nhave to act like I don’t understand what’s going on. I can’t show surprise, no \\nmatter what this person says.\\nThe door opened. \\nHis breath caught as he looked into the Shade’s face. It was like gazing at a \\ndeath mask or a polished skull with skin pulled over it to give the appearance \\nof life. “Greetings,” said the Shade with a cold smile, showing his filed \\nteeth. “I’ve waited a long time to meet you.”\\n“Who—who’re \\nyou?” asked Eragon, slurring his words.\\n“No one of \\nconsequence,” answered the Shade, his maroon eyes alight with controlled \\nmenace. He sat with a flourish of his cloak. “My name does not matter to one in \\nyour position. It wouldn’t mean a thing to you anyway. It’s you that I’m \\ninterested in. Who are you?”\\nThe question was \\nposed innocently enough, but Eragon knew there had to be a catch or trap in it, \\nthough it eluded him. He pretended to struggle over the question for a while, \\nthen slowly said, frowning, “I’m not sure. . . . M’name’s Eragon, but that’s \\nnot all I am, is it?”\\nThe Shade’s \\nnarrow lips stretched tautly over his mouth as he laughed sharply. “No, it \\nisn’t. You have an interesting mind, my young Rider.” He leaned forward. The \\nskin on his forehead was thin and translucent. “It seems I must be more direct. \\nWhat is your name?”\\n“Era—”\\n“No! Not that \\none.” The Shade cut him off with a wave of his hand. “Don’t you have another \\none, one that you use only rarely?”\\nHe wants my true \\nname so he can control me!realized Eragon.But I can’t tell him. I don’t \\neven know it myself. He thought quickly, trying to invent a deception that \\nwould conceal his ignorance.What if I made up a name? He hesitated—it \\ncould easily give him away—then raced to create a name that would withstand \\nscrutiny. As he was about to utter it, he decided to take a chance and try to scare \\nthe Shade. He deftly switched a few letters, then nodded foolishly and said, \\n“Brom told it to me once. It was . . .” The pause stretched for a few seconds, \\nthen his face brightened as he appeared to remember. “It was Du Súndavar \\nFreohr.” Which meant almost literally “death of the shadows.”\\nA grim chill \\nsettled over the cell as the Shade sat motionless, eyes veiled. He seemed to be \\ndeep in thought, pondering what he had learned. Eragon wondered if he had dared \\ntoo much. He waited until the Shade stirred before asking ingenuously, “Why are \\nyou here?”\\nThe Shade looked \\nat him with contempt in his red eyes and smiled. “To gloat, of course. What use \\nis a victory if one cannot enjoy it?” There was confidence in his voice, but he \\nseemed uneasy, as if his plans had been disrupted. He stood suddenly. “I must \\nattend to certain matters, but while I am gone you would do well to think on \\nwho you would rather serve: a Rider who betrayed your own order or a fellow man \\nlike me, though one skilled in arcane arts. When the time comes to choose, \\nthere will be no middle ground.” He turned to leave, then glanced at Eragon’s \\nwater pitcher and stopped, his face granite hard. “Captain!” he snapped.\\nA \\nbroad-shouldered man rushed into the cell, sword in hand. “What is it, my \\nlord?” he asked, alarmed.\\n“Put that toy \\naway,” instructed the Shade. He turned to Eragon and said in a deadly quiet \\nvoice, “The boy hasn’t been drinking his water. Why is that?”\\n“I talked with \\nthe jailer earlier. Every bowl and plate was scraped clean.”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid the Shade, mollified. “But make sure that he starts drinking again.” He \\nleaned toward the captain and murmured into his ear. Eragon caught the last few \\nwords, “. . . extra dose, just in case.” The captain nodded. The Shade returned \\nhis attention to Eragon. “We will talk again tomorrow when I am not so pressed \\nfor time. You should know, I have an endless fascination for names. I will \\ngreatly enjoy discussing yours inmuch greater detail.”\\nThe way he said \\nit gave Eragon a sinking feeling.\\nOnce they left, \\nhe lay on the cot and closed his eyes. Brom’s lessons proved their worth now; \\nhe relied on them to keep himself from panicking and to reassure himself.Everything \\nhas been provided for me; I only have to take advantage of it. His thoughts \\nwere interrupted by the sound of approaching soldiers.\\nApprehensive, he \\nwent to the door and saw two soldiers dragging the elf down the hallway. When \\nhe could see her no more, Eragon slumped to the floor and tried to touch the \\nmagic again. Oaths flew from his lips when it eluded his grasp.\\nHe looked out at \\nthe city and ground his teeth. It was only midafternoon. Taking a calming \\nbreath, he tried to wait patiently.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 37': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nF IGHTINGSHADOWS\\nIt was dark in \\nEragon’s cell when he sat up with a start, electrified. The wrinkle had shifted! \\nHe had felt the magic at the edge of his consciousness for hours, but every \\ntime he tried to use it, nothing happened. Eyes bright with nervous energy, he \\nclenched his hands and said, “Nagz reisa!” With a flap, the cot’s blanket flew \\ninto the air and crumpled into a ball the size of his fist. It landed on the \\nfloor with a soft thump.\\nExhilarated, \\nEragon stood. He was weak from his enforced fast, but his excitement overcame \\nhis hunger.Now for the real test. He reached out with his mind and felt \\nthe lock on the door. Instead of trying to break or cut it, he simply pushed \\nits internal mechanism into the unlocked position. With a click, the door \\ncreaked inward.\\nWhen he had \\nfirst used magic to kill the Urgals in Yazuac, it had consumed nearly all of \\nhis strength, but he had grown much stronger since then. What once would have \\nexhausted him now only tired him slightly.\\nHe cautiously \\nstepped into the hall.I have to find Zar’roc and the elf. She must be in one \\nof these cells, but there isn’t time to look in them all. As for Zar’roc, the \\nShade might have it with him. He realized that his thinking was still \\nmuddled.Why am I out here? I could escape right now if I went back into the \\ncell and opened the window with magic. But then I wouldn’t be able to rescue \\nthe elf. . . . Saphira, where are you? I need your help. He silently \\nberated himself for not contacting her sooner. That should have been the first \\nthing he did after getting his power back.\\nHer reply came \\nwith surprising alacrity.Eragon! I’m over Gil’ead. Don’t do anything. \\nMurtagh is on the way.\\nWhat are—Footsteps \\ninterrupted him. He spun around, crouching as a squad of six soldiers marched \\ninto the hall. They halted abruptly, eyes flicking between Eragon and the open \\ncell door. Blood drained from their faces.Good, they know who I am.Maybe I \\ncan scare them off so we won’t have to fight.\\n“Charge!” yelled \\none of the soldiers, running forward. The rest of the men drew their blades and \\npounded down the hall.\\nIt was madness \\nto fight six men when he was unarmed and weak, but the thought of the elf kept \\nhim in place. He could not force himself to abandon her. Uncertain if the \\neffort would leave him standing, he pulled on his power and raised his hand, \\nthe gedwëy ignasia glowing. Fear showed in the soldiers’ eyes, but they were \\nhardened warriors and did not slow. As Eragon opened his mouth to pronounce the \\nfatal words, there was a low buzz, a flicker of motion. One of the men crashed \\nto the floor with an arrow in his back. Two more were struck before anyone \\nunderstood what was happening.\\nAt the end of \\nthe hall, where the soldiers had entered, stood a ragged, bearded man with a \\nbow. A crutch lay on the floor by his feet, apparently unneeded, for he stood \\ntall and straight.\\nThe three remaining \\nsoldiers turned to face this new threat. Eragon took advantage of the \\nconfusion. “Thrysta!” he shouted. One of the men clutched his chest and fell. \\nEragon staggered as the magic took its toll. Another soldier fell, pierced \\nthrough the neck with an arrow. “Don’t kill him!” called Eragon, seeing his \\nrescuer take aim at the last soldier. The bearded man lowered his bow.\\nEragon \\nconcentrated on the soldier before him. The man was breathing hard; the whites \\nof his eyes showed. He seemed to understand that his life was being spared.\\n“You’ve seen \\nwhat I can do,” said Eragon harshly. “If you don’t answer my questions, the \\nrest of your life will be spent in utter misery and torment. Now where’s my \\nsword—its sheath and blade are red—and what cell is the elf in?”\\nThe man clamped \\nhis mouth shut.\\nEragon’s palm \\nglowed ominously as he reached for the magic. “That was the wrong answer,” he \\nsnapped. “Do you know how much pain a grain of sand can cause you when it’s \\nembedded red hot in your stomach? Especially when it doesn’t cool off for the \\nnext twenty years and slowly burns its way down to your toes! By the time it \\ngets out of you, you’ll be an old man.” He paused for effect. “Unless you tell \\nme what I want.”\\nThe soldier’s \\neyes bulged, but he remained silent. Eragon scraped some dirt off the stone \\nfloor and observed dispassionately, “This is a bit more than a piece of sand, \\nbut be comforted; it’ll burn through you faster. Still, it’ll leave a bigger \\nhole.” At his word, the dirt shone cherry red, though it did not burn his hand.\\n“All right, just \\ndon’t put that in me!” yelped the soldier. “The elf’s in the last cell to the \\nleft! I don’t know about your sword, but it’s probably in the guardroom \\nupstairs. All the weapons are there.”\\nEragon nodded, \\nthen murmured, “Slytha.” The soldier’s eyes rolled up in his head, and he \\ncollapsed limply.\\n“Did you kill \\nhim?”\\nEragon looked at \\nthe stranger, who was now only a few paces away. He narrowed his eyes, trying \\nto see past the beard. “Murtagh! Is that you?” he exclaimed.\\n“Yes,” said \\nMurtagh, briefly lifting the beard from his shaven face. “I don’t want my face \\nseen. Did you kill him?”\\n“No, he’s only \\nasleep. How did you get in?”\\n“There’s no time \\nto explain. We have to get up to the next floor before anyone finds us. \\nThere’ll be an escape route for us in a few minutes. We don’t want to miss it.”\\n“Didn’t you hear \\nwhat I said?” asked Eragon, gesturing at the unconscious soldier. “There’s an \\nelf in the prison. I saw her! We have to rescue her. I need your help.”\\n“An elf . . . !” \\nMurtagh hurried down the hall, growling, “This is a mistake. We should flee \\nwhile we have the chance.” He stopped before the cell the soldier had indicated \\nand produced a ring of keys from under his ragged cloak. “I took it from one of \\nthe guards,” he explained.\\nEragon motioned \\nfor the keys. Murtagh shrugged and handed them to him. Eragon found the right \\none and swung the door open. A single beam of moonlight slanted through the \\nwindow, illuminating the elf’s face with cool silver.\\nShe faced him, \\ntense and coiled, ready for whatever would happen next. She held her head high, \\nwith a queen’s demeanor. Her eyes, dark green, almost black, and slightly \\nangled like a cat’s, lifted to Eragon’s. Chills shot through him.\\nTheir gaze held \\nfor a moment, then the elf trembled and collapsed soundlessly. Eragon barely \\ncaught her before she struck the floor. She was surprisingly light. The aroma \\nof freshly crushed pine needles surrounded her.\\nMurtagh entered \\nthe cell. “She’s beautiful!”\\n“But hurt.”\\n“We can tend to \\nher later. Are you strong enough to carry her?” Eragon shook his head. “Then \\nI’ll do it,” said Murtagh as he slung the elf across his shoulders. “Now, \\nupstairs!” He handed Eragon a dagger, then hurried back into the hall littered \\nwith soldiers’ bodies.\\nWith heavy \\nfootsteps Murtagh led Eragon to a stone-hewn staircase at the end of the hall. \\nAs they climbed it, Eragon asked, “How are we going to get out without being \\nnoticed?”\\n“We’re not,” \\ngrunted Murtagh.\\nThat did not \\nallay Eragon’s fears. He listened anxiously for soldiers or anyone else who \\nmight be nearby, dreading what might happen if they met the Shade. At the head \\nof the stairs was a banquet room filled with broad wooden tables. Shields lined \\nthe walls, and the wood ceiling was trussed with curved beams. Murtagh laid the \\nelf on a table and looked at the ceiling worriedly. “Can you talk to Saphira \\nfor me?”\\n“Yes.”\\n“Tell her to \\nwait another five minutes.”\\nThere were \\nshouts in the distance. Soldiers marched past the entrance to the banquet room. \\nEragon’s mouth tightened with pent-up tension. “Whatever you’re planning to do, \\nI don’t think we have much time.”\\n“Just tell her, \\nand stay out of sight,” snapped Murtagh, running off.\\nAs Eragon \\nrelayed the message, he was alarmed to hear men coming up the stairs. Fighting \\nhunger and exhaustion, he dragged the elf off the table and hid her underneath \\nit. He crouched next to her, holding his breath, tightly clenching the dagger.\\nTen soldiers \\nentered the room. They swept through it hurriedly, looking under only a couple \\nof tables, and continued on their way. Eragon leaned against a table leg, \\nsighing. The respite made him suddenly aware of his burning stomach and parched \\nthroat. A tankard and a plate of half-eaten food on the other side of the room \\ncaught his attention.\\nEragon dashed \\nfrom his hiding place, grabbed the food, then scurried back to the table. There \\nwas amber beer in the tankard, which he drank in two great gulps. Relief seeped \\nthrough him as the cool liquid ran down his throat, soothing the irritated \\ntissue. He suppressed a belch before ravenously tearing into a hunk of bread.\\nMurtagh returned \\ncarrying Zar’roc, a strange bow, and an elegant sword without a sheath. Murtagh \\ngave Zar’roc to Eragon. “I found the other sword and bow in the guardroom. I’ve \\nnever seen weapons like them before, so I assumed they were the elf’s.”\\n“Let’s find \\nout,” said Eragon through a mouthful of bread. The sword—slim and light with a \\ncurved crossguard, the ends of which narrowed into sharp points—fit the elf’s \\nsheath perfectly. There was no way to tell if the bow was hers, but it was \\nshaped so gracefully he doubted it could be anyone else’s. “What now?” he \\nasked, cramming another bite of food into his mouth. “We can’t stay here \\nforever. Sooner or later the soldiers will find us.”\\n“Now,” said \\nMurtagh, taking out his own bow and fitting an arrow to the string, “we wait. \\nLike I said, our escape has been arranged.”\\n“You don’t \\nunderstand; there’s a Shade here! If he finds us, we’re doomed.”\\n“A Shade!” \\nexclaimed Murtagh. “In that case, tell Saphira to come immediately. We were \\ngoing to wait until the watch changed, but delaying even that long is too \\ndangerous now.” Eragon relayed the message succinctly, refraining from \\ndistracting Saphira with questions. “You messed up my plans by escaping \\nyourself,” groused Murtagh, watching the room’s entrances for soldiers.\\nEragon smiled. \\n“In that case, perhaps I should have waited.Your timing was perfect, \\nthough. I wouldn’t have been able to even crawl if I had been forced to fight \\nall those soldiers with magic.”\\n“Glad to be of \\nsome use,” remarked Murtagh. He stiffened as they heard men running nearby. \\n“Let’s just hope the Shade doesn’t find us.”\\nA cold chuckle \\nfilled the banquet room. “I’m afraid it’s far too late for that.”\\nMurtagh and \\nEragon spun around. The Shade stood alone at the end of the room. In his hand \\nwas a pale sword with a thin scratch on the blade. He unclasped the brooch that \\nheld his cape in place and let the garment fall to the floor. His body was like \\na runner’s, thin and compact, but Eragon remembered Brom’s warning and knew \\nthat the Shade’s appearance was deceiving; he was many times stronger than a \\nnormal human.\\n“So, my youngRider, \\ndo you wish to test yourself against me?” sneered the Shade. “I shouldn’t have \\ntrusted the captain when he said you ate all your food. I will not make that \\nmistake again.”\\n“I’ll take care \\nof him,” said Murtagh quietly, putting down his bow and drawing his sword.\\n“No,” said \\nEragon under his breath. “He wants me alive, not you. I can stall him for a \\nshort while, but then you’d better have a way out for us.”\\n“Fine, go,” said \\nMurtagh. “You won’t have to hold him off for long.”\\n“I hope not,” \\nsaid Eragon grimly. He drew Zar’roc and slowly advanced. The red blade glinted \\nwith light from torches on the wall.\\nThe Shade’s \\nmaroon eyes burned like coals. He laughed softly. “Do you really think to \\ndefeat me, Du Súndavar Freohr? What a pitiful name. I would have expected \\nsomething more subtle from you, but I suppose that’s all you’re capable of.”\\nEragon refused \\nto let himself be goaded. He stared at the Shade’s face, waiting for a flicker \\nof his eyes or twitch of his lip, anything that would betray his next move.I \\ncan’t use magic for fear of provoking him to do the same. He has to think that \\nhe can win without resorting to it—which he probably can.\\nBefore either of \\nthem moved, the ceiling boomed and shook. Dust billowed from it and turned the \\nair gray while pieces of wood fell around them, shattering on the floor. From \\nthe roof came screams and the sound of clashing metal. Afraid of being brained \\nby the falling timber, Eragon flicked his eyes upward. The Shade took advantage \\nof his distraction and attacked.\\nEragon barely \\nmanaged to get Zar’roc up in time to block a slash at his ribs. Their blades \\nmet with a clang that jarred his teeth and numbed his arm.Hellfire! He’s \\nstrong! He grasped Zar’roc with both hands and swung with all of his might \\nat the Shade’s head. The Shade blocked him with ease, whipping his sword \\nthrough the air faster than Eragon had thought possible.\\nTerrible \\nscreeches sounded above them, like iron spikes being drawn across rock. Three \\nlong cracks split the ceiling. Shingles from the slate roof fell through the \\nfissures. Eragon ignored them, even when one smashed into the floor next to \\nhim. Though he had trained with a master of the blade, Brom, and with Murtagh, \\nwho was also a deadly swordsman, he had never been this outclassed. The Shade \\nwasplaying with him.\\nEragon retreated \\ntoward Murtagh, arms trembling as he parried the Shade’s blows. Each one seemed \\nmore powerful than the last. Eragon was no longer strong enough to call upon \\nmagic for help even if he had wanted to. Then, with a contemptuous flick of his \\nwrist, the Shade knocked Zar’roc out of Eragon’s hand. The force of the blow \\nsent him to his knees, where he stayed, panting. The screeching was louder than \\never. Whatever was happening, it was getting closer.\\nThe Shade stared \\ndown at him haughtily. “A powerful piece you may be in the game that is being \\nplayed, but I’m disappointed that this is your best. If the other Riders were this \\nweak, they must have controlled the Empire only through sheer numbers.”\\nEragon looked up \\nand shook his head. He had figured out Murtagh’s plan.Saphira, now would be \\na good time. “No, you forget something.”\\n“And what might \\nthat be?” asked the Shade mockingly.\\nThere was a \\nthunderous reverberation as a chunk of the ceiling was torn away to reveal the \\nnight sky. “The dragons!” roared Eragon over the noise, and threw himself out \\nof the Shade’s reach. The Shade snarled in rage, swinging his sword viciously. \\nHe missed and lunged. Surprise spread across his face as one of Murtagh’s \\narrows sprouted from his shoulder.\\nThe Shade \\nlaughed and snapped the arrow off with two fingers. “You’ll have to do better \\nthan that if you want to stop me.” The next arrow caught him between the eyes. \\nThe Shade howled with agony and writhed, covering his face. His skin turned \\ngray. Mist formed in the air around him, obscuring his figure. There was a \\nshattering cry; then the cloud vanished.\\nWhere the Shade \\nhad been, nothing was left but his cape and a pile of clothes. “You killed \\nhim!” exclaimed Eragon. He knew of only two heroes of legend who had survived \\nslaying a Shade.\\n“I’m not so \\nsure,” said Murtagh.\\nA man shouted, \\n“That’s it. He failed. Go in and get them!” Soldiers with nets and spears \\npoured into the banquet room from both ends. Eragon and Murtagh backed up \\nagainst the wall, dragging the elf with them. The men formed a menacing \\nhalf-circle around them. Then Saphira stuck her head through the hole in the \\nceiling and roared. She gripped the edge of the opening with her powerful \\ntalons and ripped off another large section of the ceiling.\\nThree soldiers \\nturned and ran, but the rest held their positions. With a resounding report, \\nthe center beam of the ceiling cracked and rained down heavy shingles. \\nConfusion scattered the ranks as they tried to dodge the deadly barrage. Eragon \\nand Murtagh pressed against the wall to avoid the falling debris. Saphira \\nroared again, and the soldiers fled, some getting crushed on the way.\\nWith a final \\ntitanic effort, Saphira tore off the rest of the ceiling before jumping into \\nthe banquet hall with her wings folded. Her weight splintered a table with a \\nsharp crunch. Crying out with relief, Eragon threw his arms around her. She \\nhummed contentedly.I’ve missed you, little one.\\nSame here. \\nThere’s someone else with us. Can you carry three? \\nOf course,she said, \\nkicking shingles and tables out of the way so she could take off. Murtagh and \\nEragon pulled the elf out of hiding. Saphira hissed in surprise as she saw her.An \\nelf!\\nYes, and the \\nwoman I saw in my dreams,said Eragon, picking up Zar’roc. He helped Murtagh \\nsecure the elf into the saddle, then they both climbed onto Saphira.I heard \\nfighting on the roof. Are there men up there?\\nThere were, but \\nno more. Are you ready? \\nYes. \\nSaphira leapt \\nout of the banquet hall and onto the fortress’s roof, where the bodies of \\nwatchmen lay scattered. “Look!” said Murtagh, pointing. A row of archers filed \\nout of a tower on the other side of the roofless hall.\\n“Saphira, you \\nhave to take off. Now!” warned Eragon.\\nShe unfurled her \\nwings, ran toward the edge of the building, and propelled them over it with her \\npowerful legs. The extra weight on her back made her drop alarmingly. As she \\nstruggled to gain altitude, Eragon heard the musical twang of bowstrings being \\nreleased.\\nArrows whizzed \\ntoward them in the dark. Saphira roared with pain as she was struck and quickly \\nrolled to the left to avoid the next volley. More arrows perforated the sky, but \\nthe night protected them from the shafts’ deadly bite. Distressed, Eragon bent \\nover Saphira’s neck.Where are you hurt?\\nMy wings are \\npierced . . . one of the arrows didn’t go all the way through. It’s still \\nthere.Her \\nbreathing was labored and heavy.\\nHow far can you \\ntake us?\\n\\nFar enough.Eragon clutched \\nthe elf tightly as they skimmed over Gil’ead, then left the city behind and \\nveered eastward, soaring upward through the night.\\nAW ARRIOR AND \\nAHEALER\\nSaphira drifted \\ndown to a clearing, landed on the crest of a hill, and rested her outstretched \\nwings on the ground. Eragon could feel her shaking beneath him. They were only \\na half-league from Gil’ead.\\nPicketed in the \\nclearing were Snowfire and Tornac, who snorted nervously at Saphira’s arrival. \\nEragon slid to the ground and immediately turned to Saphira’s injuries, while \\nMurtagh readied the horses.\\nUnable to see \\nwell in the darkness, Eragon ran his hands blindly over Saphira’s wings. He \\nfound three places where arrows had punctured the thin membrane, leaving bloody \\nholes as thick around as his thumb. A small piece had also been torn out of the \\nback edge of her left wing. She shivered when his fingers brushed the injuries. \\nHe tiredly healed the wounds with words from the ancient language. Then he went \\nto the arrow that was embedded in one of the large muscles of her flying arm. \\nThe arrowhead poked through its underside. Warm blood dripped off it.\\nEragon called \\nMurtagh over and instructed, “Hold her wing down. I have to remove this arrow.” \\nHe indicated where Murtagh should grip.This will be painful, he warned \\nSaphira,but it’ll be over quickly. Try not to struggle—you’ll hurt us.\\nShe extended her \\nneck and grabbed a tall sapling between her curved teeth. With a yank of her \\nhead, she pulled the tree out of the ground and clamped it firmly in her jaws.I’m \\nready.\\nOkay,said Eragon. \\n“Hold on,” he whispered to Murtagh, then broke off the head of the arrow. \\nTrying not cause any more damage, he swiftly pulled the shaft out of Saphira. \\nAs it left her muscle, she threw back her head and whimpered past the tree in \\nher mouth. Her wing jerked involuntarily, clipping Murtagh under the chin and \\nknocking him to the ground.\\nWith a growl, \\nSaphira shook the tree, spraying them with dirt before tossing it away. After \\nEragon sealed the wound, he helped Murtagh up. “She caught me by surprise,” \\nadmitted Murtagh, touching his scraped jaw.\\nI’m sorry. \\n“She didn’t mean \\nto hit you,” assured Eragon. He checked on the unconscious elf.You’re going \\nto have to carry her a bit longer, he told Saphira.We can’t take her on \\nthe horses and ride fast enough. Flying should be easier for you now that the \\narrow is out.\\nSaphira dipped \\nher head.I will do it.\\nThank you,said Eragon. He \\nhugged her fiercely.What you did was incredible; I’ll never forget it.\\nHer eyes \\nsoftened.I will go now. He backed away as she flew up in a flurry of \\nair, the elf’s hair streaming back. Seconds later they were gone. Eragon \\nhurried to Snowfire, pulled himself into the saddle, and galloped away with \\nMurtagh.\\nWhile they rode, \\nEragon tried to remember what he knew about elves. They had long lives—that \\nfact was oft repeated—although he knew not how long. They spoke the ancient \\nlanguage, and many could use magic. After the Riders’ fall, elves had retreated \\ninto seclusion. None of them had been seen in the Empire since.So why is one \\nhere now? And how did the Empire manage to capture her? If she can use magic, \\nshe’s probably drugged as I was.\\nThey traveled \\nthrough the night, not stopping even when their flagging strength began to slow \\nthem. They continued onward despite burning eyes and clumsy movements. Behind \\nthem, lines of torch-bearing horsemen searched around Gil’ead for their trail.\\nAfter many \\nbleary hours, dawn lightened the sky. By unspoken consent Eragon and Murtagh \\nstopped the horses. “We have to make camp,” said Eragon wearily. “I must \\nsleep—whether they catch us or not.”\\n“Agreed,” said \\nMurtagh, rubbing his eyes. “Have Saphira land. We’ll meet her.”\\nThey followed \\nSaphira’s directions and found her drinking from a stream at the base of a \\nsmall cliff, the elf still slouched on her back. Saphira greeted them with a \\nsoft bugle as Eragon dismounted.\\nMurtagh helped \\nhim remove the elf from Saphira’s saddle and lower her to the ground. Then they \\nsagged against the rock face, exhausted. Saphira examined the elf curiously.I \\nwonder why she hasn’t woken. It’s been hours since we left Gil’ead.\\nWho knows what \\nthey did to her?said \\nEragon grimly.\\nMurtagh followed \\ntheir gaze. “As far as I know, she’s the first elf the king has captured. Ever \\nsince they went into hiding, he’s been looking for them without success—until \\nnow. So he’s either found their sanctuary, or she was captured by chance. I \\nthink it was chance. If he had found the elf haven, he would have declared war \\nand sent his army after the elves. Since that hasn’t happened, the question is, \\nWere Galbatorix’s men able to extract the elves’ location before we rescued \\nher?”\\n“We won’t know \\nuntil she regains consciousness. Tell me what happened after I was captured. \\nHow did I end up in Gil’ead?”\\n“The Urgals are \\nworking for the Empire,” said Murtagh shortly, pushing back his hair. “And, it \\nseems, the Shade as well. Saphira and I saw the Urgals give you to him—though I \\ndidn’t know who it was at the time—and a group of soldiers. They were the ones \\nwho took you to Gil’ead.”\\nIt’s true,said Saphira, \\ncurling up next to them.\\nEragon’s mind \\nflashed back to the Urgals he had spoken with at Teirm and the “master” they \\nhad mentioned.They meant the king! I insulted the most powerful man in \\nAlagaësia! he realized with dread. Then he remembered the horror of the \\nslaughtered villagers in Yazuac. A sick, angry feeling welled in his stomach.The \\nUrgals were under Galbatorix’s orders! Why would he commit such an atrocity on \\nhis own subjects?\\nBecause he is \\nevil,stated \\nSaphira flatly.\\nGlowering, \\nEragon exclaimed, “This will mean war! Once the people of the Empire learn of \\nit, they will rebel and support the Varden.”\\nMurtagh rested \\nhis chin in his hand. “Even if they heard of this outrage, few would make it to \\nthe Varden. With the Urgals under his command, the king has enough warriors to \\nclose the Empire’s borders and remain in control, no matter how disruptive \\npeople are. With such a rule of terror, he will be able to shape the Empire \\nhowever he wants. And though he is hated, people could be galvanized into \\njoining him if they had a common enemy.”\\n“Who would that \\nbe?” asked Eragon, confused.\\n“The elves and \\nthe Varden. With the right rumors they can be portrayed as the most despicable \\nmonsters in Alagaësia—fiends who are waiting to seize your land and wealth. The \\nEmpire could even say that the Urgals have been misunderstood all this time and \\nthat they are really friends and allies against such terrible enemies. I only \\nwonder what the king promised them in return for their services.”\\n“It wouldn’t \\nwork,” said Eragon, shaking his head. “No one could be deceived that easily \\nabout Galbatorix and the Urgals. Besides, why would he want to do that? He’s \\nalready in power.”\\n“But his \\nauthority is challenged by the Varden, with whom people sympathize. There’s \\nalso Surda, which has defied him since it seceded from the Empire. Galbatorix \\nis strong within the Empire, but his arm is weak outside of it. As for people \\nseeing through his deceptions, they’ll believe whatever he wants them to. It’s \\nhappened before.” Murtagh fell silent and gazed moodily into the distance.\\nHis words \\ntroubled Eragon. Saphira touched him with her mind:Where is Galbatorix \\nsending the Urgals?\\nWhat? \\nIn both \\nCarvahall and Teirm, you heard that Urgals were leaving the area and migrating \\nsoutheast, as if to brave the Hadarac Desert. If the king truly does control \\nthem, why is he sending them in that direction? Maybe an Urgal army is being \\ngathered for his private use or an Urgal city is being formed. \\nEragon shuddered \\nat the thought.I’m too tired to figure it out. Whatever Galbatorix’s plans, \\nthey’ll only cause us trouble. I just wish that we knew where the Varden are. \\nThat’s where we should be going, but we’re lost without Dormnad. It doesn’t \\nmatter what we do; the Empire will find us.\\nDon’t give up,she said \\nencouragingly, then added dryly,though you’re probably right.\\nThanks.He looked at \\nMurtagh. “You risked your life to rescue me; I owe you for that. I couldn’t \\nhave escaped on my own.” It was more than that, though. There was a bond \\nbetween them now, welded in the brotherhood of battle and tempered by the \\nloyalty Murtagh had shown.\\n“I’m just glad I \\ncould help. It . . .” Murtagh faltered and rubbed his face. “My main worry now \\nis how we’re going to travel with so many men searching for us. Gil’ead’s \\nsoldiers will be hunting us tomorrow; once they find the horses’ tracks, \\nthey’ll know you didn’t fly away with Saphira.”\\nEragon glumly \\nagreed. “How did you manage to get into the castle?”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nsoftly. “By paying a steep bribe and crawling through a filthy scullery chute. \\nBut the plan wouldn’t have worked without Saphira. She,” he stopped and \\ndirected his words at her, “that is, you, are the only reason we escaped \\nalive.”\\nEragon solemnly \\nput a hand on her scaly neck. As she hummed contentedly, he gazed at the elf’s \\nface, captivated. Reluctantly, he dragged himself upright. “We should make a \\nbed for her.”\\nMurtagh got to \\nhis feet and stretched out a blanket for the elf. When they lifted her onto it, \\nthe cuff of her sleeve tore on a branch. Eragon began to pinch the fabric \\ntogether, then gasped.\\nThe elf’s arm \\nwas mottled with a layer of bruises and cuts; some were half healed, while \\nothers were fresh and oozing. Eragon shook his head with anger and pulled the \\nsleeve up higher. The injuries continued to her shoulder. With trembling \\nfingers, he unlaced the back of her shirt, dreading what might be under it.\\nAs the leather \\nslipped off, Murtagh cursed. The elf’s back was strong and muscled, but it was \\ncovered with scabs that made her skin look like dry, cracked mud. She had been \\nwhipped mercilessly and branded with hot irons in the shape of claws. Where her \\nskin was still intact, it was purple and black from numerous beatings. On her \\nleft shoulder was a tattoo inscribed with indigo ink. It was the same symbol \\nthat had been on the sapphire of Brom’s ring. Eragon silently swore an oath \\nthat he would kill whoever was responsible for torturing the elf.\\n“Can you heal \\nthis?” asked Murtagh.\\n“I—I don’t \\nknow,” said Eragon. He swallowed back sudden queasiness. “There’s so much.”\\nEragon!said Saphira \\nsharply.This is an elf. She cannot be allowed to die. Tired or not, hungry \\nor not, you must save her. I will meld my strength with yours, but you are the \\none who must wield the magic.\\nYes . . . you \\nare right,he \\nmurmured, unable to tear his eyes from the elf. Determined, he pulled off his \\ngloves and said to Murtagh, “This is going to take some time. Can you get me \\nfood? Also, boil rags for bandages; I can’t heal all her wounds.”\\n“We can’t make a \\nfire without being seen,” objected Murtagh. “You’ll have to use unwashed \\ncloths, and the food will be cold.” Eragon grimaced but acquiesced. As he \\ngently laid a hand on the elf’s spine, Saphira settled next to him, her \\nglittering eyes fixed on the elf. He took a deep breath, then reached for the \\nmagic and started working.\\nHe spoke the \\nancient words, “Waíse heill!” A burn shimmered under his palm, and new, \\nunmarked skin flowed over it, joining together without a scar. He passed over \\nbruises or other wounds that were not life-threatening—healing them all would \\nconsume the energy he needed for more serious injuries. As Eragon toiled, he \\nmarveled that the elf was still alive. She had been repeatedly tortured to the \\nedge of death with a precision that chilled him.\\nAlthough he \\ntried to preserve the elf’s modesty, he could not help but notice that \\nunderneath the disfiguring marks, her body was exceptionally beautiful. He was \\nexhausted and did not dwell upon it—though his ears turned red at times, and he \\nfervently hoped that Saphira did not know what he was thinking.\\nHe labored \\nthrough dawn, pausing only at brief intervals to eat and drink, trying to \\nreplenish himself from his fast, the escape, and now healing the elf. Saphira \\nremained by his side, lending her strength where she could. The sun was well \\ninto the sky when he finally stood, groaning as his cramped muscles stretched. \\nHis hands were gray and his eyes felt dry and gritty. He stumbled to the \\nsaddlebags and took a long drink from the wineskin. “Is it done?” asked \\nMurtagh.\\nEragon nodded, \\ntrembling. He did not trust himself to speak. The camp spun before him; he \\nnearly fainted.You did well, said Saphira soothingly.\\n“Will she live?”\\n“I don’t—don’t \\nknow,” he said in a ravaged voice. “Elves are strong, but even they cannot \\nendure abuse like this with impunity. If I knew more about healing, I might be \\nable to revive her, but . . .” He gestured helplessly. His hand was shaking so \\nbadly he spilled some of the wine. Another swig helped to steady him. “We’d \\nbetter start riding again.”\\n“No! You must \\nsleep,” protested Murtagh.\\n“I . . . can \\nsleep in the saddle. But we can’t afford to stay here, not with the soldiers \\nclosing on us.”\\nMurtagh \\nreluctantly gave in. “In that case I’ll lead Snowfire while you rest.” They resaddled \\nthe horses, strapped the elf onto Saphira, and departed the camp. Eragon ate \\nwhile he rode, trying to replace his depleted energy before he leaned forward \\nagainst Snowfire and closed his eyes.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 38': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nW ATER FROMSAND\\nWhen they stopped \\nfor the evening, Eragon felt no better and his temper had worsened. Most of the \\nday had been spent on long detours to avoid detection by soldiers with hunting \\ndogs. He dismounted Snowfire and asked Saphira,How is she?\\nI think no worse \\nthan before. She stirred slightly a few times, but that was all.Saphira crouched \\nlow to the ground to let him lift the elf out of the saddle. For a moment her \\nsoft form pressed against Eragon. Then he hurriedly put her down.\\nHe and Murtagh \\nmade a small dinner. It was difficult for them to fight off the urge to sleep. \\nWhen they had eaten, Murtagh said, “We can’t keep up this pace; we aren’t \\ngaining any ground on the soldiers. Another day or two of this and they’ll be \\nsure to overtake us.”\\n“What else can \\nwe do?” snapped Eragon. “If it were just the two of us and you were willing to \\nleave Tornac behind, Saphira could fly us out of here. But with the elf, too? \\nImpossible.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nat him carefully. “If you want to go your own way, I won’t stop you. I can’t \\nexpect you and Saphira to stay and risk imprisonment.”\\n“Don’t insult \\nme,” Eragon muttered. “The only reason I’m free is because of you. I’m not \\ngoing to abandon you to the Empire. Poor thanks that would be!”\\nMurtagh bowed \\nhis head. “Your words hearten me.” He paused. “But they don’t solve our \\nproblem.”\\n“What can?” \\nEragon asked. He gestured at the elf. “I wish she could tell us where the elves \\nare; perhaps we could seek sanctuary with them.”\\n“Considering how \\nthey’ve protected themselves, I doubt she’d reveal their location. Even if she \\ndid, the others of her kind might not welcome us. Why would they want to \\nshelter us anyway? The last Riders they had contact with were Galbatorix and \\nthe Forsworn. I doubt that left them with pleasant memories. And I don’t even \\nhave the dubious honor of being a Rider like you. No, they would not want me at \\nall.”\\nThey would \\naccept us,said \\nSaphira confidently as she shifted her wings to a more comfortable position.\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“Even if they would protect us, we can’t find them, and it’s impossible to ask \\nthe elf until she regains consciousness. We must flee, but in which \\ndirection—north, south, east, or west?”\\nMurtagh laced \\nhis fingers together and pressed his thumbs against his temples. “I think the \\nonly thing we can do is leave the Empire. The few safe places within it are far \\nfrom here. They would be difficult to reach without being caught or followed. . \\n. . There’s nothing for us to the north except the forest Du Weldenvarden—which \\nwe might be able to hide in, but I don’t relish going back past Gil’ead. Only \\nthe Empire and the sea lie westward. To the south is Surda, where you might be \\nable to find someone to direct you to the Varden. As for going east . . .” He \\nshrugged. “To the east, the Hadarac Desert stands between us and whatever lands \\nexist in that direction. The Varden are somewhere across it, but without \\ndirections it might take us years to find them.”\\nWe would be \\nsafe, though,remarked \\nSaphira.As long as we didn’t encounter any Urgals.\\nEragon knitted \\nhis brow. A headache threatened to drown his thoughts in hot throbs. “It’s too \\ndangerous to go to Surda. We would have to traverse most of the Empire, \\navoiding every town and village. There are too many people between us and Surda \\nto get there unnoticed.”\\nMurtagh raised \\nan eyebrow. “So you want to go across the desert?”\\n“I don’t see any \\nother options. Besides, that way we can leave the Empire before the Ra’zac get \\nhere. With their flying steeds, they’ll probably arrive in Gil’ead in a couple \\nof days, so we don’t have much time.”\\n“Even if we do \\nreach the desert before they get here,” said Murtagh, “they could still \\novertake us. It’ll be hard to outdistance them at all.”\\nEragon rubbed \\nSaphira’s side, her scales rough under his fingers. “That’s assuming they can \\nfollow our trail. To catch us, though, they’ll have to leave the soldiers \\nbehind, which is to our advantage. If it comes to a fight, I think the three of \\nus can defeat them . . . as long as we aren’t ambushed the way Brom and I \\nwere.”\\n“If we reach the \\nother side of the Hadarac safely,” said Murtagh slowly, “where will we go? \\nThose lands are well outside of the Empire. There will be few cities, if any. \\nAnd then there is the desert itself. What do you know of it?”\\n“Only that it’s \\nhot, dry, and full of sand,” confessed Eragon.\\n“That about sums \\nit up,” replied Murtagh. “It’s filled with poisonous and inedible plants, \\nvenomous snakes, scorpions, and a blistering sun. You saw the great plain on \\nour way to Gil’ead?”\\nIt was a rhetorical \\nquestion, but Eragon answered anyway, “Yes, and once before.”\\n“Then you are \\nfamiliar with its immense range. It fills the heart of the Empire. Now imagine \\nsomething two or three times its size, and you’ll understand the vastness of \\nthe Hadarac Desert. That is what you’re proposing to cross.”\\nEragon tried to \\nenvision a piece of land that gigantic but was unable to grasp the distances \\ninvolved. He retrieved the map of Alagaësia from his saddlebags. The parchment \\nsmelled musty as he unrolled it on the ground. He inspected the plains and \\nshook his head in amazement. “No wonder the Empire ends at the desert. \\nEverything on the other side is too far away for Galbatorix to control.”\\nMurtagh swept \\nhis hand over the right side of the parchment. “All the land beyond the desert, \\nwhich is blank on this map, was under one rule when the Riders lived. If the \\nking were to raise up new Riders under his command, it would allow him to \\nexpand the Empire to an unprecedented size. But that wasn’t the point I was \\ntrying to make. The Hadarac Desert is so huge and contains so many dangers, the \\nchances are slim that we can cross it unscathed. It is a desperate path to \\ntake.”\\n“Weare \\ndesperate,” said Eragon firmly. He studied the map carefully. “If we rode \\nthrough the belly of the desert, it would take well over a month, perhaps even \\ntwo, to cross it. But if we angle southeast, toward the Beor Mountains, we \\ncould cut through much faster. Then we can either follow the Beor Mountains \\nfarther east into the wilderness or go west to Surda. If this map is accurate, \\nthe distance between here and the Beors is roughly equal to what we covered on \\nour way to Gil’ead.”\\n“But that took \\nus nearly a month!”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead impatiently. “Our ride to Gil’ead was slow on account of my injuries. If we \\npress ourselves, it’ll take only a fraction of that time to reach the Beor \\nMountains.”\\n“Enough. You \\nmade your point,” acknowledged Murtagh. “Before I consent, however, something \\nmust be solved. As I’m sure you noticed, I bought supplies for us and the horses \\nwhile I was in Gil’ead. But how can we get enough water? The roving tribes who \\nlive in the Hadarac usually disguise their wells and oases so no one can steal \\ntheir water. And carrying enough for more than a day is impractical. Just think \\nabout how much Saphira drinks! She and the horses consume more water at one \\ntime than we do in a week. Unless you can make it rain whenever we need, I \\ndon’t see how we can go the direction you propose.”\\nEragon rocked \\nback on his heels. Making rain was well beyond his power. He suspected that not \\neven the strongest Rider could have done it. Moving that much air was like \\ntrying to lift a mountain. He needed a solution that would not drain all of his \\nstrength.I wonder if it’s possible to convert sand into water? That would \\nsolve our problem, but only if it doesn’t take too much energy.\\n“I have an \\nidea,” he said. “Let me experiment, then I’ll give you an answer.” Eragon \\nstrode out of the camp, with Saphira following closely.\\nWhat are you \\ngoing to try?she \\nasked.\\n“I don’t know,” \\nhe muttered.Saphira, could you carry enough water for us?\\nShe shook her \\nenormous head.No, I wouldn’t even be able to lift that much weight, let \\nalone fly with it.\\nToo bad.He knelt and \\npicked up a stone with a cavity large enough for a mouthful of water. He \\npressed a clump of dirt into the hollow and studied it thoughtfully. Now came \\nthe hard part. Somehow he had to convert the dirt into water.But what words \\nshould I use? He puzzled over it for a moment, then picked two he hoped \\nwould work. The icy magic rushed through him as he breached the familiar \\nbarrier in his mind and commanded, “Deloi moi!”\\nImmediately the \\ndirt began to absorb his strength at a prodigious rate. Eragon’s mind flashed \\nback to Brom’s warning that certain tasks could consume all of his power and \\ntake his life. Panic blossomed in his chest. He tried to release the magic but \\ncould not. It was linked to him until the task was complete or he was dead. All \\nhe could do was remain motionless, growing weaker every moment.\\nJust as he \\nbecame convinced that he would die kneeling there, the dirt shimmered and \\nmorphed into a thimbleful of water. Relieved, Eragon sat back, breathing hard. \\nHis heart pounded painfully and hunger gnawed at his innards.\\nWhat happened?asked Saphira.\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, still in shock from the drain on his body’s reserves. He was glad that he \\nhad not tried to transmute anything larger.This . . . this won’t work, \\nhe said.I don’t even have the strength to give myself a drink.\\nYou should have \\nbeen more careful,she \\nchided.Magic can yield unexpected results when the ancient words are \\ncombined in new ways.\\nHe glared at \\nher.I know that, but this was the only way I could test my idea. I wasn’t \\ngoing to wait until we were in the desert! He reminded himself that she was \\nonly trying to help.How did you turn Brom’s grave into diamond without \\nkilling yourself? I can barely handle a bit of dirt, much less all that \\nsandstone.\\nI don’t know how \\nI did it,she \\nstated calmly.It just happened.\\nCould you do it \\nagain, but this time make water? \\nEragon,she said, \\nlooking him squarely in the face.I’ve no more control over my abilities than \\na spider does. Things like that occur whether I will them or not. Brom told you \\nthat unusual events happen around dragons. He spoke truly. He gave no \\nexplanation for it, nor do I have one. Sometimes I can work changes just by \\nfeel, almost without thought. The rest of the time—like right now—I’m as \\npowerless as Snowfire.\\nYou’re never \\npowerless,he \\nsaid softly, putting a hand on her neck. For a long period they were both \\nquiet. Eragon remembered the grave he had made and how Brom lay within it. He \\ncould still see the sandstone flowing over the old man’s face. “At least we \\ngave him a decent burial,” he whispered.\\nHe idly swirled \\na finger in the dirt, making twisting ridges. Two of the ridges formed a \\nminiature valley, so he added mountains around it. With his fingernail he \\nscratched a river down the valley, then deepened it because it seemed too \\nshallow. He added a few more details until he found himself staring at a passable \\nreproduction of Palancar Valley. Homesickness welled up within him, and he \\nobliterated the valley with a swipe of his hand.\\nI don’t want to \\ntalk about it,he \\nmuttered angrily, staving off Saphira’s questions. He crossed his arms and \\nglared at the ground. Almost against his will, his eyes flicked back to where \\nhe had gouged the earth. He straightened, surprised. Though the ground was dry, \\nthe furrow he had made was lined with moisture. Curious, he scraped away more \\ndirt and found a damp layer a few inches under the surface. “Look at this!” he \\nsaid excitedly.\\nSaphira lowered \\nher nose to his discovery.How does this help us? Water in the desert is sure \\nto be buried so deeply we would have to dig for weeks to find it.\\nYes,said Eragon \\ndelightedly,but as long as it’s there, I can get it. Watch! He deepened \\nthe hole, then mentally accessed the magic. Instead of changing the dirt into \\nwater, he simply summoned forth the moisture that was already in the earth. \\nWith a faint trickle, water rushed into the hole. He smiled and sipped from it. \\nThe liquid was cool and pure, perfect for drinking.See! We can get all we \\nneed.\\nSaphira sniffed \\nthe pool.Here, yes. But in the desert? There may not be enough water in the \\nground for you to bring to the surface.\\nIt will work,Eragon assured \\nher.All I’m doing is lifting the water, an easy enough task. As long as it’s \\ndone slowly, my strength will hold. Even if I have to draw the water from fifty \\npaces down, it won’t be a problem. Especially if you help me.\\nSaphira looked \\nat him dubiously.Are you sure? Think carefully upon your answer, for it will \\nmean our lives if you are wrong.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then said firmly,I’m sure.\\nThen go tell \\nMurtagh. I will keep watch while you sleep. \\nBut you’ve \\nstayed up all night like us,he objected.You should rest.\\nI’ll be fine—I’m \\nstronger than you know,she said gently. Her scales rustled as she curled up \\nwith a watchful eye turned northward, toward their pursuers. Eragon hugged her, \\nand she hummed deeply, sides vibrating.Go.\\nHe lingered, \\nthen reluctantly returned to Murtagh, who asked, “Well? Is the desert open to \\nus?”\\n“It is,” \\nacknowledged Eragon. He flopped onto his blankets and explained what he had \\nlearned. When he finished, Eragon turned to the elf. Her face was the last \\nthing he saw before falling asleep.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 39': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HERAMRRIVER\\nThey forced \\nthemselves to rise early in the gray predawn hours. Eragon shivered in the cool \\nair. “How are we going to transport the elf? She can’t ride on Saphira’s back \\nmuch longer without getting sores from her scales. Saphira can’t carry her in \\nher claws—it tires her and makes landing dangerous. A sledge won’t work; it \\nwould get battered to pieces while we ride, and I don’t want the horses slowed \\nby the weight of another person.”\\nMurtagh \\nconsidered the matter as he saddled Tornac. “If you were to ride Saphira, we \\ncould lash the elf onto Snowfire, but we’d have the same problem with sores.”\\nI have a \\nsolution,said \\nSaphira unexpectedly.Why don’t you tie the elf to my belly? I’ll still be \\nable to move freely, and she will be safer than anywhere else. The only danger \\nwill be if soldiers shoot arrows at me, but I can easily fly above those.\\nNone of them \\ncould come up with a better idea, so they quickly adopted hers. Eragon folded \\none of his blankets in half lengthwise, secured it around the elf’s petite \\nform, then took her to Saphira. Blankets and spare clothes were sacrificed to \\nform ropes long enough to encircle Saphira’s girth. With those ropes, the elf \\nwas tied back-first against Saphira’s belly, her head between Saphira’s front \\nlegs. Eragon looked critically at their handiwork. “I’m afraid your scales may \\nrub through the ropes.”\\n“We’ll have to \\ncheck them occasionally for fraying,” commented Murtagh.\\nShall we go now?Saphira asked, \\nand Eragon repeated the question.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nsparked dangerously, a tight smile lifting his lips. He glanced back the way \\nthey had come, where smoke from soldiers’ camps was clearly visible, and said, \\n“I always did like races.”\\n“And now we are \\nin one for our lives!”\\nMurtagh swung \\ninto Tornac’s saddle and trotted out of the camp. Eragon followed close behind \\non Snowfire. Saphira jumped into the air with the elf. She flew low to the \\nground to avoid being seen by the soldiers. In this fashion, the three of them \\nmade their way southeast toward the distant Hadarac Desert.\\nEragon kept a \\nquick eye out for pursuers as he rode. His mind repeatedly wandered back to the \\nelf.An elf! He had actually seen one, and she was with them! He wondered \\nwhat Roran would think of that. It struck him that if he ever returned to \\nCarvahall, he would have a hard time convincing anyone that his adventures had \\nactually occurred.\\n\\xa0\\nFor the rest of \\nthe day, Eragon and Murtagh sped through the land, ignoring discomfort and fatigue. \\nThey drove the horses as hard as they could without killing them. Sometimes \\nthey dismounted and ran on foot to give Tornac and Snowfire a rest. Only twice \\ndid they stop—both times to let the horses eat and drink.\\nThough the \\nsoldiers of Gil’ead were far behind now, Eragon and Murtagh found themselves \\nhaving to avoid new soldiers every time they passed a town or village. Somehow \\nthe alarm had been sent ahead of them. Twice they were nearly ambushed along \\nthe trail, escaping only because Saphira happened to smell the men ahead of \\nthem. After the second incident, they avoided the trail entirely.\\nDusk softened \\nthe countryside as evening drew a black cloak across the sky. Through the night \\nthey traveled, relentlessly pacing out the miles. In the deepest hours of \\nnight, the ground rose beneath them to form low cactus-dotted hills.\\nMurtagh pointed \\nforward. “There’s a town, Bullridge, some leagues ahead that we must bypass. \\nThey’re sure to have soldiers watching for us. We should try to slip past them \\nnow while it’s dark.”\\nAfter three \\nhours they saw the straw-yellow lanterns of Bullridge. A web of soldiers \\npatrolled between watch fires scattered around the town. Eragon and Murtagh \\nmuffled their sword sheaths and carefully dismounted. They led the horses in a \\nwide detour around Bullridge, listening attentively to avoid stumbling on an \\nencampment.\\nWith the town \\nbehind them, Eragon relaxed slightly. Daybreak finally flooded the sky with a \\ndelicate blush and warmed the chilly night air. They halted on the crest of a hill \\nto observe their surroundings. The Ramr River was to their left, but it was \\nalso five miles to their right. The river continued south for several leagues, \\nthen doubled back on itself in a narrow loop before curving west. They had \\ncovered over sixteen leagues in one day.\\nEragon leaned \\nagainst Snowfire’s neck, happy with the distance they had gone. “Let’s find a \\ngully or hollow where we can sleep undisturbed.” They stopped at a small stand \\nof juniper trees and laid their blankets beneath them. Saphira waited patiently \\nas they untied the elf from her belly.\\n“I’ll take the \\nfirst watch and wake you at midmorning,” said Murtagh, setting his bare sword \\nacross his knees. Eragon mumbled his assent and pulled the blankets over his \\nshoulders.\\n\\xa0\\nNightfall found \\nthem worn and drowsy but determined to continue. As they prepared to leave, \\nSaphira observed to Eragon,This is the third night since we rescued you from \\nGil’ead, and the elf still hasn’t woken. I’m worried. And, she continued,she \\nhas neither drunk nor eaten in that time. I know little of elves, but she is \\nslender, and I doubt she can survive much longer without nourishment.\\n“What’s wrong?” \\nasked Murtagh over Tornac’s back.\\n“The elf,” said \\nEragon, looking down at her. “Saphira is troubled that she hasn’t woken or \\neaten; it disturbs me too. I healed her wounds, at least on the surface, but it \\ndoesn’t seem to have done her any good.”\\n“Maybe the Shade \\ntampered with her mind,” suggested Murtagh.\\n“Then we have to \\nhelp her.”\\nMurtagh knelt by \\nthe elf. He examined her intently, then shook his head and stood. “As far as I \\ncan tell, she’s only sleeping. It seems as if I could wake her with a word or a \\ntouch, yet she slumbers on. Her coma might be something elves self-induce to \\nescape the pain of injury, but if so, why doesn’t she end it? There’s no danger \\nto her now.”\\n“But does she \\nknow that?” asked Eragon quietly.\\nMurtagh put a \\nhand on his shoulder. “This must wait. We have to leave now or risk losing our \\nhard-won lead. You can tend to her later when we stop.”\\n“One thing first,” \\nsaid Eragon. He soaked a rag, then squeezed the cloth so water dripped between \\nthe elf’s sculpted lips. He did that several times and dabbed above her \\nstraight, angled eyebrows, feeling oddly protective.\\n\\xa0\\nThey headed \\nthrough the hills, avoiding the tops for fear of being spotted by sentries. \\nSaphira stayed with them on the ground for the same reason. Despite her bulk, \\nshe was stealthy; only her tail could be heard scraping over the ground, like a \\nthick blue snake.\\nEventually the \\nsky brightened in the east. The morning star Aiedail appeared as they reached \\nthe edge of a steep bank covered with mounds of brush. Water roared below as it \\ntore over boulders and sluiced through branches.\\n“The Ramr!” said \\nEragon over the noise.\\nMurtagh nodded. \\n“Yes! We have to find a place to ford safely.”\\nThat isn’t \\nnecessary,said \\nSaphira.I can carry you across, no matter how wide the river is.\\nEragon looked up \\nat her blue-gray form.What about the horses? We can’t leave them behind. \\nThey’re too heavy for you to lift.\\nAs long as \\nyou’re not on them and they don’t struggle too much, I’m sure that I can carry \\nthem. If I can dodge arrows with three people on my back, I can certainly fly a \\nhorse in a straight line over a river. \\nI believe you, \\nbut let’s not attempt it unless we have to. It’s too dangerous. \\nShe clambered \\ndown the embankment.We can’t afford to squander time here.\\nEragon followed \\nher, leading Snowfire. The bank came to an abrupt end at the Ramr, where the \\nriver ran dark and swift. White mist wafted up from the water, like blood \\nsteaming in winter. It was impossible to see the far side. Murtagh tossed a \\nbranch into the torrent and watched it race away, bobbing on the rough water.\\n“How deep do you \\nthink it is?” asked Eragon.\\n“I can’t tell,” \\nsaid Murtagh, worry coloring his voice. “Can you see how far across it is with \\nmagic?”\\n“I don’t think \\nso, not without lighting up this place like a beacon.”\\nWith a gust of \\nair, Saphira took off and soared over the Ramr. After a short time, she said,I’m \\non the other bank. The river is over a half-mile wide. You couldn’t have chosen \\na worse place to cross; the Ramr bends at this point and is at its widest.\\n“A half-mile!” \\nexclaimed Eragon. He told Murtagh about Saphira’s offer to fly them.\\n“I’d rather not \\ntry it, for the horses’ sake. Tornac isn’t as accustomed to Saphira as \\nSnowfire. He might panic and injure them both. Ask Saphira to look for shallows \\nwhere we can swim over safely. If there aren’t any within a mile in either \\ndirection, then I suppose she can ferry us.”\\nAt Eragon’s request, \\nSaphira agreed to search for a ford. While she explored, they hunkered next to \\nthe horses and ate dry bread. It was not long before Saphira returned, her \\nvelvet wings whispering in the early dawn sky.The water is both deep and \\nstrong, upstream as well as downstream.\\nOnce he was \\ntold, Murtagh said, “I’d better go over first, so I can watch the horses.” He \\nscrambled onto Saphira’s saddle. “Be careful with Tornac. I’ve had him for many \\nyears. I don’t want anything to happen to him.” Then Saphira took off.\\nWhen she \\nreturned, the unconscious elf had been untied from her belly. Eragon led Tornac \\nto Saphira, ignoring the horse’s low whinnies. Saphira reared back on her \\nhaunches to grasp the horse around the belly with her forelegs. Eragon eyed her \\nformidable claws and said, “Wait!” He repositioned Tornac’s saddle blanket, \\nstrapping it to the horse’s belly so it protected his soft underside, then \\ngestured for Saphira to proceed.\\nTornac snorted \\nin fright and tried to bolt when Saphira’s forelegs clamped around his sides, \\nbut she held him tightly. The horse rolled his eyes wildly, the whites rimming \\nhis dilated pupils. Eragon tried to gentle Tornac with his mind, but the \\nhorse’s panic resisted his touch. Before Tornac could try to escape again, \\nSaphira jumped skyward, her hind legs thrusting with such force that her claws \\ngouged the rocks underneath. Her wings strained furiously, struggling to lift \\nthe enormous load. For a moment it seemed she would fall back to the ground. \\nThen, with a lunge, she shot into the air. Tornac screamed in terror, kicking \\nand tossing. It was a terrible sound, like screeching metal.\\nEragon swore, \\nwondering if anyone was close enough to hear.You’d better hurry, Saphira. \\nHe listened for soldiers as he waited, scanning the inky landscape for the \\ntelltale flash of torches. It soon met his eye in a line of horsemen sliding \\ndown a bluff almost a league away.\\nAs Saphira \\nlanded, Eragon brought Snowfire to her.Murtagh’s silly animal is in \\nhysterics. He had to tie Tornac down to prevent him from running away. She \\ngripped Snowfire and carried him off, ignoring the horse’s trumpeted \\nprotestations. Eragon watched her go, feeling lonely in the night. The horsemen \\nwere only a mile away.\\nFinally Saphira \\ncame for him, and they were soon on firm ground once more, with the Ramr to \\ntheir backs. Once the horses were calmed and the saddles readjusted, they \\nresumed their flight toward the Beor Mountains. The air filled with the calls \\nof birds waking to a new day.\\nEragon dozed \\neven when walking. He was barely aware that Murtagh was just as drowsy. There \\nwere times when neither of them guided the horses, and it was only Saphira’s \\nvigilance that kept them on course.\\nEventually the \\nground became soft and gave way under their feet, forcing them to halt. The sun \\nwas high overhead. The Ramr River was no more than a fuzzy line behind them.\\nThey had reached \\nthe Hadarac Desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 40': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEHADARACDESERT\\nAvast expanse of \\ndunes spread to the horizon like ripples on an ocean. Bursts of wind twirled \\nthe reddish gold sand into the air. Scraggly trees grew on scattered patches of \\nsolid ground—ground any farmer would have declared unfit for crops. Rising in \\nthe distance was a line of purple crags. The imposing desolation was barren of \\nany animals except for a bird gliding on the zephyrs.\\n“You’re sure \\nwe’ll find food for the horses out there?” queried Eragon, slurring his words. \\nThe hot, dry air stung his throat.\\n“See those?” \\nasked Murtagh, indicating the crags. “Grass grows around them. It’s short and \\ntough, but the horses will find it sufficient.”\\n“I hope you’re \\nright,” said Eragon, squinting at the sun. “Before we continue, let’s rest. My \\nmind is slow as a snail, and I can barely move my legs.”\\nThey untied the \\nelf from Saphira, ate, then lay in the shadow of a dune for a nap. As Eragon \\nsettled into the sand, Saphira coiled up next to him and spread her wings over \\nthem.This is a wondrous place, she said.I could spend years here and \\nnot notice the passing time.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes.It would be a nice place to fly, he agreed drowsily.\\nNot only that, I \\nfeel as though I was made for this desert. It has the space I need, mountains \\nwhere I could roost, and camouflaged prey that I could spend days hunting. And \\nthe warmth! Cold does not disturb me, but this heat makes me feel alive and \\nfull of energy.She \\ncraned her head toward the sky, stretching happily.\\nYou like it that \\nmuch?mumbled \\nEragon.\\nYes. \\nThen when this \\nis all done, perhaps we can return. . . .He drifted into slumber even as \\nhe spoke. Saphira was pleased and hummed gently while he and Murtagh rested.\\nIt was the \\nmorning of the fourth day since leaving Gil’ead. They had already covered \\nthirty-five leagues.\\n\\xa0\\nThey slept just \\nlong enough to clear their minds and rest the horses. No soldiers could be seen \\nto the rear, but that did not lull them into slowing their pace. They knew that \\nthe Empire would keep searching until they were far beyond the king’s reach. \\nEragon said, “Couriers must have carried news of my escape to Galbatorix. He \\nwould have alerted the Ra’zac. They’re sure to be on our trail by now. It’ll \\ntake them a while to catch us even by flying, but we should be ready for them \\nat all times.”\\nAnd this time \\nthey will find I am not so easily bound with chains,said Saphira.\\nMurtagh \\nscratched his chin. “I hope they won’t be able to follow us past Bullridge. The \\nRamr was an effective way to lose pursuers; there’s a good chance our tracks \\nwon’t be found again.”\\n“Something to \\nhope for indeed,” said Eragon as he checked the elf. Her condition was \\nunchanged; she still did not react to his ministrations. “I place no faith in \\nluck right now, though. The Ra’zac could be on our trail even as we speak.”\\n\\xa0\\nAt sunset they \\narrived at the crags they had viewed from afar that morning. The imposing stone \\nbluffs towered over them, casting thin shadows. The surrounding area was free \\nof dunes for a half mile. Heat assailed Eragon like a physical blow as he \\ndismounted Snowfire onto the baked, cracked ground. The back of his neck and \\nhis face were sunburned; his skin was hot and feverish.\\nAfter picketing \\nthe horses where they could nibble the sparse grass, Murtagh started a small \\nfire. “How far do you think we went?” Eragon asked, releasing the elf from \\nSaphira.\\n“I don’t know!” \\nsnapped Murtagh. His skin was red, his eyes bloodshot. He picked up a pot and \\nmuttered a curse. “We don’t have enough water. And the horses have to drink.”\\nEragon was just \\nas irritated by the heat and dryness, but he held his temper in check. “Bring \\nthe horses.” Saphira dug a hole for him with her claws, then he closed his \\neyes, releasing the spell. Though the ground was parched, there was enough \\nmoisture for the plants to live on and enough for him to fill the hole several \\ntimes over.\\nMurtagh refilled \\nthe waterskins as water pooled in the hole, then stood aside and let the horses \\ndrink. The thirsty animals quaffed gallons. Eragon was forced to draw the \\nliquid from ever deeper in the earth to satisfy their desire. It taxed his \\nstrength to the limit. When the horses were finally sated, he said to Saphira,If \\nyou need a drink, take it now. Her head snaked around him and she took two \\nlong draughts, but no more.\\nBefore letting \\nthe water flow back into the ground, Eragon gulped down as much as he could, \\nthen watched the last drops melt back into the dirt. Holding the water on the \\nsurface was harder than he had expected.But at least it’s within my \\nabilities, he reflected, remembering with some amusement how he had once \\nstruggled to lift even a pebble.\\n\\xa0\\nIt was freezing \\nwhen they rose the next day. The sand had a pink hue in the morning light, and \\nthe sky was hazy, concealing the horizon. Murtagh’s mood had not improved with \\nsleep, and Eragon found his own rapidly deteriorating. During breakfast, he \\nasked, “Do you think it’ll be long before we leave the desert?”\\nMurtagh \\nglowered. “We’re only crossing a small section of it, so I can’t imagine that \\nit’ll take us more than two or three days.”\\n“But look how \\nfar we’ve already come.”\\n“All right, \\nmaybe it won’t! All I care about right now is getting out of the Hadarac as \\nquickly as possible. What we’re doing is hard enough without having to pick \\nsand from our eyes every few minutes.”\\nThey finished \\neating, then Eragon went to the elf. She lay as one dead—a corpse except for \\nher measured breathing. “Where lies your injury?” whispered Eragon, brushing a \\nstrand of hair from her face. “How can you sleep like this and yet live?” The \\nimage of her, alert and poised in the prison cell, was still vivid in his mind. \\nTroubled, he prepared the elf for travel, then saddled and mounted Snowfire.\\nAs they left the \\ncamp, a line of dark smudges became visible on the horizon, indistinct in the \\nhazy air. Murtagh thought they were distant hills. Eragon was not convinced, \\nbut he could make out no details.\\nThe elf’s plight \\nfilled his thoughts. He was sure that something had to be done to help her or \\nshe would die, though he knew not what that might be. Saphira was just as \\nconcerned. They talked about it for hours, but neither of them knew enough \\nabout healing to solve the problem confronting them.\\nAt midday they \\nstopped for a brief rest. When they resumed their journey, Eragon noticed that \\nthe haze had thinned since morning, and the distant smudges had gained \\ndefinition.\\nNo longer were \\nthey indistinct purple-blue lumps, but rather broad, forest-covered mounds with \\nclear outlines. The air above them was pale white, bleached of its usual \\nhue—all color seemed to have been leached out of a horizontal band of sky that \\nlay on top of the hills and extended to the horizon’s edges.\\nHe stared, \\npuzzled, but the more he tried to make sense of it, the more confused he \\nbecame. He blinked and shook his head, thinking that it must be some illusion \\nof the desert air. Yet when he opened his eyes, the annoying incongruity was \\nstill there. Indeed, the whiteness blanketed half the sky before them. Sure \\nthat something was terribly wrong, he started to point this out to Murtagh and \\nSaphira when he suddenly understood what he was seeing.\\nWhat they had \\ntaken to be hills were actually the bases of gigantic mountains, scores of \\nmiles wide. Except for the dense forest along their lower regions, the \\nmountains were entirely covered with snow and ice. It was this that had \\ndeceived Eragon into thinking the sky white. He craned back his neck, searching \\nfor the peaks, but they were not visible. The mountains stretched up into the \\nsky until they faded from sight. Narrow, jagged valleys with ridges that nearly \\ntouched split the mountains like deep gorges. It was like a ragged, toothy wall \\nlinking Alagaësia with the heavens.\\nThere’s no end \\nto them!he \\nthought, awestruck. Stories that mentioned the Beor Mountains always noted \\ntheir size, but he had discounted such reports as fanciful embellishments. Now, \\nhowever, he was forced to acknowledge their authenticity.\\nSensing his \\nwonder and surprise, Saphira followed his gaze with her own. Within a few \\nseconds she recognized the mountains for what they were.I feel like a \\nhatchling again. Compared to them, even I feel small!\\nWe must be near \\nthe edge of the desert,said Eragon.It’s only taken two days and we can \\nalready see the far side and beyond!\\nSaphira spiraled \\nabove the dunes.Yes, but considering the size of those peaks, they could \\nstill be fifty leagues from here. It’s hard to gauge distances against \\nsomething so immense. Wouldn’t they be a perfect hiding place for the elves or \\nthe Varden?\\nYou could hide \\nmore than the elves and Varden,he stated.Entire nations could exist \\nin secret there, hidden from the Empire. Imagine living with those behemoths \\nlooming over you!He guided Snowfire to Murtagh and pointed, grinning.\\n“What?” grunted \\nMurtagh, scanning the land.\\n“Look closely,” \\nurged Eragon.\\nMurtagh peered \\nclosely at the horizon. He shrugged. “What, I don’t—” The words died in his \\nmouth and gave way to slack-jawed wonder. Murtagh shook his head, muttering, \\n“That’s impossible!” He squinted so hard that the corners of his eyes crinkled. \\nHe shook his head again. “I knew the Beor Mountains were large, but not that \\nmonstrous size!”\\n“Let’s hope the \\nanimals that live there aren’t in proportion to the mountains,” said Eragon \\nlightly.\\nMurtagh smiled. \\n“It will be good to find some shade and spend a few weeks in leisure. I’ve had \\nenough of this forced march.”\\n“I’m tired too,” \\nadmitted Eragon, “but I don’t want to stop until the elf is cured . . . or she \\ndies.”\\n“I don’t see how \\ncontinuing to travel will help her,” said Murtagh gravely. “A bed will do her \\nmore good than hanging underneath Saphira all day.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“Maybe . . . When we reach the mountains, I could take her to Surda—it’s not \\nthat far. There must be a healer there who can help her; we certainly can’t.”\\nMurtagh shaded \\nhis eyes with his hand and stared at the mountains. “We can talk about it \\nlater. For now our goal is to reach the Beors. There, at least, the Ra’zac will \\nhave trouble finding us, and we will be safe from the Empire.”\\nAs the day wore \\non, the Beor Mountains seemed to get no closer, though the landscape changed \\ndramatically. The sand slowly transformed from loose grains of reddish hue to \\nhard-packed, dusky-cream dirt. In place of dunes were ragged patches of plants \\nand deep furrows in the ground where flooding had occurred. A cool breeze \\nwafted through the air, bringing welcome refreshment. The horses sensed the \\nchange of climate and hurried forward eagerly.\\nWhen evening \\nsubdued the sun, the mountains’ foothills were a mere league away. Herds of \\ngazelles bounded through lush fields of waving grass. Eragon caught Saphira \\neyeing them hungrily. They camped by a stream, relieved to be out of the \\npunishing Hadarac Desert.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 41': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAP ATHREVEALED\\nFatigued and \\nhaggard, but with triumphant smiles, they sat around the fire, congratulating \\neach other. Saphira crowed jubilantly, which startled the horses. Eragon stared \\nat the flames. He was proud that they had covered roughly sixty leagues in five \\ndays. It was an impressive feat, even for a rider able to change mounts \\nregularly.\\nI am outside of \\nthe Empire.It \\nwas a strange thought. He had been born in the Empire, lived his entire life \\nunder Galbatorix’s rule, lost his closest friends and family to the king’s \\nservants, and had nearly died several times within his domain. Now Eragon was \\nfree. No more would he and Saphira have to dodge soldiers, avoid towns, or hide \\nwho they were. It was a bittersweet realization, for the cost had been the loss \\nof his entire world.\\nHe looked at the \\nstars in the gloaming sky. And though the thought of building a home in the \\nsafety of isolation appealed to him, he had witnessed too many wrongs committed \\nin Galbatorix’s name, from murder to slavery, to turn his back on the Empire. \\nNo longer was it just vengeance—for Brom’s death as well as Garrow’s—that drove \\nhim. As a Rider, it was his duty to assist those without strength to resist \\nGalbatorix’s oppression.\\nWith a sigh he \\nabandoned his deliberation and observed the elf stretched out by Saphira. The fire’s \\norange light gave her face a warm cast. Smooth shadows flickered under her \\ncheekbones. As he stared, an idea slowly came to him.\\nHe could hear \\nthe thoughts of people and animals—and communicate with them in that manner if \\nhe chose to—but it was something he had done infrequently except with Saphira. \\nHe always remembered Brom’s admonishment not to violate someone’s mind unless \\nabsolutely necessary. Save for the one time he had tried to probe Murtagh’s \\nconsciousness, he had refrained from doing so.\\nNow, however, he \\nwondered if it were possible to contact the elf in her comatose state.I \\nmight be able to learn from her memories why she remains like this. But if she \\nrecovers, would she forgive me for such an intrusion? . . . Whether she does or \\nnot, I must try. She’s been in this condition for almost a week. Without \\nspeaking of his intentions to Murtagh or Saphira, he knelt by the elf and \\nplaced his palm on her brow.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes and extended a tendril of thought, like a probing finger, toward the elf’s \\nmind. He found it without difficulty. It was not fuzzy and filled with pain as \\nhe had anticipated, but lucid and clear, like a note from a crystal bell. \\nSuddenly an icy dagger drove into his mind. Pain exploded behind his eyes with \\nsplashes of color. He recoiled from the attack but found himself held in an \\niron grip, unable to retreat.\\nEragon fought as \\nhard as he could and used every defense he could think of. The dagger stabbed \\ninto his mind again. He frantically threw his own barriers before it, blunting \\nthe attack. The pain was less excruciating than the first time, but it jarred \\nhis concentration. The elf took the opportunity to ruthlessly crush his \\ndefenses.\\nA stifling \\nblanket pressed down on Eragon from all directions, smothering his thoughts. The \\noverpowering force slowly contracted, squeezing the life out of him bit by bit, \\nthough he held on, unwilling to give up.\\nThe elf \\ntightened her relentless grip even more, so as to extinguish him like a snuffed \\ncandle. He desperately cried in the ancient language, “Eka aí fricai un \\nShur’tugal!” I am a Rider and friend! The deadly embrace did not loosen its \\nhold, but its constriction halted and surprise emanated from her.\\nSuspicion \\nfollowed a second later, but he knew she would believe him; he could not have \\nlied in the ancient language. However, while he had said he was a friend, that \\ndid not mean he meant her no harm. For all she knew, Eragon believed himself to \\nbe her friend, making the statement true for him, thoughshe might not \\nconsider him one.The ancient language does have its limitations, thought \\nEragon, hoping that the elf would be curious enough to risk freeing him.\\nShe was. The \\npressure lifted, and the barriers around her mind hesitantly lowered. The elf \\nwarily let their thoughts touch, like two wild animals meeting for the first \\ntime. A cold shiver ran down Eragon’s side. Her mind was alien. It felt vast \\nand powerful, weighted with memories of uncounted years. Dark thoughts loomed \\nout of sight and touch, artifacts of her race that made him cringe when they \\nbrushed his consciousness. Yet through all the sensations shimmered a melody of \\nwild, haunting beauty that embodied her identity.\\nWhat is your \\nname?she \\nasked, speaking in the ancient language. Her voice was weary and filled with \\nquiet despair.\\nEragon. And \\nyours?Her \\nconsciousness lured him closer, inviting him to submerge himself in the lyric \\nstrains of her blood. He resisted the summons with difficulty, though his heart \\nached to accept it. For the first time he understood the fey attraction of elves. \\nThey were creatures of magic, unbound by the mortal laws of the land—as \\ndifferent from humans as dragons were from animals.\\n. . . Arya. Why \\nhave you contacted me in this manner? Am I still a captive of theEmpire? \\nNo, you are \\nfree!said \\nEragon. Though he knew only scattered words in the ancient language, he managed \\nto convey:I was imprisoned in Gil’ead, like you, but I escaped and rescued \\nyou. In the five days since then, we’ve crossed the edge of the Hadarac Desert \\nand are now camped by the Beor Mountains. You’ve not stirred nor said a word in \\nall that time.\\nAh . . . so it \\nwas Gil’ead.She \\npaused.I know that my wounds were healed. At the time I did not understand \\nwhy—preparation for some new torture, I was certain. Now I realize it was you. \\nSoftly she added,Even so, I have not risen, and you are puzzled.\\nYes. \\nDuring my \\ncaptivity, a rare poison, the Skilna Bragh, was given to me, along with the \\ndrug to suppress my power. Every morning the antidote for the previous day’s \\npoison was administered to me, by force if I refused to take it. Without it I \\nwill die within a few hours. That is why I lie in this trance—it slows the \\nSkilna Bragh’s progress, though does not stop it. . . . I contemplated waking \\nfor the purpose of ending my life and denyingGalbatorix, but I refrained from \\ndoing so out of hope that you might be an ally. . . .Her voice \\ndwindled off weakly.\\nHow long can you \\nremain like this?asked \\nEragon.\\nFor weeks, but \\nI’m afraid I haven’t that much time. This dormancy cannot restrain death \\nforever . . . I can feel it in my veins even now. Unless I receive the \\nantidote, I will succumb to the poison in three or four days. \\nWhere can the \\nantidote be found?\\n\\nIt exists in \\nonly two places outside of the Empire: with my own people and with the Varden. \\nHowever, my home is beyond the reach of dragonback. \\nWhat about the \\nVarden? We would have taken you straight to them, but we don’t know where they \\nare.\\n\\nI will tell \\nyou—if you give me your word that you will never reveal their location to \\nGalbatorix or to anyone who serves him. In addition you must swear that you \\nhave not deceived me in some manner and that you intend no harm to the elves, \\ndwarves, Varden, or the race of dragons. \\nWhat Arya asked \\nfor would have been simple enough—if they had not been conversing in the \\nancient language. Eragon knew she wanted oaths more binding than life itself. \\nOnce made, they could never be broken. That weighed heavily on him as he \\ngravely pledged his word in agreement.\\nIt is \\nunderstood. . . .A \\nseries of vertigo-inducing images suddenly flashed through his mind. He found \\nhimself riding along the Beor Mountain range, traveling eastward many leagues. \\nEragon did his best to remember the route as craggy mountains and hills flashed \\npast. He was heading south now, still following the mountains. Then everything \\nwheeled abruptly, and he entered a narrow, winding valley. It snaked through \\nthe mountains to the base of a frothy waterfall that pounded into a deep lake.\\nThe images \\nstopped.It is far, said Arya,but do not let the distance dissuade \\nyou. When you arrive at the lake Kóstha-mérna at the end of the Beartooth \\nRiver, take a rock, bang on the cliff next to the waterfall, and cry, Aí \\nvarden abr du Shur’tugals gata vanta.You will be admitted. You will be \\nchallenged, but do not falter no matter how perilous it seems.\\nWhat should they \\ngive you for the poison?he asked.\\nHer voice \\nquavered, but then she regained her strength.Tell them—to give me Túnivor’s \\nNectar. You must leave me now . . . I have expended too much energy already. Do \\nnot talk with me again unless there is no hope of reaching the Varden. If that \\nis the case, there is information I must impart to you so the Varden will \\nsurvive. Farewell, Eragon, rider of dragons . . . my life is in your hands.\\nArya withdrew \\nfrom their contact. The unearthly strains that had echoed across their link \\nwere gone. Eragon took a shuddering breath and forced his eyes open. Murtagh \\nand Saphira stood on either side of him, watching with concern. “Are you all \\nright?” asked Murtagh. “You’ve been kneeling here for almost fifteen minutes.”\\n“I have?” asked \\nEragon, blinking.\\nYes, and \\ngrimacing like a pained gargoyle,commented Saphira dryly.\\nEragon stood, \\nwincing as his cramped knees stretched. “I talked with Arya!” Murtagh frowned \\nquizzically, as if to inquire if he had gone mad. Eragon explained, “The \\nelf—that’s her name.”\\nAnd what is it \\nthat ails her?asked \\nSaphira impatiently.\\nEragon swiftly \\ntold them of his entire discussion. “How far away are the Varden?” asked \\nMurtagh.\\n“I’m not exactly \\nsure,” confessed Eragon. “From what she showed me, I think it’s even farther \\nthan from here to Gil’ead.”\\n“And we’re \\nsupposed to cover that in three or four days?” demanded Murtagh angrily. “It \\ntook us fivelong days to get here! What do you want to do, kill the \\nhorses? They’re exhausted as it is.”\\n“But if we do \\nnothing, she’ll die! If it’s too much for the horses, Saphira can fly ahead \\nwith Arya and me; at least we would get to the Varden in time. You could catch \\nup with us in a few days.”\\nMurtagh grunted \\nand crossed his arms. “Of course. Murtagh the pack animal. Murtagh the horse \\nleader. I should have remembered that’s all I’m good for nowadays. Oh, and \\nlet’s not forget, every soldier in the Empire is searching for me now because \\nyou couldn’t defend yourself, and I had to go andsave you. Yes, I \\nsuppose I’ll just follow your instructions and bring up the horses in the rear \\nlike a good servant.”\\nEragon was \\nbewildered by the sudden venom in Murtagh’s voice. “What’s wrong with you? I’m \\ngrateful for what you did. There’s no reason to be angry with me! I didn’t ask \\nyou to accompany me or to rescue me from Gil’ead. You chose that. I haven’t \\nforced you to do anything.”\\n“Oh, not openly, \\nno. What else could I do but help you with the Ra’zac? And then later, at \\nGil’ead, how could I have left with a clear conscience? The problem with you,” \\nsaid Murtagh, poking Eragon in the chest, “is that you’re so totally helpless \\nyou force everyone to take care of you!”\\nThe words stung \\nEragon’s pride; he recognized a grain of truth in them. “Don’t touch me,” he \\ngrowled.\\nMurtagh laughed, \\na harsh note in his voice. “Or what, you’ll punch me? You couldn’t hit a brick \\nwall.” He went to shove Eragon again, but Eragon grabbed his arm and struck him \\nin the stomach.\\n“I said, don’t \\ntouch me!”\\nMurtagh doubled \\nover, swearing. Then he yelled and launched himself at Eragon. They fell in a \\ntangle of arms and legs, pounding on each other. Eragon kicked at Murtagh’s \\nright hip, missed, and grazed the fire. Sparks and burning embers scattered \\nthrough the air.\\nThey scrabbled \\nacross the ground, trying to get leverage. Eragon managed to get his feet under \\nMurtagh’s chest and kicked mightily. Murtagh flew upside down over Eragon’s \\nhead, landing flat on his back with a solid thump.\\nMurtagh’s breath \\nwhooshed out. He rolled stiffly to his feet, then wheeled to face Eragon, \\npanting heavily. They charged each other once more. Saphira’s tail slapped \\nbetween them, accompanied by a deafening roar. Eragon ignored her and tried to \\njump over her tail, but a taloned paw caught him in midair and flung him back \\nto the ground.\\nEnough! \\nHe futilely \\ntried to push Saphira’s muscled leg off his chest and saw that Murtagh was \\nlikewise pinned. Saphira roared again, snapping her jaws. She swung her head \\nover Eragon and glared at him.You of all people should know better! Fighting \\nlike starving dogs over a scrap of meat. What would Brom say?\\nEragon felt his \\ncheeks burn and averted his eyes. He knew what Brom would have said. Saphira \\nheld them on the ground, letting them simmer, then said to Eragon pointedly,Now, \\nif you don’t want to spend the night under my foot, you will politely ask \\nMurtagh what is troubling him. She snaked her head over to Murtagh and \\nstared down at him with an impassive blue eye.And tell him that I won’t \\nstand for insults from either of you.\\nWon’t you let us \\nup?complained \\nEragon.\\nNo. \\nEragon \\nreluctantly turned his head toward Murtagh, tasting blood in the side of his \\nmouth. Murtagh avoided his eyes and looked up at the sky. “Well, is she going to \\nget off us?”\\n“No, not unless \\nwe talk. . . . She wants me to ask you what’s really the problem,” said Eragon, \\nembarrassed.\\nSaphira growled \\nan affirmative and continued to stare at Murtagh. It was impossible for him to \\nescape her piercing glare. Finally he shrugged, muttering something under his \\nbreath. Saphira’s claws tightened on his chest, and her tail whistled through \\nthe air. Murtagh shot her an angry glance, then grudgingly said louder, “I told \\nyou before: I don’t want to go to the Varden.”\\nEragon frowned. \\nWas that all that was the matter? “Don’t want to . . . or can’t?”\\nMurtagh tried to \\nshove Saphira’s leg off him, then gave up with a curse. “Don’t want to! They’ll \\nexpect things from me that I can’t deliver.”\\n“Did you steal \\nsomething from them?”\\n“I wish it were \\nthat simple.”\\nEragon rolled \\nhis eyes, exasperated. “Well, what is it, then? Did you kill someone important \\nor bed the wrong woman?”\\n“No, I was \\nborn,” said Murtagh cryptically. He pushed at Saphira again. This time she \\nreleased them both. They got to their feet under her watchful eye and brushed \\ndirt from their backs.\\n“You’re avoiding \\nthe question,” Eragon said, dabbing his split lip.\\n“So what?” spat \\nMurtagh as he stomped to the edge of the camp. After a minute he sighed. “It \\ndoesn’t matter why I’m in this predicament, but I can tell you that the Varden \\nwouldn’t welcome me even if I came bearing the king’s head. Oh, they might \\ngreet me nicely enough and let me into their councils, but trust me? Never. And \\nif I were to arrive under less fortuitous circumstances, like the present ones, \\nthey’d likely clap me in irons.”\\n“Won’t you tell \\nme what this is about?” asked Eragon. “I’ve done things I’m not proud of, too, \\nso it’s not as if I’m going to pass judgment.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head slowly, eyes glistening. “It isn’t like that. I haven’tdone \\nanything to deserve this treatment, though it would have been easier to atone \\nfor if I had. No . . . my only wrongdoing is existing in the first place.” He \\nstopped and took a shaky breath. “You see, my father—”\\nA sharp hiss \\nfrom Saphira cut him off abruptly.Look!\\nThey followed \\nher gaze westward. Murtagh’s face paled. “Demons above and below!”\\nA league or so \\naway, parallel to the mountain range, was a column of figures marching east. \\nThe line of troops, hundreds strong, stretched for nearly a mile. Dust billowed \\nfrom their heels. Their weapons glinted in the dying light. A standard-bearer \\nrode before them in a black chariot, holding aloft a crimson banner.\\n“It’s the \\nEmpire,” said Eragon tiredly. “They’ve found us . . . somehow.” Saphira poked \\nher head over his shoulder and gazed at the column.\\n“Yes . . . but \\nthose are Urgals, not men,” said Murtagh.\\n“How can you \\ntell?”\\nMurtagh pointed \\nat the standard. “That flag bears the personal symbol of an Urgal chieftain. \\nHe’s a ruthless brute, given to violent fits and insanity.”\\n“You’ve met \\nhim?”\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\ntightened. “Once, briefly. I still have scars from that encounter. These Urgals \\nmight not have been sent here for us, but I’m sure we’ve been seen by now and \\nthat they will follow us. Their chieftain isn’t the sort to let a dragon escape \\nhis grasp, especially if he’s heard about Gil’ead.”\\nEragon hurried \\nto the fire and covered it with dirt. “We have to flee! You don’t want to go to \\nthe Varden, but I have to take Arya to them before she dies. Here’s a \\ncompromise: come with me until I reach the lake Kóstha-mérna, then go your own \\nway.” Murtagh hesitated. Eragon added quickly, “If you leave now, in sight of \\nthe column, Urgals will follow you. And then where will you be, facing them \\nalone?”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Murtagh, tossing his saddlebags over Tornac’s flanks, “but when we near \\nthe Varden, Iwill leave.”\\nEragon burned to \\nquestion Murtagh further, but not with Urgals so near. He gathered his \\nbelongings and saddled Snowfire. Saphira fanned her wings, took off in a rush, \\nand circled above. She kept guard over Murtagh and Eragon as they left camp.\\nWhat direction \\nshall I fly?she \\nasked.\\nEast, along the \\nBeors.\\n\\nStilling her \\nwings, Saphira rose on an updraft and teetered on the pillar of warm air, \\nhovering in the sky over the horses. I wonder why the Urgals are here. Maybe \\nthey were sent to attack the Varden.\\nThen we should \\ntry to warn them,he \\nsaid, guiding Snowfire past half-visible obstacles. As the night deepened, the \\nUrgals faded into the gloom behind them.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 42': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nAC LASH OFWILLS\\nWhen morning \\ncame, Eragon’s cheek was raw from chafing against Snowfire’s neck, and he was \\nsore from his fight with Murtagh. They had alternated sleeping in their saddles \\nthroughout the night. It had allowed them to outdistance the Urgal troops, but \\nneither of them knew if the lead could be retained. The horses were exhausted \\nto the point of stopping, yet they still maintained a relentless pace. Whether \\nit would be enough to escape depended on how rested the monsters were . . . and \\nif Eragon and Murtagh’s horses survived.\\nThe Beor \\nMountains cast great shadows over the land, stealing the sun’s warmth. To the \\nnorth was the Hadarac Desert, a thin white band as bright as noonday snow.\\nI must eat,said Saphira.Days \\nhave passed since I last hunted. Hunger claws my belly. If I start now, I might \\nbe able to catch enough of those bounding deer for a few mouthfuls.\\nEragon smiled at \\nher exaggeration.Go if you must, but leave Arya here.\\nI will be swift.He untied the \\nelf from her belly and transferred her to Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira soared \\naway, disappearing in the direction of the mountains. Eragon ran beside the \\nhorses, close enough to Snowfire to keep Arya from falling. Neither he nor \\nMurtagh intruded on the silence. Yesterday’s fight no longer seemed as \\nimportant because of the Urgals, but the bruises remained.\\n\\xa0\\nSaphira made her \\nkills within the hour and notified Eragon of her success. Eragon was pleased \\nthat she would soon return. Her absence made him nervous.\\nThey stopped at \\na pond to let the horses drink. Eragon idly plucked a stalk of grass, twirling \\nit while he stared at the elf. He was startled from his reverie by the steely \\nrasp of a sword being unsheathed. He instinctively grasped Zar’roc and spun around \\nin search of the enemy. There was only Murtagh, his long sword held ready. He \\npointed at a hill ahead of them, where a tall, brown-cloaked man sat on a \\nsorrel horse, mace in hand. Behind him was a group of twenty horsemen. No one \\nmoved. “Could they be Varden?” asked Murtagh.\\nEragon \\nsurreptitiously strung his bow. “According to Arya, they’re still scores of \\nleagues away. This might be one of their patrols or raiding groups.”\\n“Assuming \\nthey’re not bandits.” Murtagh swung onto Tornac and readied his own bow.\\n“Should we try \\nto outrun them?” asked Eragon, draping a blanket over Arya. The horsemen must \\nhave seen her, but he hoped to conceal the fact that she was an elf.\\n“It wouldn’t do \\nany good,” said Murtagh, shaking his head. “Tornac and Snowfire are fine \\nwar-horses, but they’re tired, and they aren’t sprinters. Look at the horses \\nthose men have; they’re meant for running. They would catch us before we had \\ngone a half-mile. Besides, they may have something important to say. You’d \\nbetter tell Saphira to hurry back.”\\nEragon was \\nalready doing that. He explained the situation, then warned,Don’t show \\nyourself unless it’s necessary. We’re not in the Empire, but I still don’t want \\nanyone to know about you.\\nNever mind that,she replied.Remember, \\nmagic can protect you where speed and luck fail. He felt her take off and \\nrace toward them, skimming close to the ground.\\nThe band of men \\nwatched them from the hill.\\nEragon nervously \\ngripped Zar’roc. The wire-wrapped hilt was secure under his glove. He said in a \\nlow voice, “If they threaten us, I can frighten them away with magic. If that \\ndoesn’t work, there’s Saphira. I wonder how they’d react to a Rider? So many \\nstories have been told about their powers. . . . It might be enough to avoid a fight.”\\n“Don’t count on \\nit,” said Murtagh flatly. “If there’s a fight, we’ll just have to kill enough \\nof them to convince them we’re not worth the effort.” His face was controlled \\nand unemotional.\\nThe man on the \\nsorrel horse signaled with his mace, sending the horsemen cantering toward \\nthem. The men shook javelins over their heads, whooping loudly as they neared. \\nBattered sheaths hung from their sides. Their weapons were rusty and stained. \\nFour of them trained arrows on Eragon and Murtagh.\\nTheir leader \\nswirled the mace in the air, and his men responded with yells as they wildly \\nencircled Eragon and Murtagh. Eragon’s lips twitched. He almost loosed a blast \\nof magic into their midst, then restrained himself.We don’t know what they \\nwant yet, he reminded himself, containing his growing apprehension.\\nThe moment \\nEragon and Murtagh were thoroughly surrounded, the leader reined in his horse, \\nthen crossed his arms and examined them critically. He raised his eyebrows. \\n“Well, these are better than the usual dregs we find! At least we got healthy \\nones this time. And we didn’t even have to shoot them. Grieg will be pleased.” \\nThe men chuckled.\\nAt his words, a \\nsinking sensation filled Eragon’s gut. A suspicion stirred in his mind.Saphira \\n. . .\\n“Now as for you \\ntwo,” said the leader, speaking to Eragon and Murtagh, “if you would be so good \\nas to drop your weapons, you’ll avoid being turned into living quivers by my \\nmen.” The archers grinned suggestively; the men laughed again.\\nMurtagh’s only \\nmovement was to shift his sword. “Who are you and what do you want? We are free \\nmen traveling through this land. You have no right to stop us.”\\n“Oh, I have \\nevery right,” said the man contemptuously. “And as for my name,slaves do \\nnot address their masters in that manner, unless they want to be beaten.”\\nEragon cursed to \\nhimself.Slavers! He remembered vividly the people he had seen at auction \\nin Dras-Leona. Rage boiled within him. He glared at the men around him with new \\nhatred and disgust.\\nThe lines \\ndeepened on the leader’s face. “Throw down your swords and surrender!” The \\nslavers tensed, staring at them with cold eyes as neither Eragon nor Murtagh \\nlowered his weapon. Eragon’s palm tingled. He heard a rustle behind him, then a \\nloud curse. Startled, he spun around.\\nOne of the \\nslavers had pulled the blanket off Arya, revealing her face. He gaped in \\nastonishment, then shouted, “Torkenbrand, this one’s an elf!” The men stirred \\nwith surprise while the leader spurred his horse over to Snowfire. He looked \\ndown at Arya and whistled.\\n“Well, ’ow much \\nis she worth?” someone asked.\\nTorkenbrand was \\nquiet for a moment, then spread his hands and said, “At the very least? \\nFortunes upon fortunes. The Empire will pay a mountain of gold for her!”\\nThe slavers \\nyelled with excitement and pounded each other on the back. A roar filled \\nEragon’s mind as Saphira banked sharply far overhead.Attack now! he \\ncried.But let them escape if they run. She immediately folded her wings \\nand plummeted downward. Eragon caught Murtagh’s attention with a sharp signal. \\nMurtagh took the cue. He smashed his elbow into a slaver’s face, knocking the \\nman out of his saddle, and jabbed his heels into Tornac.\\nWith a toss of \\nhis mane, the war-horse jumped forward, twirled around, and reared. Murtagh \\nbrandished his sword as Tornac plunged back down, driving his forehooves into \\nthe back of the dismounted slaver. The man screamed.\\nBefore the \\nslavers could gather their senses, Eragon scrambled out of the commotion and \\nraised his hands, invoking words in the ancient language. A globule of indigo \\nfire struck the ground in the midst of the fray, bursting into a fountain of \\nmolten drops that dissipated like sun-warmed dew. A second later, Saphira \\ndropped from the sky and landed next to him. She parted her jaws, displaying \\nher massive fangs, and bellowed. “Behold!” cried Eragon over the furor, “I am a \\nRider!” He raised Zar’roc over his head, the red blade dazzling in the \\nsunlight, then pointed it at the slavers. “Flee if you wish to live!”\\nThe men shouted \\nincoherently and scrambled over each other in their haste to escape. In the \\nconfusion, Torkenbrand was struck in the temple with a javelin. He tumbled to \\nthe ground, stunned. The men ignored their fallen leader and raced away in a \\nragged mass, casting fearful looks at Saphira.\\nTorkenbrand \\nstruggled to his knees. Blood ran from his temple, branching across his cheek \\nwith crimson tendrils. Murtagh dismounted and strode over to him, sword in \\nhand. Torkenbrand weakly raised his arm as if to ward off a blow. Murtagh gazed \\nat him coldly, then swung his blade at Torkenbrand’s neck. “No!” shouted \\nEragon, but it was too late.\\nTorkenbrand’s \\ndecapitated trunk crumpled to the ground in a puff of dirt. His head landed \\nwith a hard thump. Eragon rushed to Murtagh, his jaw working furiously. “Is \\nyour brain rotten?” he yelled, enraged. “Why did you kill him?”\\nMurtagh wiped \\nhis sword on the back of Torkenbrand’s jerkin. The steel left a dark stain. “I \\ndon’t see why you’re so upset—”\\n“Upset!” \\nexploded Eragon. “I’m well past that! Did it even occur to you that we could \\njust leave him here and continue on our way? No! Instead you turn into an \\nexecutioner and chop off his head. He was defenseless!”\\nMurtagh seemed \\nperplexed by Eragon’s wrath. “Well, we couldn’t keep him around—hewas dangerous. \\nThe others ran off . . . without a horse he wouldn’t have made it far. I didn’t \\nwant the Urgals to find him and learn about Arya. So I thought it would—”\\n“But tokill \\nhim?” interrupted Eragon. Saphira sniffed Torkenbrand’s head curiously. She opened \\nher mouth slightly, as if to snap it up, then appeared to decide better of it \\nand prowled to Eragon’s side.\\n“I’m only trying \\nto stay alive,” stated Murtagh. “No stranger’s life is more important than my \\nown.”\\n“But you can’t \\nindulge in wanton violence. Where is your empathy?” growled Eragon, pointing at \\nthe head.\\n“Empathy? \\nEmpathy? What empathy can I afford my enemies? Shall I dither about whether to \\ndefend myself because it will cause someone pain? If that had been the case, I \\nwould have died years ago! You must be willing to protect yourself and what you \\ncherish, no matter what the cost.”\\nEragon slammed \\nZar’roc back into its sheath, shaking his head savagely. “You can justify any \\natrocity with that reasoning.”\\n“Do you think I \\nenjoy this?” Murtagh shouted. “My life has been threatened from the day I was \\nborn! All of my waking hours have been spent avoiding danger in one form or \\nanother. And sleep never comes easily because I always worry if I’ll live to \\nsee the dawn. If there ever was a time I felt secure, it must have been in my \\nmother’s womb, though I wasn’t safe even there! You don’t understand—if you \\nlived with thisfear, you would have learned the same lesson I did:Do \\nnot take chances. ” He gestured at Torkenbrand’s body. “He was a risk that \\nI removed. I refuse to repent, and I won’t plague myself over what is done and \\npast.”\\nEragon shoved \\nhis face into Murtagh’s. “It was still the wrong thing to do.” He lashed Arya \\nto Saphira, then climbed onto Snowfire. “Let’s go.” Murtagh guided Tornac \\naround Torkenbrand’s prone form in the bloodstained dust.\\n\\xa0\\nThey rode at a \\nrate that Eragon would have thought impossible a week ago; leagues melted away \\nbefore them as if wings were attached to their feet. They turned south, between \\ntwo outstretched arms of the Beor Mountains. The arms were shaped like pincers \\nabout to close, the tips a day’s travel apart. Yet the distance seemed less \\nbecause of the mountains’ size. It was as if they were in a valley made for \\ngiants.\\nWhen they \\nstopped for the day, Eragon and Murtagh ate dinner in silence, refusing to look \\nup from their food. Afterward, Eragon said tersely, “I’ll take the first \\nwatch.” Murtagh nodded and lay on his blankets with his back to Eragon.\\nDo you want to \\ntalk?asked \\nSaphira.\\nNot right now,murmured Eragon.Give \\nme some time to think; I’m . . . confused.\\nShe withdrew \\nfrom his mind with a gentle touch and a whisper.I love you, little one.\\nAnd I you,he said. She \\ncurled into a ball next to him, lending him her warmth. He sat motionless in \\nthe dark, wrestling with his disquiet.\\nF LIGHTTHROUGHTHEVALLEY\\nIn the morning \\nSaphira took off with both Eragon and Arya. Eragon wanted to get away from \\nMurtagh for a time. He shivered, pulling his clothes tighter. It looked like it \\nmight snow. Saphira ascended lazily on an updraft and asked,What are you \\nthinking?\\nEragon \\ncontemplated the Beor Mountains, which towered above them even though Saphira \\nflew far above the ground.That was murder yesterday. I’ve no other word for \\nit.\\nSaphira banked \\nto the left. It was a hasty deed and ill considered, but Murtagh tried to do \\nthe right thing. The men who buy and sell other humans deserve every misfortune \\nthat befalls them. If we weren’t committed to helping Arya, I would hunt down \\nevery slaver and tear them apart!\\nYes,said Eragon \\nmiserably,but Torkenbrand was helpless. He couldn’t shield himself or run. A \\nmoment more and he probably would have surrendered. Murtagh didn’t give him \\nthat chance. If Torkenbrand had at least been able to fight, it wouldn’t have \\nbeen so bad.\\nEragon, even if \\nTorkenbrand had fought, the results would have been the same. You know as well \\nas I do that few can equal you or Murtagh with the blade. Torkenbrand would \\nhave still died, though you seem to think it would have been more just or honorable \\nin a mismatched duel.\\n\\nI don’t know \\nwhat’s right!admitted \\nEragon, distressed.There aren’t any answers that make sense.\\nSometimes,said Saphira \\ngently,there are no answers. Learn what you can about Murtagh from this. \\nThen forgive him. And if you can’t forgive, at least forget, for he meant you \\nno harm, however rash the act was. Your head is still attached, yes?\\nFrowning, Eragon \\nshifted in the saddle. He shook himself, like a horse trying to rid itself of a \\nfly, and checked Murtagh’s position over Saphira’s shoulder. A patch of color \\nfarther back along their route caught his attention.\\nCamped by a \\nstreambed they had crossed late yesterday were the Urgals. Eragon’s heartbeat \\nquickened. How could the Urgals be on foot, yet still gain on them? Saphira saw \\nthe monsters as well and tilted her wings, brought them close to her body, and \\nslipped into a steep dive, splitting the air.I don’t think they spotted us, \\nshe said.\\nEragon hoped \\nnot. He squinted against the blast of air as she increased the angle of their \\ndive.Their chieftain must be driving them at a breakneck pace, he said.\\nYes—maybe \\nthey’ll all die of exhaustion. \\nWhen they \\nlanded, Murtagh asked curtly, “What now?”\\n“The Urgals are \\novertaking us,” said Eragon. He pointed back toward the column’s camp.\\n“How far do we \\nstill have to go?” asked Murtagh, putting his hands against the sky and \\nmeasuring the hours until sunset.\\n“Normally? . . . \\nI would guess another five days. At the speed we’ve been traveling, only three. \\nBut unless we get there tomorrow, the Urgals will probably catch us, and Arya \\nwill certainly die.”\\n“She might last \\nanother day.”\\n“We can’t count \\non it,” objected Eragon. “The only way we can get to the Varden in time is if \\nwe don’t stop for anything, least of all sleep. That’s our only chance.”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nbitterly. “How can you expect to do that? We’ve already gone days without \\nadequate sleep. Unless Riders are made of different stuff than us mortals, \\nyou’re as tired as I am. We’ve covered a staggering distance, and the horses, \\nin case you haven’t noticed, are ready to drop. Another day of this might kill \\nus all.”\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“So be it. We don’t have a choice.”\\nMurtagh gazed at \\nthe mountains. “I could leave and let you fly ahead with Saphira. . . . That \\nwould force the Urgals to divide their troops and would give you a better \\nchance of reaching the Varden.”\\n“It would be \\nsuicide,” said Eragon, crossing his arms. “Somehow those Urgals are faster on \\nfoot than we are on horseback. They would run you down like a deer. The only \\nway to evade them is to find sanctuary with the Varden.” Despite his words, he \\nwas unsure if he wanted Murtagh to stay.I like him, Eragon confessed to \\nhimself,but I’m no longer certain if that’s a good thing.\\n“I’ll escape \\nlater,” said Murtagh abruptly. “When we get to the Varden, I can disappear down \\na side valley and find my way to Surda, where I can hide without attracting too \\nmuch attention.”\\n“So you’re \\nstaying?”\\n“Sleep or no \\nsleep, I’ll see you to the Varden,” promised Murtagh.\\n\\xa0\\nWith newfound \\ndetermination, they struggled to distance themselves from the Urgals, yet their \\npursuers continued to creep nearer. At nightfall the monsters were a third \\ncloser than they had been that morning. As fatigue eroded his and Murtagh’s \\nstrength, they slept in turns on the horses, while whoever was awake led the \\nanimals in the right direction.\\nEragon relied \\nheavily on Arya’s memories to guide them. Because of the alien nature of her \\nmind, he sometimes made mistakes as to the route, costing them precious time. \\nThey gradually angled toward the foothills of the eastern arm of mountains, \\nlooking for the valley that would lead them to the Varden. Midnight arrived and \\npassed without any sign of it.\\n\\xa0\\nWhen the sun \\nreturned, they were pleased to see that the Urgals were far behind. “This is \\nthe last day,” said Eragon, yawning widely. “If we’re not reasonably close to \\nthe Varden by noon, I’m going to fly ahead with Arya. You’ll be free to go \\nwherever you want then, but you’ll have to take Snowfire with you. I won’t be \\nable to come back for him.”\\n“That might not \\nbe necessary; we could still get there in time,” said Murtagh. He rubbed the \\npommel of his sword.\\nEragon shrugged. \\n“We could.” He went to Arya and put a hand on her forehead. It was damp and \\ndangerously hot. Her eyes wandered uneasily beneath her eyelids, as if she \\nsuffered a nightmare. Eragon pressed a damp rag to her brow, wishing he could \\ndo more.\\n\\xa0\\nLate in the \\nmorning, after they circumnavigated an especially broad mountain, Eragon saw a \\nnarrow valley tucked against its far side. The valley was so restricted it \\ncould easily be overlooked. The Beartooth River, which Arya had mentioned, \\nflowed out of it and looped carelessly across the land. He smiled with relief; \\nthat was where they needed to go.\\nLooking back, \\nEragon was alarmed to see that the distance between them and the Urgals had \\nshrunk to little more than a league. He pointed out the valley to Murtagh. “If \\nwe can slip in there without being seen, it might confuse them.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nskeptical. “It’s worth a try. But they’ve followed us easily enough so far.”\\nAs they \\napproached the valley, they passed under the knotted branches of the Beor \\nMountains’ forest. The trees were tall, with creviced bark that was almost \\nblack, dull needles of the same color, and knobby roots that rose from the soil \\nlike bare knees. Cones littered the ground, each the size of a horse’s head. \\nSable squirrels chattered from the treetops, and eyes gleamed from holes in the \\ntrunks. Green beards of tangled wolfsbane hung from the gnarled branches.\\nThe forest gave \\nEragon an uneasy feeling; the hair on the back of his neck prickled. There was \\nsomething hostile in the air, as if the trees resented their intrusion.They \\nare very old, said Saphira, touching a trunk with her nose.\\nYes,said Eragon,but \\nnot friendly. The forest grew denser the farther in they traveled. The lack \\nof space forced Saphira to take off with Arya. Without a clear trail to follow, \\nthe tough underbrush slowed Eragon and Murtagh. The Beartooth River wound next \\nto them, filling the air with the sound of gurgling water. A nearby peak \\nobscured the sun, casting them into premature dusk.\\nAt the valley’s \\nmouth, Eragon realized that although it looked like a slim gash between the \\npeaks, the valley was really as wide as many of the Spine’s vales. It was only \\nthe enormous size of the ridged and shadowy mountains that made it appear so \\nconfined. Waterfalls dotted its sheer sides. The sky was reduced to a thin \\nstrip winding overhead, mostly hidden by gray clouds. From the dank ground rose \\na clinging fog that chilled the air until their breath was visible. Wild \\nstrawberries crawled among a carpet of mosses and ferns, fighting for the \\nmeager sunlight. Sprouting on piles of rotting wood were red and yellow \\ntoadstools.\\nAll was hushed \\nand quiet, sounds dampened by the heavy air. Saphira landed by them in a nearby \\nglade, the rush of her wings strangely muted. She took in the view with a swing \\nof her head.I just passed a flock of birds that were black and green with \\nred markings on their wings. I’ve never seen birds like that before.\\nEverything in \\nthese mountains seems unusual,replied Eragon.Do you mind if I ride \\nyou awhile? I want to keep an eye on the Urgals.\\nOf course. \\nHe turned to \\nMurtagh. “The Varden are hidden at the end of this valley. If we hurry, we \\nmight get there before nightfall.”\\nMurtagh grunted, \\nhands on his hips. “How am I going to get out of here? I don’t see any valleys \\njoining this one, and the Urgals are going to hem us in pretty soon. I need an \\nescape route.”\\n“Don’t worry \\nabout it,” said Eragon impatiently. “This is a long valley; there’s sure to be \\nan exit further in.” He released Arya from Saphira and lifted the elf onto \\nSnowfire. “Watch Arya—I’m going to fly with Saphira. We’ll meet you up ahead.” \\nHe scrambled onto Saphira’s back and strapped himself onto her saddle.\\n“Be careful,” \\nMurtagh warned, his brow furrowed in thought, then clucked to the horses and \\nhurried back into the forest.\\nAs Saphira \\njumped toward the sky, Eragon said,Do you think you could fly up to one of \\nthose peaks? We might be able to spot our destination, as well as a passage for \\nMurtagh. I don’t want to listen to him griping through the entire valley.\\nWe can try,agreed Saphira,but \\nit will get much colder.\\nI’m dressed \\nwarmly.\\n\\nHold on, then!Saphira suddenly \\nswooped straight up, throwing him back in the saddle. Her wings flapped \\nstrongly, driving their weight upward. The valley shrank to a green line below \\nthem. The Beartooth River shimmered like braided silver where light struck it.\\nThey rose to the \\ncloud layer, and icy moisture saturated the air. A formless gray blanket \\nengulfed them, limiting their vision to an arm’s length. Eragon hoped they \\nwould not collide with anything in the murk. He stuck out a hand \\nexperimentally, swinging it through the air. Water condensed on it and ran down \\nhis arm, soaking his sleeve.\\nA blurred gray \\nmass fluttered past his head, and he glimpsed a dove, its wings pumping \\nfrantically. There was a white band around its leg. Saphira struck at the bird, \\ntongue lashing out, jaws gaping. The dove squawked as Saphira’s sharp teeth \\nsnapped together a hair’s breadth behind its tail feathers. Then it darted away \\nand disappeared into the haze, the frenzied thumping of its wings fading to \\nsilence.\\nWhen they breached \\nthe top of the clouds, Saphira’s scales were covered with thousands of water \\ndroplets that reflected tiny rainbows and shimmered with the blue of her \\nscales. Eragon shook himself, spraying water from his clothes, and shivered. He \\ncould no longer see the ground, only hills of clouds snaking between the \\nmountains.\\nThe trees on the \\nmountains gave way to thick glaciers, blue and white under the sun. The glare \\nfrom the snow forced Eragon to close his eyes. He tried to open them after a \\nminute, but the light dazzled him. Irritated, he stared into the crook of his \\narm.How can you stand it? he asked Saphira.\\nMy eyes are \\nstronger than yours,she \\nreplied.\\nIt was frigid. \\nThe water in Eragon’s hair froze, giving him a shiny helmet. His shirt and \\npants were hard shells around his limbs. Saphira’s scales became slick with \\nice; hoarfrost laced her wings. They had never flown this high before, yet the \\nmountaintops were still miles above them.\\nSaphira’s \\nflapping gradually slowed, and her breathing became labored. Eragon gasped and \\npanted; there didn’t seem to be enough air. Fighting back panic, he clutched \\nSaphira’s neck spikes for support.\\nWe . . . have to \\nget out of here,he \\nsaid. Red dots swam before his eyes.I can’t . . . breathe. Saphira \\nseemed not to hear him, so he repeated the message, louder this time. Again \\nthere was no response.She can’t hear me, he realized. He swayed, finding \\nit hard to think, then pounded on her side and shouted, “Take us down!”\\nThe effort made \\nhim lightheaded. His vision faded into swirling darkness.\\n\\xa0\\nHe regained \\nconsciousness as they emerged from the bottom of the clouds. His head was \\npounding.What happened? he asked, pushing himself upright and looking \\naround with confusion.\\nYou blacked out,answered \\nSaphira.\\nHe tried to run \\nhis fingers through his hair, but stopped when he felt icicles.Yes, I know \\nthat, but why didn’t you answer me?\\nMy brain was \\nconfused. Your words didn’t make any sense. When you lost consciousness, I knew \\nsomething was wrong and descended. I didn’t have to sink far before I realized \\nwhat had occurred.\\n\\nIt’s a good \\nthing you didn’t pass out as well,said Eragon with a nervous laugh. \\nSaphira only swished her tail. He looked wistfully at where the mountain peaks \\nwere now concealed by clouds.A pity we couldn’t stand upon one of those \\nsummits. . . . Well, now we know: we can only fly out of this valley the way we \\ncame in. Why did we run out of air? How can we have it down here, but not up \\nabove?\\nI don’t know, \\nbut I’ll never dare to fly so close to the sun again. We should remember this \\nexperience. The knowledge may be useful if we ever have to fight another Rider. \\nI hope that \\nnever happens,said \\nEragon.Let’s stay down below for now. I’ve had enough adventure for one day.\\nThey floated on \\nthe gentle air currents, drifting from one mountain to the next, until Eragon \\nsaw that the Urgal column had reached the valley’s mouth.What drives them to \\nsuch speed, and how can they bear to sustain it?\\nNow that we are \\ncloser to them,Saphira \\nsaid,I can see that these Urgals are bigger than the ones we’ve met before. \\nThey would stand chest and shoulders over a tall man. I don’t know what land \\nthey march from, but it must be a fierce place to produce such brutes.\\nEragon glared at \\nthe ground below—he could not see the detail that she did.If they keep to \\nthis pace, they’ll catch Murtagh before we find the Varden.\\nHave hope. The \\nforest may hamper their progress. . . . Would it be possible to stop them with \\nmagic?\\n\\nEragon shook his \\nhead.Stop them . . . no. There are too many. He thought of the thin \\nlayer of mist on the valley floor and grinned.But I might be able to delay \\nthem a bit. He closed his eyes, selected the words he needed, stared at the \\nmist, and then commanded, “Gath un reisa du rakr!”\\nThere was a \\ndisturbance below. From above, it looked as if the ground was flowing together \\nlike a great sluggish river. A leaden band of mist gathered in front of the \\nUrgals and thickened into an intimidating wall, dark as a thunderhead. The \\nUrgals hesitated before it, then continued forward like an unstoppable \\nbattering ram. The barrier swirled around them, concealing the lead ranks from \\nview.\\nThe drain on \\nEragon’s strength was sudden and massive, making his heart flutter like a dying \\nbird. He gasped, eyes rolling. He struggled to sever the magic’s hold on him—to \\nplug the breach through which his life streamed. With a savage growl he jerked \\naway from the magic and broke contact. Tendrils of magic snapped through his \\nmind like decapitated snakes, then reluctantly retreated from his \\nconsciousness, clutching at the dregs of his strength. The wall of mist \\ndissipated, and the fog sluggishly collapsed across the ground like a tower of \\nmud sliding apart. The Urgals had not been hindered at all.\\nEragon lay \\nlimply on Saphira, panting. Only now did he remember Brom saying, “Magic is \\naffected by distance, just like an arrow or a spear. If you try to lift or move \\nsomething a mile away, it’ll take more energy than if you were closer.”I \\nwon’t forget that again, he thought grimly.\\nYou shouldn’t \\nhave forgotten in the first place,Saphira inserted pointedly.First the \\ndirt at Gil’ead and now this. Weren’t you paying attention to anything Brom \\ntold you? You’ll kill yourself if you keep this up.\\nI paid \\nattention,he \\ninsisted, rubbing his chin. It’s just been a while, and I haven’t had an \\nopportunity to think back on it. I’ve never used magic at a distance, so how \\ncould I know it would be so difficult?\\nShe growled.Next \\nthing I know you’ll be trying to bring corpses back to life. Don’t forget what \\nBrom said about that, too.\\nI won’t,he said \\nimpatiently. Saphira dipped toward the ground, searching for Murtagh and the \\nhorses. Eragon would have helped her, but he barely had the energy to sit up.\\nSaphira settled \\nin a small field with a jolt, and Eragon was puzzled to see the horses stopped \\nand Murtagh kneeling, examining the ground. When Eragon did not dismount, \\nMurtagh hurried over and inquired, “What’s wrong?” He sounded angry, worried, \\nand tired at the same time.\\n“. . . I made a \\nmistake,” said Eragon truthfully. “The Urgals have entered the valley. I tried \\nto confuse them, but I forgot one of the rules of magic, and it cost me a great \\ndeal.”\\nScowling, \\nMurtagh jerked his thumb over his shoulder. “I just found some wolf tracks, but \\nthe footprints are as wide as both of my hands and an inch deep. There are \\nanimals around here that could be dangerous even to you, Saphira.” He turned to \\nher. “I know you can’t enter the forest, but could you circle above me and the \\nhorses? That should keep these beasts away. Otherwise there may only be enough \\nleft of me to roast in a thimble.”\\n“Humor, \\nMurtagh?” asked Eragon, a quick smile coming to his face. His muscles trembled, \\nmaking it hard for him to concentrate.\\n“Only on the \\ngallows.” Murtagh rubbed his eyes. “I can’t believe that the same Urgals have \\nbeen following us the whole time. They would have to be birds to catch up with \\nus.”\\n“Saphira said \\nthey’re larger than any we’ve seen,” remarked Eragon.\\nMurtagh cursed, \\nclenching the pommel of his sword. “That explains it! Saphira, if you’re right, \\nthen those are Kull, elite of the Urgals. I should have guessed that the \\nchieftain had been put in charge of them. They don’t ride because horses can’t \\ncarry their weight—not one of them is under eight feet tall—and they can run \\nfor days without sleep and still be ready for battle. It can take five men to \\nkill one. Kull never leave their caves except for war, so they must expect a \\ngreat slaughter if they are out in such force.”\\n“Can we stay \\nahead of them?”\\n“Who knows?” \\nsaid Murtagh. “They’re strong, determined, and large in numbers. It’s possible \\nthat we may have to face them. If that happens, I only hope that the Varden \\nhave men posted nearby who’ll help us. Despite our skill and Saphira, we can’t \\nhold off Kull.”\\nEragon swayed. \\n“Could you get me some bread? I need to eat.” Murtagh quickly brought him part \\nof a loaf. It was old and hard, but Eragon chewed on it gratefully. Murtagh \\nscanned the valley walls, worry in his eyes. Eragon knew he was searching for a \\nway out. “There’ll be one farther in.”\\n“Of course,” said \\nMurtagh with forced optimism, then slapped his thigh. “We must go.”\\n“How is Arya?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “The fever’s worse. She’s been tossing and turning. What do you \\nexpect? Her strength is failing. You should fly her to the Varden before the \\npoison does any more damage.”\\n“I won’t leave \\nyou behind,” insisted Eragon, gaining strength with each bite. “Not with the \\nUrgals so near.”\\nMurtagh shrugged \\nagain. “As you wish. But I’m warning you, she won’t live if you stay with me.”\\n“Don’t say \\nthat,” insisted Eragon, pushing himself upright in Saphira’s saddle. “Help me \\nsave her. We can still do it. Consider it a life for a life—atonement for \\nTorkenbrand’s death.”\\nMurtagh’s face \\ndarkened instantly. “It’s not a debt owed. You—” He stopped as a horn echoed \\nthrough the dark forest. “I’ll have more to say to you later,” he said shortly, \\nstomping to the horses. He grabbed their reins and trotted away, shooting an \\nangry glare at Eragon.\\nEragon closed \\nhis eyes as Saphira took flight. He wished that he could lie on a soft bed and \\nforget all their troubles. Saphira,he said at last, cupping his ears to \\nwarm them, what if we did take Arya to the Varden? Once she was safe, we \\ncould fly back to Murtagh and help him out of here.\\nThe Varden \\nwouldn’t let you,said \\nSaphira.For all they know, you might be returning to inform the Urgals of \\ntheir hiding place. We aren’t arriving under the best conditions to gain their \\ntrust. They’ll want to know why we’ve brought an entire company of Kull to \\ntheir very gates.\\nWe’ll just have to \\ntell them the truth and hope they believe us,said Eragon.\\nAnd what will we \\ndo if the Kull attack Murtagh? \\nFight them, of \\ncourse! I won’t let him and Arya be captured or killed,said Eragon \\nindignantly.\\nThere was a \\ntouch of sarcasm in her words.How noble. Oh, we would fell many of the \\nUrgals—you with magic and blade, whilst my weapons would be tooth and claw—but \\nit would be futile in the end. They are too numerous. . . . We cannot defeat \\nthem, only be defeated.\\nWhat, then?he demanded.I’ll \\nnot leave Arya or Murtagh to their mercy.\\nSaphira waved \\nher tail, the tip whistling loudly.I’m not asking you to. However, if we \\nattack first, we may gain the advantage.\\nHave you gone \\ncrazy? They’ll . . .Eragon’s \\nvoice trailed off as he thought about it.They won’t be able to do a thing, \\nhe concluded, surprised.\\nExactly,said Saphira.We \\ncan inflict lots of damage from a safe height.\\nLet’s drop rocks \\non them!proposed \\nEragon.That should scatter them.\\nIf their skulls \\naren’t thick enough to protect them.Saphira banked to the right and quickly \\ndescended to the Beartooth River. She grasped a mid-sized boulder with her \\nstrong talons while Eragon scooped up several fist-sized rocks. Laden with the \\nstones, Saphira glided on silent wings until they were over the Urgal host.Now! \\nshe exclaimed, releasing the boulder. There were muffled cracks as the missiles \\nplummeted through the forest top, smashing branches. A second later howls \\nechoed through the valley.\\nEragon smiled \\ntightly as he heard the Urgals scramble for cover.Let’s find more \\nammunition, he suggested, bending low over Saphira. She growled in \\nagreement and returned to the riverbed.\\nIt was hard \\nwork, but they were able to hinder the Urgals’ progress—though it was \\nimpossible to stop them altogether. The Urgals gained ground whenever Saphira \\nwent for stones. Despite that, their efforts allowed Murtagh to stay ahead of \\nthe advancing column.\\nThe valley \\ndarkened as the hours slipped by. Without the sun to provide warmth, the sharp \\nbite of frost crept into the air and the ground mist froze on the trees, \\ncoating them white. Night animals began to creep from their dens to peer from \\nshadowed hideouts at the strangers trespassing on their land.\\nEragon continued \\nto examine the mountainsides, searching for the waterfall that would signify \\nthe end of their journey. He was painfully aware that every passing minute \\nbrought Arya closer to death. “Faster, faster,” he muttered to himself, looking \\ndown at Murtagh. Before Saphira scooped up more rocks, he said,Let’s take a \\nrespite and check on Arya. The day is almost over, and I’m afraid her life is \\nmeasured in hours, if not minutes.\\nArya’s life is \\nin Fate’s hands now. You made your choice to stay with Murtagh; it’s too late \\nto change that, so stop agonizing over it. . . . You’re making my scales itch. \\nThe best thing we can do right now is to keep bombarding the Urgals.Eragon knew she \\nwas right, yet her words did nothing to calm his anxiety. He resumed his search \\nfor the waterfall, but whatever lay before them was hidden by a thick mountain \\nridge.\\nTrue darkness \\nbegan to fill the valley, settling over the trees and mountains like an inky \\ncloud. Even with her keen hearing and delicate sense of smell, Saphira could no \\nlonger locate the Urgals through the dense forest. There was no moon to help \\nthem; it would be hours before it rose above the mountains.\\nSaphira made a \\nlong, gentle left turn and glided around the mountain ridge. Eragon vaguely \\nsensed it pass by them, then squinted as he saw a faint white line ahead.Could \\nthat be the waterfall? he wondered.\\nHe looked at the \\nsky, which still held the afterglow of sunset. The mountains’ dark silhouettes \\ncurved together and formed a rough bowl that closed off the valley.The head \\nof the valley isn’t much farther! he exclaimed, pointing at the mountains.Do \\nyou think that the Varden know we’re coming? Maybe they’ll send men out to help \\nus.\\nI doubt they’ll \\nassist us until they know if we are friend or foe,Saphira said as \\nshe abruptly dropped toward the ground.I’m returning to Murtagh—we should \\nstay with him now. Since I can’t find the Urgals, they could sneak up on him \\nwithout us knowing.\\nEragon loosened \\nZar’roc in its sheath, wondering if he was strong enough to fight. Saphira \\nlanded to the left of the Beartooth River, then crouched expectantly. The \\nwaterfall rumbled in the distance.He comes, she said. Eragon strained \\nhis ears and caught the sound of pounding hooves. Murtagh ran out of the \\nforest, driving the horses before him. He saw them but did not slow.\\nEragon jumped \\noff Saphira, stumbling a bit as he matched Murtagh’s pace. Behind him Saphira \\nwent to the river so she could follow them without being hindered by the trees. \\nBefore Eragon could relay his news, Murtagh said, “I saw you dropping rocks \\nwith Saphira—ambitious. Have the Kull stopped or turned back?”\\n“They’re still \\nbehind us, but we’re almost to the head of the valley. How’s Arya?”\\n“She hasn’t \\ndied,” Murtagh said harshly. His breath came in short bursts. His next words \\nwere deceptively calm, like those of a man concealing a terrible passion. “Is there \\na valley or gorge ahead that I can leave through?”\\nApprehensive, \\nEragon tried to remember if he had seen any breaks in the mountains around \\nthem; he had not thought about Murtagh’s dilemma for a while. “It’s dark,” he \\nbegan evasively, dodging a low branch, “so I might have missed something, but . \\n. . no.”\\nMurtagh swore \\nexplosively and came to an abrupt stop, dragging on the horses’ reins until \\nthey halted as well. “Are you saying that the only place I can go is to the \\nVarden?”\\n“Yes, but keep \\nrunning. The Urgals are almost upon us!”\\n“No!” said \\nMurtagh angrily. He stabbed a finger at Eragon. “I warned you that I wouldn’t \\ngo to the Varden, but you went ahead and trapped me between a hammer and an \\nanvil! You’re the one with the elf’s memories. Why didn’t you tell me this was \\na dead end?”\\nEragon bristled \\nat the barrage and retorted, “All I knew was where we had to go, not what lay \\nin between. Don’t blame me for choosing to come.”\\nMurtagh’s breath \\nhissed between his teeth as he furiously spun away. All Eragon could see of him \\nwas a motionless, bowed figure. His own shoulders were tense, and a vein \\nthrobbed on the side of his neck. He put his hands on his hips, impatience \\nrising.\\nWhy have you \\nstopped?asked \\nSaphira, alarmed.\\nDon’t distract \\nme.“What’s \\nyour quarrel with the Varden? It can’t be so terrible that you must keep it \\nhidden even now. Would you rather fight the Kull than reveal it? How many times \\nwill we go through this before you trust me?”\\nThere was a long \\nsilence.\\nThe Urgals!reminded Saphira \\nurgently.\\nI know,said Eragon, \\npushing back his temper.But we have to resolve this.\\nQuickly, \\nquickly.\\n\\n“Murtagh,” said \\nEragon earnestly, “unless you wish to die, we must go to the Varden. Don’t let \\nme walk into their arms without knowing how they will react to you. It’s going \\nto be dangerous enough without unnecessary surprises.”\\nFinally Murtagh \\nturned to Eragon. His breathing was hard and fast, like that of a cornered \\nwolf. He paused, then said with a tortured voice, “You have a right to know. I \\n. . . I am the son of Morzan, first and last of the Forsworn.”\\nT HEHORNS OFADILEMMA\\nEragon was \\nspeechless. Disbelief roared through his mind as he tried to reject Murtagh’s \\nwords.The Forsworn never had any children, least of all Morzan. Morzan! The \\nman who betrayed the Riders to Galbatorix and remained the king’s favorite \\nservant for the rest of his life. Could it be true?\\nSaphira’s own \\nshock reached him a second later. She crashed through trees and brush as she \\nbarreled from the river to his side, fangs bared, tail raised threateningly.Be \\nready for anything, she warned.He may be able to use magic.\\n“You are his \\nheir?” asked Eragon, surreptitiously reaching for Zar’roc.What could he want \\nwith me? Is he really working for the king?\\n“I didn’t choose \\nthis!” cried Murtagh, anguish twisting his face. He ripped at his clothes with \\na desperate air, tearing off his tunic and shirt to bare his torso. “Look!” he \\npleaded, and turned his back to Eragon.\\nUnsure, Eragon \\nleaned forward, straining his eyes in the darkness. There, against Murtagh’s \\ntanned and muscled skin, was a knotted white scar that stretched from his right \\nshoulder to his left hip—a testament to some terrible agony.\\n“See that?” \\ndemanded Murtagh bitterly. He talked quickly now, as if relieved to have his secret \\nfinally revealed. “I was only three when I got it. During one of his many \\ndrunken rages, Morzan threw his sword at me as I ran by. My back was laid open \\nby the very sword you now carry—the only thing I expected to receive as \\ninheritance, until Brom stole it from my father’s corpse. I was lucky, I \\nsuppose—there was a healer nearby who kept me from dying. You must understand, \\nI don’t love the Empire or the king. I have no allegiance to them, nor do I \\nmean you harm!” His pleas were almost frantic.\\nEragon uneasily \\nlifted his hand from Zar’roc’s pommel. “Then your father,” he said in a \\nfaltering voice, “was killed by . . .”\\n“Yes, Brom,” \\nsaid Murtagh. He pulled his tunic back on with a detached air.\\nA horn rang out \\nbehind them, prompting Eragon to cry, “Come, run with me.” Murtagh shook the \\nhorses’ reins and forced them into a tired trot, eyes fixed straight ahead, \\nwhile Arya bounced limply in Snowfire’s saddle. Saphira stayed by Eragon’s \\nside, easily keeping pace with her long legs.You could walk unhindered in \\nthe riverbed, he said as she was forced to smash through a dense web of \\nbranches.\\nI’ll not leave \\nyou with him.\\n\\nEragon was glad \\nfor her protection.Morzan’s son! He said between strides, “Your tale is \\nhard to believe. How do I know you aren’t lying?”\\n“Why would I \\nlie?”\\n“You could be—”\\nMurtagh \\ninterrupted him quickly. “I can’t prove anything to you now. Keep your doubts \\nuntil we reach the Varden. They’ll recognize me quickly enough.”\\n“I must know,” \\npressed Eragon. “Do you serve the Empire?”\\n“No. And if I did, \\nwhat would I accomplish by traveling with you? If I were trying to capture or \\nkill you, I would have left you in prison.” Murtagh stumbled as he jumped over \\na fallen log.\\n“You could be \\nleading the Urgals to the Varden.”\\n“Then,” said \\nMurtagh shortly, “why am I still with you? I know where the Varden are now. \\nWhat reason could I have for delivering myself to them? If I were going to \\nattack them, I’d turn around and join the Urgals.”\\n“Maybe you’re an \\nassassin,” stated Eragon flatly.\\n“Maybe. You \\ncan’t really know, can you?”\\nSaphira?Eragon asked \\nsimply.\\nHer tail swished \\nover his head.If he wanted to harm you, he could have done it long ago.\\nA branch whipped \\nEragon’s neck, causing a line of blood to appear on his skin. The waterfall was \\ngrowing louder.I want you to watch Murtagh closely when we get to the \\nVarden. He may do something foolish, and I don’t want him killed by accident.\\nI’ll do my best,she said as she \\nshouldered her way between two trees, scraping off slabs of bark. The horn \\nsounded behind them again. Eragon glanced over his shoulder, expecting Urgals \\nto rush out of the darkness. The waterfall throbbed dully ahead of them, \\ndrowning out the sounds of the night.\\nThe forest \\nended, and Murtagh pulled the horses to a stop. They were on a pebble beach directly \\nto the left of the mouth of the Beartooth River. The deep lake Kóstha-mérna \\nfilled the valley, blocking their way. The water gleamed with flickering \\nstarlight. The mountain walls restricted passage around Kóstha-mérna to a thin \\nstrip of shore on either side of the lake, both no more than a few steps wide. \\nAt the lake’s far end, a broad sheet of water tumbled down a black cliff into \\nboiling mounds of froth.\\n“Do we go to the \\nfalls?” asked Murtagh tightly.\\n“Yes.” Eragon \\ntook the lead and picked his way along the lake’s left side. The pebbles \\nunderfoot were damp and slime covered. There was barely enough room for Saphira \\nbetween the sheer valley wall and the lake; she had to walk with two feet in \\nthe water.\\nThey were \\nhalfway to the waterfall when Murtagh warned, “Urgals!”\\nEragon whirled \\naround, rocks spraying from under his heel. By the shore of Kóstha-mérna, where \\nthey had been only minutes before, hulking figures streamed out of the forest. \\nThe Urgals massed before the lake. One of them gestured at Saphira; guttural \\nwords drifted over the water. Immediately the horde split and started around \\nboth sides of the lake, leaving Eragon and Murtagh without an escape route. The \\nnarrow shore forced the bulky Kull to march single file.\\n“Run!” barked \\nMurtagh, drawing his sword and slapping the horses on their flanks. Saphira \\ntook off without warning and wheeled back toward the Urgals.\\n“No!” cried \\nEragon, shouting with his mind,Come back! but she continued, heedless to \\nhis pleas. With an agonizing effort, he tore his gaze from her and plunged \\nforward, wrenching Zar’roc from its sheath.\\nSaphira dived at \\nthe Urgals, bellowing fiercely. They tried to scatter but were trapped against \\nthe mountainside. She caught a Kull between her talons and carried the \\nscreaming creature aloft, tearing at him with her fangs. The silent body \\ncrashed into the lake a moment later, an arm and a leg missing.\\nThe Kull \\ncontinued around Kóstha-mérna undeterred. With smoke streaming from her \\nnostrils, Saphira dived at them again. She twisted and rolled as a cloud of \\nblack arrows shot toward her. Most of the darts glanced off her scaled sides, \\nleaving no more than bruises, but she roared as the rest pierced her wings.\\nEragon’s arms \\ntwinged with sympathetic pain, and he had to restrain himself from rushing to \\nher defense. Fear flooded his veins as he saw the line of Urgals closing in on \\nthem. He tried to run faster, but his muscles were too tired, the rocks too \\nslippery.\\nThen, with a \\nloud splash, Saphira plunged into Kóstha-mérna. She submerged completely, \\nsending ripples across the lake. The Urgals nervously eyed the dark water \\nlapping their feet. One growled something indecipherable and jabbed his spear \\nat the lake.\\nThe water \\nexploded as Saphira’s head shot out of the depths. Her jaws closed on the \\nspear, breaking it like a twig as she tore it out of the Kull’s hands with a \\nvicious twist. Before she could seize the Urgal himself, his companions thrust \\nat her with their spears, bloodying her nose.\\nSaphira jerked \\nback and hissed angrily, beating the water with her tail. Keeping his spear \\npointed at her, the lead Kull tried to edge past, but halted when she snapped \\nat his legs. The string of Urgals was forced to stop as she held him at bay. \\nMeanwhile, the Kull on the other side of the lake still hurried toward the \\nfalls.\\nI’ve trapped \\nthem,she \\ntold Eragon tersely,but hurry—I cannot hold them long. Archers on the \\nshore were already taking aim at her. Eragon concentrated on going faster, but \\na rock gave under his boot and he pitched forward. Murtagh’s strong arm kept \\nhim on his feet, and clasping each other’s forearms, they urged the horses \\nforward with shouts.\\nThey were almost \\nto the waterfall. The noise was overwhelming, like an avalanche. A white wall \\nof water gushed down the cliff, pounding the rocks below with a fury that sent \\nmist spraying through the air to run down their faces. Four yards from the \\nthunderous curtain, the beach widened, giving them room to maneuver.\\nSaphira roared \\nas an Urgal spear grazed her haunch, then retreated underwater. With her \\nwithdrawal the Kull rushed forward with long strides. They were only a few \\nhundred feet away. “What do we do now?” Murtagh demanded coldly.\\n“I don’t know. \\nLet me think!” cried Eragon, searching Arya’s memories for her final \\ninstructions. He scanned the ground until he found a rock the size of an apple, \\ngrabbed it, then pounded on the cliff next to the falls, shouting, “Aí varden \\nabr du Shur’tugals gata vanta!”\\nNothing \\nhappened.\\nHe tried again, \\nshouting louder than before, but only succeeded in bruising his hand. He turned \\nin despair to Murtagh. “We’re trap—” His words were cut off as Saphira leapt \\nout of the lake, dousing them with icy water. She landed on the beach and \\ncrouched, ready to fight.\\nThe horses \\nbackpedaled wildly, trying to bolt. Eragon reached out with his mind to steady \\nthem.Behind you! cried Saphira. He turned and glimpsed the lead Urgal \\nrunning at him, heavy spear raised. Up close a Kull was as tall as a small \\ngiant, with legs and arms as thick as tree trunks.\\nMurtagh drew back \\nhis arm and threw his sword with incredible speed. The long weapon revolved \\nonce, then struck the Kull point first in the chest with a dull crunch. The \\nhuge Urgal toppled to the ground with a strangled gurgle. Before another Kull \\ncould attack, Murtagh dashed forward and yanked his sword out of the body.\\nEragon raised \\nhis palm, shouting, “Jierda theirra kalfis!” Sharp cracks resounded off the \\ncliff. Twenty of the charging Urgals fell into Kóstha-mérna, howling and \\nclutching their legs where shards of bone protruded. Without breaking stride, \\nthe rest of the Urgals advanced over their fallen companions. Eragon struggled \\nagainst his weariness, putting a hand on Saphira for support.\\nA flight of \\narrows, impossible to see in the darkness, brushed past them and clattered \\nagainst the cliff. Eragon and Murtagh ducked, covering their heads. With a \\nsmall growl, Saphira jumped over them so that her armored sides shielded them \\nand the horses. A chorus of clinks sounded as a second volley of arrows bounced \\noff her scales.\\n“What now?” \\nshouted Murtagh. There was still no opening in the cliff. “We can’t stay here!”\\nEragon heard \\nSaphira snarl as an arrow caught the edge of her wing, tearing the thin \\nmembrane. He looked around wildly, trying to understand why Arya’s instructions \\nhad not worked. “I don’t know! This is where we’re supposed to be!”\\n“Why don’t you \\nask the elf to make sure?” demanded Murtagh. He dropped his sword, snatched his \\nbow from Tornac’s saddlebags, and with a swift motion loosed an arrow from \\nbetween the spikes on Saphira’s back. A moment later an Urgal toppled into the \\nwater.\\n“Now? She’s \\nbarely alive! How’s she going to find the energy to say anything?”\\n“I don’tknow, \\n” shouted Murtagh, “but you’d better think ofsomething because we can’t \\nstave off an entire army!”\\nEragon,growled Saphira \\nurgently.\\nWhat! \\nWe’re on the \\nwrong side of the lake! I’ve seen Arya’s memories through you, and I just \\nrealized that this isn’t the right place.She tucked her head against her \\nbreast as another flight of arrows sped toward them. Her tail flicked in pain \\nas they struck her.I can’t keep this up! They’re tearing me to pieces!\\nEragon slammed \\nZar’roc back into its sheath and exclaimed, “The Varden are on the other side \\nof the lake. We have to go through the waterfall!” He noted with dread that the \\nUrgals across Kóstha-mérna were almost to the falls.\\nMurtagh’s eyes \\nshot toward the violent deluge blocking their way. “We’ll never get the horses \\nthrough there, even if we can hold our own footing.”\\n“I’ll convince \\nthem to follow us,” snapped Eragon. “And Saphira can carry Arya.” The Urgals’ \\ncries and bellows made Snowfire snort angrily. The elf lolled on his back, \\noblivious to the danger.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “It’s better than being hacked to death.” He swiftly cut Arya loose \\nfrom Snowfire’s saddle, and Eragon caught the elf as she slid to the ground.\\nI’m ready,said Saphira, \\nrising into a half-crouch. The approaching Urgals hesitated, unsure of her \\nintentions.\\n“Now!” cried \\nEragon. He and Murtagh heaved Arya onto Saphira, then secured her legs in the \\nsaddle’s straps. The second they were finished, Saphira swept up her wings and \\nsoared over the lake. The Urgals behind her howled as they saw her escaping. \\nArrows clattered off her belly. The Kull on the other shore redoubled their \\npace so as to attain the waterfall before she landed.\\nEragon reached \\nout with his mind to force himself into the frightened thoughts of the horses. \\nUsing the ancient language, he told them that unless they swam through the \\nwaterfall, they would be killed and eaten by the Urgals. Though they did not \\nunderstand everything he said, the meaning of his words was unmistakable.\\nSnowfire and \\nTornac tossed their heads, then dashed into the thundering downpour, whinnying \\nas it struck their backs. They floundered, struggling to stay above water. \\nMurtagh sheathed his sword and jumped after them; his head disappeared under a \\nfroth of bubbles before he bobbed up, sputtering.\\nThe Urgals were \\nright behind Eragon; he could hear their feet crunching on the gravel. With a \\nfierce war cry he leapt after Murtagh, closing his eyes a second before the \\ncold water pummeled him.\\nThe tremendous \\nweight of the waterfall slammed down on his shoulders with backbreaking force. \\nThe water’s mindless roar filled his ears. He was driven to the bottom, where \\nhis knees gouged the rocky lakebed. He kicked off with all his strength and \\nshot partway out of the water. Before he could take a gulp of air, the cascade \\nrammed him back underwater.\\nAll he could see \\nwas a white blur as foam billowed around him. He frantically tried to surface \\nand relieve his burning lungs, but he only rose a few feet before the deluge \\nhalted his ascent. He panicked, thrashing his arms and legs, fighting the \\nwater. Weighed down by Zar’roc and his drenched clothes, he sank back to the \\nlakebed, unable to speak the ancient words that could save him.\\nSuddenly a \\nstrong hand grasped the back of his tunic and dragged him through the water. \\nHis rescuer sliced through the lake with quick, short strokes; Eragon hoped it \\nwas Murtagh, not an Urgal. They surfaced and stumbled onto the pebble beach. \\nEragon was trembling violently; his entire body shivered in bursts.\\nSounds of combat \\nerupted to his right, and he whirled toward them, expecting an Urgal attack. \\nThe monsters on the opposite shore—where he had stood only moments before—fell \\nbeneath a withering hail of arrows from crevasses that pockmarked the cliff. \\nScores of Urgals already floated belly up in the water, riddled with shafts. \\nThe ones on Eragon’s shore were similarly engaged. Neither group could retreat \\nfrom their exposed positions, for rows of warriors had somehow appeared behind \\nthem, where the lake met the mountainsides. All that prevented the nearest Kull \\nfrom rushing Eragon was the steady rain of arrows—the unseen archers seemed \\ndetermined to keep the Urgals at bay.\\nA gruff voice \\nnext to Eragon said, “Akh Guntéraz dorzâda! What were they thinking? You would \\nhave drowned!” Eragon jerked with surprise. It was not Murtagh standing by him \\nbut a diminutive man no taller than his elbow.\\nThe dwarf was \\nbusy wringing water out of his long braided beard. His chest was stocky, and he \\nwore a chain-mail jacket cut off at the shoulders to reveal muscular arms. A \\nwar ax hung from a wide leather belt strapped around his waist. An iron-bound \\noxhide cap, bearing the symbol of a hammer surrounded by twelve stars, sat \\nfirmly on his head. Even with the cap, he barely topped four feet. He looked \\nlongingly at the fighting and said, “Barzul, but I wish I could join them!”\\nA dwarf!Eragon drew \\nZar’roc and looked for Saphira and Murtagh. Two twelve-foot-thick stone doors \\nhad opened in the cliff, revealing a broad tunnel nearly thirty feet tall that \\nburrowed its way into the mysterious depths of the mountain. A line of \\nflameless lamps filled the passageway with a pale sapphire light that spilled \\nout onto the lake.\\nSaphira and \\nMurtagh stood before the tunnel, surrounded by a grim mixture of men and \\ndwarves. At Murtagh’s elbow was a bald, beardless man dressed in purple and \\ngold robes. He was taller than all the other humans—and he was holding a dagger \\nto Murtagh’s throat.\\nEragon reached \\nfor his power, but the robed man said in a sharp, dangerous voice, “Stop! If \\nyou use magic, I’ll kill your lovely friend here, who was so kind as to mention \\nyou’re a Rider. Don’t think I won’t know if you’re drawing upon it. You can’t \\nhide anything from me.” Eragon tried to speak, but the man snarled and pressed \\nthe dagger harder against Murtagh’s throat. “None of that! If you say or do \\nanything I don’t tell you to, he will die. Now, everyone inside.” He backed \\ninto the tunnel, pulling Murtagh with him and keeping his eyes on Eragon.\\nSaphira, what \\nshould I do?Eragon \\nasked quickly as the men and dwarves followed Murtagh’s captor, leading the \\nhorses along with them.\\nGo with them,she counseled,and \\nhope that we live. She entered the tunnel herself, eliciting nervous \\nglances from those around her. Reluctantly, Eragon followed her, aware that the \\nwarriors’ eyes were upon him. His rescuer, the dwarf, walked alongside him with \\na hand on the haft of his war ax.\\nUtterly \\nexhausted, Eragon staggered into the mountain. The stone doors swung shut \\nbehind them with only a whisper of sound. He looked back and saw a seamless \\nwall where the opening had been. They were trapped inside. But were they any \\nsafer?\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 43': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nH UNTING FORANSWERS\\n“This way,” \\nsnapped the bald man. He stepped back, keeping the dagger pressed under \\nMurtagh’s chin, then wheeled to the right, disappearing through an arched \\ndoorway. The warriors cautiously followed him, their attention centered on \\nEragon and Saphira. The horses were led into a different tunnel.\\nDazed by the \\nturn of events, Eragon started after Murtagh. He glanced at Saphira to confirm \\nthat Arya was still tied to her back.She has to get the antidote! he \\nthought frantically, knowing that even then the Skilna Bragh was fulfilling its \\ndeadly purpose within her flesh.\\nHe hurried \\nthrough the arched doorway and down a narrow corridor after the bald man. The \\nwarriors kept their weapons pointed at him. They swept past a sculpture of a \\npeculiar animal with thick quills. The corridor curved sharply to the left, \\nthen to the right. A door opened and they entered a bare room large enough for \\nSaphira to move around with ease. There was a hollow boom as the door closed, \\nfollowed by a loud scrape as a bolt was secured on the outside.\\nEragon slowly \\nexamined his surroundings, Zar’roc tight in his hand. The walls, floor, and \\nceiling were made of polished white marble that reflected a ghost image of \\neveryone, like a mirror of veined milk. One of the unusual lanterns hung in \\neach corner. “There’s an injured—” he began, but a sharp gesture from the bald \\nman cut him off.\\n“Do not speak! \\nIt must wait until you have been tested.” He shoved Murtagh over to one of the \\nwarriors, who pressed a sword against Murtagh’s neck. The bald man clasped his \\nhands together softly. “Remove your weapons and slide them to me.” A dwarf \\nunbuckled Murtagh’s sword and dropped it on the floor with a clank.\\nLoath to be \\nparted with Zar’roc, Eragon unfastened the sheath and set it and the blade on \\nthe floor. He placed his bow and quiver next to them, then pushed the pile \\ntoward the warriors. “Now step away from your dragon and slowly approach me,” \\ncommanded the bald man.\\nPuzzled, Eragon \\nmoved forward. When they were a yard apart, the man said, “Stop there! Now \\nremove the defenses from around your mind and prepare to let me inspect your \\nthoughts and memories. If you try to hide anything from me, I will take what I \\nwant by force . . . which would drive you mad. If you don’t submit, your \\ncompanion will be killed.”\\n“Why?” asked \\nEragon, aghast.\\n“To be sure you \\naren’t in Galbatorix’s service and to understand why hundreds of Urgals are \\nbanging on our front door,” growled the bald man. His close-set eyes shifted \\nfrom point to point with cunning speed. “No one may enter Farthen Dûr without \\nbeing tested.”\\n“There isn’t \\ntime. We need a healer!” protested Eragon.\\n“Silence!” \\nroared the man, pressing down his robe with thin fingers. “Until you are \\nexamined, your words are meaningless!”\\n“But she’s \\ndying!” retorted Eragon angrily, pointing at Arya. They were in a precarious \\nposition, but he would let nothing else happen until Arya was cared for.\\n“It will have to \\nwait! No one will leave this room until we have discovered the truth of this matter. \\nUnless you wish—”\\nThe dwarf who \\nhad saved Eragon from the lake jumped forward. “Are you blind, Egraz Carn? \\nCan’t you see that’s an elf on the dragon? We cannot keep her here if she’s in \\ndanger. Ajihad and the king will have our heads if she’s allowed to die!”\\nThe man’s eyes \\ntightened with anger. After a moment he relaxed and said smoothly, “Of course, \\nOrik, we wouldn’t want that to happen.” He snapped his fingers and pointed at \\nArya. “Remove her from the dragon.” Two human warriors sheathed their swords \\nand hesitantly approached Saphira, who watched them steadily. “Quickly, \\nquickly!”\\nThe men \\nunstrapped Arya from the saddle and lowered the elf to the floor. One of the \\nmen inspected her face, then said sharply, “It’s the dragon-egg courier, Arya!”\\n“What?” \\nexclaimed the bald man. The dwarf Orik’s eyes widened with astonishment. The \\nbald man fixed his steely gaze on Eragon and said flatly, “You have much \\nexplaining to do.”\\nEragon returned \\nthe intense stare with all the determination he could muster. “She was poisoned \\nwith the Skilna Bragh while in prison. Only Túnivor’s Nectar can save her now.”\\nThe bald man’s \\nface became inscrutable. He stood motionless, except for his lips, which \\ntwitched occasionally. “Very well. Take her to the healers, and tell them what \\nshe needs. Guard her until the ceremony is completed. I will have new orders \\nfor you by then.” The warriors nodded curtly and carried Arya out of the room. \\nEragon watched them go, wishing that he could accompany her. His attention \\nsnapped back to the bald man as he said, “Enough of this, we have wasted too \\nmuch time already. Prepare to be examined.”\\nEragon did not \\nwant this hairless threatening man inside his mind, laying bare his every \\nthought and feeling, but he knew that resistance would be useless. The air was \\nstrained. Murtagh’s gaze burned into his forehead. Finally he bowed his head. \\n“I am ready.”\\n“Good, then—”\\nHe was \\ninterrupted as Orik said abruptly, “You’d better not harm him, Egraz Carn, else \\nthe king will have words for you.”\\nThe bald man \\nlooked at him irritably, then faced Eragon with a small smile. “Only if he \\nresists.” He bowed his head and chanted several inaudible words.\\nEragon gasped \\nwith pain and shock as a mental probe clawed its way into his mind. His eyes \\nrolled up into his head, and he automatically began throwing up barriers around \\nhis consciousness. The attack was incredibly powerful.\\nDon’t do that!cried Saphira. \\nHer thoughts joined his, filling him with strength.You’re putting Murtagh at \\nrisk! Eragon faltered, gritted his teeth, then forced himself to remove his \\nshielding, exposing himself to the ravening probe. Disappointment emanated from \\nthe bald man. His battering intensified. The force coming from his mind felt \\ndecayed and unwholesome; there was something profoundly wrong about it.\\nHe wants me to \\nfight him!cried \\nEragon as a fresh wave of pain racked him. A second later it subsided, only to \\nbe replaced by another. Saphira did her best to suppress it, but even she could \\nnot block it entirely.\\nGive him what he \\nwants,she \\nsaid quickly,but protect everything else. I’ll help you. His strength is no \\nmatch for mine; I’m already shielding our words from him.\\nThen why does it \\nstill hurt?\\n\\nThe pain comes \\nfrom you.\\n\\nEragon winced as \\nthe probe dug in farther, hunting for information, like a nail being driven \\nthrough his skull. The bald man roughly seized his childhood memories and began \\nsifting through them.He doesn’t need those—get him out of there! growled \\nEragon angrily.\\nI can’t, not \\nwithout endangering you,said Saphira.I can conceal things from his view, \\nbut it must be done before he reaches them. Think quickly, and tell me what you \\nwant hidden!\\nEragon tried to \\nconcentrate through the pain. He raced through his memories, starting from when \\nhe had found Saphira’s egg. He hid sections of his discussions with Brom, \\nincluding all the ancient words he had been taught. Their travels through \\nPalancar Valley, Yazuac, Daret, and Teirm he left mostly untouched. But he had \\nSaphira conceal everything he remembered of Angela’s fortunetelling and \\nSolembum. He skipped from their burglary at Teirm, to Brom’s death, to his \\nimprisonment in Gil’ead, and lastly to Murtagh’s revelation of his true \\nidentity.\\nEragon wanted to \\nhide that as well, but Saphira balked.The Varden have a right to know who \\nthey shelter under their roof, especially if it’s a son of the Forsworn!\\nJust do it,he said tightly, \\nfighting another wave of agony.I won’t be the one to unmask him, at least \\nnot to this man.\\nIt’ll be \\ndiscovered as soon as Murtagh is scanned,warned Saphira sharply.\\nJust do it. \\nWith the most \\nimportant information hidden, there was nothing else for Eragon to do but wait \\nfor the bald man to finish his inspection. It was like sitting still while his \\nfingernails were extracted with rusty tongs. His entire body was rigid, jaw \\nlocked tightly. Heat radiated from his skin, and a line of sweat rolled down \\nhis neck. He was acutely aware of each second as the long minutes crept by.\\nThe bald man \\nwound through his experiences sluggishly, like a thorny vine pushing its way \\ntoward the sunlight. He paid keen attention to many things Eragon considered \\nirrelevant, such as his mother, Selena, and seemed to linger on purpose so as \\nto prolong the suffering. He spent a long time examining Eragon’s recollections \\nof the Ra’zac, and then later the Shade. It was not until his adventures had \\nbeen exhaustively analyzed that the bald man began to withdraw from Eragon’s \\nmind.\\nThe probe was \\nextracted like a splinter being removed. Eragon shuddered, swayed, then fell \\ntoward the floor. Strong arms caught him at the last second, lowering him to \\nthe cool marble. He heard Orik exclaim from behind him, “You went too far! He \\nwasn’t strong enough for this.”\\n“He’ll live. \\nThat’s all that is needed,” answered the bald man curtly.\\nThere was an \\nangry grunt. “What did you find?”\\nSilence.\\n“Well, is he to \\nbe trusted or not?”\\nThe words came \\nreluctantly. “He . . . is not your enemy.” There were audible sighs of relief \\nthroughout the room.\\nEragon’s eyes \\nfluttered open. He gingerly pushed himself upright. “Easy now,” said Orik, \\nwrapping a thick arm around him and helping him to his feet. Eragon wove \\nunsteadily, glaring at the bald man. A low growl rumbled in Saphira’s throat.\\nThe bald man \\nignored them. He turned to Murtagh, who was still being held at sword point. \\n“It’s your turn now.”\\nMurtagh \\nstiffened and shook his head. The sword cut his neck slightly. Blood dripped \\ndown his skin. “No.”\\n“You will not be \\nprotected here if you refuse.”\\n“Eragon has been \\ndeclared trustworthy, so you cannot threaten to kill him to influence me. Since \\nyou can’t do that, nothing you say or do will convince me to open my mind.”\\nSneering, the \\nbald man cocked what would have been an eyebrow, if he had any. “What of your \\nown life? I can still threaten that.”\\n“It won’t do any \\ngood,” said Murtagh stonily and with such conviction that it was impossible to \\ndoubt his word.\\nThe bald man’s \\nbreath exploded angrily. “You don’t have a choice!” He stepped forward and \\nplaced his palm on Murtagh’s brow, clenching his hand to hold him in place. \\nMurtagh stiffened, face growing as hard as iron, fists clenched, neck muscles \\nbulging. He was obviously fighting the attack with all his strength. The bald \\nman bared his teeth with fury and frustration at the resistance; his fingers \\ndug mercilessly into Murtagh.\\nEragon winced in \\nsympathy, knowing the battle that raged between them.Can’t you help him? \\nhe asked Saphira.\\nNo,she said softly.He \\nwill allow no one into his mind.\\nOrik scowled \\ndarkly as he watched the combatants. “Ilf carnz orodüm,” he muttered, then \\nleapt forward and cried, “That is enough!” He grabbed the bald man’s arm and \\ntore him away from Murtagh with strength disproportional to his size.\\nThe bald man \\nstumbled back, then turned on Orik furiously. “How dare you!” he shouted. “You \\nquestioned my leadership, opened the gates without permission, and now this! \\nYou’ve shown nothing but insolence and treachery. Do you think your king will \\nprotect you now?”\\nOrik bristled. \\n“You would have let them die! If I had waited any longer, the Urgals would have \\nkilled them.” He pointed at Murtagh, whose breath came in great heaves. “We \\ndon’t have any right to torture him for information! Ajihad won’t sanction it. \\nNot after you’ve examined the Rider and found him free of fault.And they’ve \\nbrought us Arya.”\\n“Would you allow \\nhim to enter unchallenged? Are you so great a fool as to put us all at risk?” \\ndemanded the bald man. His eyes were feral with loosely chained rage; he looked \\nready to tear the dwarf into pieces.\\n“Can he use \\nmagic?”\\n“That is—”\\n“Can he use \\nmagic?” roared Orik, his deep voice echoing in the room. The bald man’s face \\nsuddenly grew expressionless. He clasped his hands behind his back.\\n“No.”\\n“Then what do \\nyou fear? It’s impossible for him to escape, and he can’t work any devilry with \\nall of us here, especially if your powers are as great as you say. But don’t \\nlisten to me; ask Ajihad what he wants done.”\\nThe bald man \\nstared at Orik for a moment, his face indecipherable, then looked at the \\nceiling and closed his eyes. A peculiar stiffness set into his shoulders while \\nhis lips moved soundlessly. An intense frown wrinkled the pale skin above his \\neyes, and his fingers clenched, as if they were throttling an invisible enemy. \\nFor several minutes he stood thus, wrapped in silent communication.\\nWhen his eyes \\nopened, he ignored Orik and snapped at the warriors, “Leave, now!” As they \\nfiled through the doorway, he addressed Eragon coldly, “Because I was unable to \\ncomplete my examination, you and . . . your friend will remain here for the \\nnight. He will be killed if he attempts to leave.” With those words he turned \\non his heel and stalked out of the room, pale scalp gleaming in the lantern \\nlight.\\n“Thank you,” \\nwhispered Eragon to Orik.\\nThe dwarf \\ngrunted. “I’ll make sure some food is brought.” He muttered a string of words \\nunder his breath, then left, shaking his head. The bolt was secured once again \\non the outside of the door.\\nEragon sat, \\nfeeling strangely dreamy from the day’s excitement and their forced march. His \\neyelids were heavy. Saphira settled next to him.We must be careful. It seems \\nwe have as many enemies here as we did in the Empire. He nodded, too tired \\nto talk.\\nMurtagh, eyes \\nglazed and empty, leaned against the far wall and slid to the shiny floor. He \\nheld his sleeve against the cut on his neck to stop the bleeding. “Are you all \\nright?” asked Eragon. Murtagh nodded jerkily. “Did he get anything from you?”\\n“No.”\\n“How were you \\nable to keep him out? He’s so strong.”\\n“I’ve . . . I’ve \\nbeen well trained.” There was a bitter note to his voice.\\nSilence \\nenshrouded them. Eragon’s gaze drifted to one of the lanterns hanging in a \\ncorner. His thoughts meandered until he abruptly said, “I didn’t let them know \\nwho you are.”\\nMurtagh looked \\nrelieved. He bowed his head. “Thank you for not betraying me.”\\n“They didn’t \\nrecognize you.”\\n“No.”\\n“And you still \\nsay that you are Morzan’s son?”\\n“Yes,” he \\nsighed.\\nEragon started \\nto speak, but stopped when he felt hot liquid splash onto his hand. He looked \\ndown and was startled to see a drop of dark blood roll off his skin. It had \\nfallen from Saphira’s wing.I forgot. You’re injured! he exclaimed, \\ngetting up with an effort.I’d better heal you.\\nBe careful. It’s \\neasy to make mistakes when you’re this tired. \\nI know.Saphira unfolded \\none of her wings and lowered it to the floor. Murtagh watched as Eragon ran his \\nhands over the warm blue membrane, saying, “Waíse heill,” whenever he found an \\narrow hole. Luckily, all the wounds were relatively easy to heal, even those on \\nher nose.\\nTask completed, \\nEragon slumped against Saphira, breathing hard. He could feel her great heart \\nbeating with the steady throb of life. “I hope they bring food soon,” said \\nMurtagh.\\nEragon shrugged; \\nhe was too exhausted to be hungry. He crossed his arms, missing Zar’roc’s \\nweight by his side. “Why are you here?”\\n“What?”\\n“If you really \\nare Morzan’s son, Galbatorix wouldn’t let you wander around Alagaësia freely. \\nHow is it that you managed to find the Ra’zac by yourself? Why is it I’ve never \\nheard of any of the Forsworn having children? And what are you doing here?” His \\nvoice rose to a near shout at the end.\\nMurtagh ran his \\nhands over his face. “It’s a long story.”\\n“We’re not going \\nanywhere,” rebutted Eragon.\\n“It’s too late \\nto talk.”\\n“There probably \\nwon’t be time for it tomorrow.”\\nMurtagh wrapped \\nhis arms around his legs and rested his chin on his knees, rocking back and \\nforth as he stared at the floor. “It’s not a—” he said, then interrupted \\nhimself. “I don’t want to stop . . . so make yourself comfortable. My story \\nwill take a while.” Eragon shifted against Saphira’s side and nodded. Saphira \\nwatched both of them intently.\\nMurtagh’s first \\nsentence was halting, but his voice gained strength and confidence as he spoke. \\n“As far as I know . . . I am the only child of the Thirteen Servants, or the \\nForsworn as they’re called. There may be others, for the Thirteen had the skill \\nto hide whatever they wanted, but I doubt it, for reasons I’ll explain later.\\n“My parents met \\nin a small village—I never learned where—while my father was traveling on the \\nking’s business. Morzan showed my mother some small kindness, no doubt a ploy \\nto gain her confidence, and when he left, she accompanied him. They traveled \\ntogether for a time, and as is the nature of these things, she fell deeply in \\nlove with him. Morzan was delighted to discover this not only because it gave \\nhim numerous opportunities to torment her but also because he recognized the \\nadvantage of having a servant who wouldn’t betray him.\\n“Thus, when \\nMorzan returned to Galbatorix’s court, my mother became the tool he relied upon \\nmost. He used her to carry his secret messages, and he taught her rudimentary \\nmagic, which helped her remain undiscovered and, on occasion, extract \\ninformation from people. He did his best to protect her from the rest of the \\nThirteen—not out of any feelings for her, but because they would have used her \\nagainst him, given the chance. . . . For three years things proceeded in this \\nmanner, until my mother became pregnant.”\\nMurtagh paused \\nfor a moment, fingering a lock of his hair. He continued in a clipped tone, “My \\nfather was, if nothing else, a cunning man. He knew that the pregnancy put both \\nhim and my mother in danger, not to mention the baby—that is, me. So, in the \\ndead of night, he spirited her away from the palace and took her to his castle. \\nOnce there, he laid down powerful spells that prevented anyone from entering \\nhis estate except for a few chosen servants. In this way the pregnancy was kept \\nsecret from everyone but Galbatorix.\\n“Galbatorix knew \\nthe intimate details of the Thirteen’s lives: their plots, their fights—and \\nmost importantly—their thoughts. He enjoyed watching them battle each other and \\noften helped one or the other for his own amusement. But for some reason he \\nnever revealed my existence.\\n“I was born in \\ndue time and given to a wet nurse so my mother could return to Morzan’s side. \\nShe had no choice in the matter. Morzan allowed her to visit me every few \\nmonths, but otherwise we were kept apart. Another three years passed like this, \\nduring which time he gave me the . . . scar on my back.” Murtagh brooded a \\nminute before continuing.\\n“I would have \\ngrown to manhood in this fashion if Morzan hadn’t been summoned away to hunt \\nfor Saphira’s egg. As soon as he departed, my mother, who had been left behind, \\nvanished. No one knows where she went, or why. The king tried to hunt her down, \\nbut his men couldn’t find her trail—no doubt because of Morzan’s training.\\n“At the time of \\nmy birth, only five of the Thirteen were still alive. By the time Morzan left, \\nthat number had been reduced to three; when he finally faced Brom in Gil’ead, \\nhe was the only one remaining. The Forsworn died through various means: \\nsuicide, ambush, overuse of magic . . . but it was mostly the work of the Varden. \\nI’m told that the king was in a terrible rage because of those losses.\\n“However, before \\nword of Morzan’s and the others’ deaths reached us, my mother returned. Many \\nmonths had passed since she had disappeared. Her health was poor, as if she had \\nsuffered a great illness, and she grew steadily worse. Within a fortnight, she \\ndied.”\\n“What happened \\nthen?” prompted Eragon.\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “I grew up. The king brought me to the palace and arranged for my \\nupbringing. Aside from that, he left me alone.”\\n“Then why did \\nyou leave?”\\nA hard laugh \\nbroke from Murtagh. “Escaped is more like it. At my last birthday, when I \\nturned eighteen, the king summoned me to his quarters for a private dinner. The \\nmessage surprised me because I had always distanced myself from the court and \\nhad rarely met him. We’d talked before, but always within earshot of \\neavesdropping nobles.\\n“I accepted the \\noffer, of course, aware that it would be unwise to refuse. The meal was \\nsumptuous, but throughout it his black eyes never left me. His gaze was \\ndisconcerting; it seemed that he was searching for something hidden in my face. \\nI didn’t know what to make of it and did my best to provide polite \\nconversation, but he refused to talk, and I soon ceased my efforts.\\n“When the meal \\nwas finished, he finally began to speak. You’ve never heard his voice, so it’s \\nhard for me to make you understand what it was like. His words were entrancing, \\nlike a snake whispering gilded lies into my ears. A more convincing and \\nfrightening man I’ve never heard. He wove a vision: a fantasy of the Empire as \\nhe imagined it. There would be beautiful cities built across the country, \\nfilled with the greatest warriors, artisans, musicians, and philosophers. The \\nUrgals would finally be eradicated. And the Empire would expand in every \\ndirection until it reached the four corners of Alagaësia. Peace and prosperity \\nwould flourish, but more wondrous yet, the Riders would be brought back to \\ngently govern over Galbatorix’s fiefdoms.\\n“Entranced, I \\nlistened to him for what must have been hours. When he stopped, I eagerly asked \\nhow the Riders would be reinstated, for everyone knew there were no dragon eggs \\nleft. Galbatorix grew still then and stared at me thoughtfully. For a long time \\nhe was silent, but then he extended his hand and asked, ‘Will you, O son of my \\nfriend, serve me as I labor to bring about this paradise?’\\n“Though I knew \\nthe history behind his and my father’s rise to power, the dream he had painted \\nfor me was too compelling, too seductive to ignore. Ardor for this mission \\nfilled me, and I fervently pledged myself to him. Obviously pleased, Galbatorix \\ngave me his blessing, then dismissed me, saying, ‘I shall call upon you when \\nthe need arises.’\\n“Several months \\npassed before he did. When the summons came, I felt all of my old excitement \\nreturn. We met in private as before, but this time he was not pleasant or \\ncharming. The Varden had just destroyed three brigades in the south, and his \\nwrath was out in full force. He charged me in a terrible voice to take a \\ndetachment of troops and destroy Cantos, where rebels were known to hide \\noccasionally. When I asked what we should do with the people there and how we \\nwould know if they were guilty, he shouted, ‘They’re all traitors! Burn them at \\nthe stake and bury their ashes with dung!’ He continued to rant, cursing his \\nenemies and describing how he would scourge the land of everyone who bore him \\nill will.\\n“His tone was so \\ndifferent from what I had encountered before; it made me realize he didn’t \\npossess the mercy or foresight to gain the people’s loyalty, and he ruled only \\nthrough brute force guided by his own passions. It was at that moment I \\ndetermined to escape him and Urû’baen forever.\\n“As soon as I \\nwas free of his presence, I and my faithful servant, Tornac, made ready for \\nflight. We left that very night, but somehow Galbatorix anticipated my actions, \\nfor there were soldiers waiting for us outside the gates. Ah, my sword was \\nbloody, flashing in the dim lantern glow. We defeated the men . . . but in the \\nprocess Tornac was killed.\\n“Alone and \\nfilled with grief, I fled to an old friend who sheltered me in his estate. \\nWhile I hid, I listened carefully to every rumor, trying to predict \\nGalbatorix’s actions and plan my future. During that time, talk reached me that \\nthe Ra’zac had been sent to capture or kill someone. Remembering the king’s \\nplans for the Riders, I decided to find and follow the Ra’zac, just in case \\ntheydid discover a dragon. And that’s how I found you. . . . I have no \\nmore secrets.”\\nWe still don’t \\nknow if he’s telling the truth,warned Saphira.\\nI know,said Eragon,but \\nwhy would he lie to us?\\nHe might be mad. \\nI doubt it.Eragon ran a \\nfinger over Saphira’s hard scales, watching the light reflect off them. “So why \\ndon’t you join the Varden? They’ll distrust you for a time, but once you prove \\nyour loyalty they’ll treat you with respect. And aren’t they in a sense your \\nallies? They strive to end the king’s reign. Isn’t that what you want?”\\n“Must I spell \\neverything out for you?” demanded Murtagh. “I don’t want Galbatorix to learn \\nwhere I am, which is inevitable if people start saying that I’ve sided with his \\nenemies, which I’ve never done. These,” he paused, then said with distaste, “rebelsare \\ntrying not only to overthrow the king but to destroy the Empire . . . and I \\ndon’t want that to happen. It would sow mayhem and anarchy. The king is flawed, \\nyes, but the system itself is sound. As for earning the Varden’s respect: Ha! \\nOnce I am exposed, they’ll treat me like a criminal or worse. Not only that, \\nsuspicion will fall upon you because we traveled together!”\\nHe’s right,said Saphira.\\nEragon ignored \\nher. “It isn’t that bad,” he said, trying to sound optimistic. Murtagh snorted \\nderisively and looked away. “I’m sure that they won’t be—” His words were cut \\nshort as the door opened a hand’s breadth and two bowls were pushed through the \\nspace. A loaf of bread and a hunk of raw meat followed, then the door was shut \\nagain.\\n“Finally!” \\ngrumbled Murtagh, going to the food. He tossed the meat to Saphira, who snapped \\nit out of the air and swallowed it whole. Then he tore the loaf in two, gave \\nhalf to Eragon, picked up his bowl, and retreated to a corner.\\nThey ate \\nsilently. Murtagh jabbed at his food. “I’m going to sleep,” he announced, \\nputting down his bowl without another word.\\n“Good night,” \\nsaid Eragon. He lay next to Saphira, his arms under his head. She curled her \\nlong neck around him, like a cat wrapping its tail around itself, and laid her \\nhead alongside his. One of her wings extended over him like a blue tent, \\nenveloping him in darkness.\\nGood night, \\nlittle one.\\n\\nA small smile \\nlifted Eragon’s lips, but he was already asleep.\\nT HEGLORYOFTRONJHEIM\\nEragon jolted \\nupright as a growl sounded in his ear. Saphira was still asleep, her eyes \\nwandering sightlessly under her eyelids, and her upper lip trembled, as if she \\nwere going to snarl. He smiled, then jerked as she growled again.\\nShe must be \\ndreaming,he \\nrealized. He watched her for a minute, then carefully slid out from under her \\nwing. He stood and stretched. The room was cool, but not unpleasantly so. \\nMurtagh lay on his back in the far corner, his eyes closed.\\nAs Eragon \\nstepped around Saphira, Murtagh stirred. “Morning,” he said quietly, sitting \\nup.\\n“How long have \\nyou been awake?” asked Eragon in a hushed voice.\\n“Awhile. I’m \\nsurprised Saphira didn’t wake you sooner.”\\n“I was tired \\nenough to sleep through a thunderstorm,” said Eragon wryly. He sat by Murtagh \\nand rested his head against the wall. “Do you know what time it is?”\\n“No. It’s \\nimpossible to tell in here.”\\n“Has anyone come \\nto see us?”\\n“Not yet.”\\nThey sat \\ntogether without moving or speaking. Eragon felt oddly bound to Murtagh.I’ve \\nbeen carrying his father’s sword, which would have been his . . . his \\ninheritance. We’re alike in many ways, yet our outlook and upbringing are \\ntotally different. He thought of Murtagh’s scar and shivered.What man \\ncould do that to a child?\\nSaphira lifted \\nher head and blinked to clear her eyes. She sniffed the air, then yawned \\nexpansively, her rough tongue curling at the tip.Has anything happened? \\nEragon shook his head.I hope they give me more food than that snack last \\nnight. I’m hungry enough to eat a herd of cows.\\nThey’ll feed \\nyou,he \\nassured her.\\nThey’d better.She positioned \\nherself near the door and settled down to wait, tail flicking. Eragon closed \\nhis eyes, enjoying the rest. He dozed awhile, then got up and paced around. \\nBored, he examined one of the lanterns. It was made of a single piece of \\nteardrop-shaped glass, about twice the size of a lemon, and filled with soft \\nblue light that neither wavered nor flickered. Four slim metal ribs wrapped \\nsmoothly around the glass, meeting at the top to form a small hook and again at \\nthe bottom where they melded together into three graceful legs. The whole piece \\nwas quite attractive.\\nEragon’s \\ninspection was interrupted by voices outside the room. The door opened, and a \\ndozen warriors marched inside. The first man gulped when he saw Saphira. They \\nwere followed by Orik and the bald man, who declared, “You have been summoned \\nto Ajihad, leader of the Varden. If you must eat, do so while we march.” Eragon \\nand Murtagh stood together, watching him warily.\\n“Where are our \\nhorses? And can I have my sword and bow back?” asked Eragon.\\nThe bald man \\nlooked at him with disdain. “Your weapons will be returned to you when Ajihad \\nsees fit, not before. As for your horses, they await you in the tunnel. Now \\ncome!”\\nAs he turned to \\nleave, Eragon asked quickly, “How is Arya?”\\nThe bald man \\nhesitated. “I do not know. The healers are still with her.” He exited the room, \\naccompanied by Orik.\\nOne of the \\nwarriors motioned. “You go first.” Eragon went through the doorway, followed by \\nSaphira and Murtagh. They returned through the corridor they had traversed the \\nnight before, passing the statue of the quilled animal. When they reached the \\nhuge tunnel through which they had first entered the mountain, the bald man was \\nwaiting with Orik, who held Tornac’s and Snowfire’s reins.\\n“You will ride \\nsingle file down the center of the tunnel,” instructed the bald man. “If you \\nattempt to go anywhere else, you will be stopped.” When Eragon started to climb \\nonto Saphira, the bald man shouted, “No! Ride your horse until I tell you \\notherwise.”\\nEragon shrugged \\nand took Snowfire’s reins. He swung into the saddle, guided Snowfire in front \\nof Saphira, and told her,Stay close in case I need your help.\\nOf course,she said.\\nMurtagh mounted \\nTornac behind Saphira. The bald man examined their small line, then gestured at \\nthe warriors, who divided in half to surround them, giving Saphira as wide a \\nberth as possible. Orik and the bald man went to the head of the procession.\\nAfter looking \\nthem over once more, the bald man clapped twice and started walking forward. \\nEragon tapped Snowfire lightly on his flanks. The entire group headed toward \\nthe heart of the mountain. Echoes filled the tunnel as the horses’ hooves \\nstruck the hard floor, the sounds amplified in the deserted passageway. Doors \\nand gates occasionally disturbed the smooth walls, but they were always closed.\\nEragon marveled \\nat the sheer size of the tunnel, which had been mined with incredible skill—the \\nwalls, floor, and ceiling were crafted with flawless precision. The angles at \\nthe bases of the walls were perfectly square, and as far as he could tell, the \\ntunnel itself did not vary from its course by even an inch.\\nAs they proceeded, \\nEragon’s anticipation about meeting Ajihad increased. The leader of the Varden \\nwas a shadowy figure to the people within the Empire. He had risen to power \\nnearly twenty years ago and since then had waged a fierce war against King \\nGalbatorix. No one knew where he came from or even what he looked like. It was \\nrumored that he was a master strategist, a brutal fighter. With such a \\nreputation, Eragon worried about how they would be received. Still, knowing \\nthat Brom had trusted the Varden enough to serve them helped to allay his \\nfears.\\nSeeing Orik \\nagain had brought forth new questions in his mind. The tunnel was obviously \\ndwarf work—no one else could mine with such skill—but were the dwarves part of \\nthe Varden, or were they merely sheltering them? And who was the king that Orik \\nhad mentioned? Was it Ajihad? Eragon understood now that the Varden had been \\nable to escape discovery by hiding underground, but what about the elves? Where \\nwere they?\\nFor nearly an \\nhour the bald man led them through the tunnel, never straying nor turning.We’ve \\nprobably already gone a league, Eragon realized.Maybe they’re taking us \\nall the way through the mountain! At last a soft white glow became visible \\nahead of them. He strained his eyes, trying to discern its source, but it was \\nstill too far away to make out any details. The glow increased in strength as \\nthey neared it.\\nNow he could see \\nthick marble pillars laced with rubies and amethysts standing in rows along the \\nwalls. Scores of lanterns hung between the pillars, suffusing the air with \\nliquid brilliance. Gold tracery gleamed from the pillars’ bases like molten \\nthread. Arching over the ceiling were carved raven heads, their beaks open in \\nmid-screech. At the end of the hallway rested two colossal black doors, \\naccented by shimmering silver lines that depicted a seven-pointed crown that \\nspanned both sides.\\nThe bald man \\nstopped and raised a hand. He turned to Eragon. “You will ride upon your dragon \\nnow. Do not attempt to fly away. There will be people watching, so remember who \\nand what you are.”\\nEragon \\ndismounted Snowfire, and then clambered onto Saphira’s back.I think they \\nwant to show us off, she said as he settled into the saddle.\\nWe’ll see. I \\nwish I had Zar’roc,he \\nreplied, tightening the straps around his legs.\\nIt might be \\nbetter that you aren’t wearing Morzan’s sword when the Varden first see you. \\nTrue.“I’m ready,” \\nEragon said, squaring his shoulders.\\n“Good,” said the \\nbald man. He and Orik retreated to either side of Saphira, staying far enough \\nback so she was clearly in the lead. “Now walk to the doors, and once they \\nopen, follow the path. Go slowly.”\\nReady?asked Eragon.\\nOf course.Saphira \\napproached the doors at a measured pace. Her scales sparkled in the light, \\nsending glints of color dancing over the pillars. Eragon took a deep breath to \\nsteady his nerves.\\nWithout warning, \\nthe doors swung outward on hidden joints. As the rift widened between them, \\nrays of sunlight streamed into the tunnel, falling on Saphira and Eragon. \\nTemporarily blinded, Eragon blinked and squinted. When his eyes adjusted to the \\nlight, he gasped.\\nThey were inside \\na massive volcanic crater. Its walls narrowed to a small ragged opening so high \\nabove that Eragon could not judge the distance—it might have been more than a \\ndozen miles. A soft beam of light fell through the aperture, illuminating the \\ncrater’s center, though it left the rest of the cavernous expanse in hushed \\ntwilight.\\nThe crater’s far \\nside, hazy blue in the distance, looked to be nearly ten miles away. Giant \\nicicles hundreds of feet thick and thousands of feet long hung leagues above \\nthem like glistening daggers. Eragon knew from his experience in the valley \\nthat no one, not even Saphira, could reach those lofty points. Farther down the \\ncrater’s inner walls, dark mats of moss and lichen covered the rock.\\nHe lowered his \\ngaze and saw a wide cobblestone path extending from the doors’ threshold. The \\npath ran straight to the center of the crater, where it ended at the base of a \\nsnowy-white mountain that glittered like an uncut gem with thousands of colored \\nlights. It was less than a tenth of the height of the crater that loomed over \\nand around it, but its diminutive appearance was deceiving, for it was slightly \\nhigher than a mile.\\nLong as it was, \\nthe tunnel had only taken them through one side of the crater wall. As Eragon \\nstared, he heard Orik say deeply, “Look well, human, for no Rider has set eyes \\nupon this for nigh over a hundred years. The airy peak under which we stand is \\nFarthen Dûr—discovered thousands of years ago by the father of our race, \\nKorgan, while he tunneled for gold. And in the center stands our greatest \\nachievement: Tronjheim, the city-mountain built from the purest marble.” The \\ndoors grated to a halt.\\nA city! \\nThen Eragon saw \\nthe crowd. He had been so engrossed by the sights that he had failed to notice \\na dense sea of people clustered around the tunnel’s entrance. They lined the \\ncobblestone pathway—dwarves and humans packed together like trees in a thicket. \\nThere were hundreds . . . thousands of them. Every eye, every face was focused \\non Eragon. And every one of them was silent.\\nEragon gripped \\nthe base of one of Saphira’s neck spikes. He saw children in dirty smocks, \\nhardy men with scarred knuckles, women in homespun dresses, and stout, \\nweathered dwarves who fingered their beards. All of them bore the same taut \\nexpression—that of an injured animal when a predator is nearby and escape is \\nimpossible.\\nA bead of sweat \\nrolled down Eragon’s face, but he dared not move to wipe it away.What should \\nI do? he asked frantically.\\nSmile, raise \\nyour hand, anything!replied \\nSaphira sharply.\\nEragon tried to \\nforce out a smile, but his lips only twitched. Gathering his courage, he pushed \\na hand into the air, jerking it in a little wave. When nothing happened, he \\nflushed with embarrassment, lowered his arm, and ducked his head.\\nA single cheer \\nbroke the silence. Someone clapped loudly. For a brief second the crowd \\nhesitated, then a wild roar swept through it, and a wave of sound crashed over \\nEragon.\\n“Very good,” \\nsaid the bald man from behind him. “Now start walking.”\\nRelieved, Eragon \\nsat straighter and playfully asked Saphira,Shall we go? She arched her \\nneck and stepped forward. As they passed the first row of people, she glanced \\nto each side and exhaled a puff of smoke. The crowd quieted and shrank back, \\nthen resumed cheering, their enthusiasm only intensified.\\nShow-off,chided Eragon. \\nSaphira flicked her tail and ignored him. He stared curiously at the jostling \\ncrowd as she proceeded along the path. Dwarves greatly outnumbered humans . . . \\nand many of them glared at him resentfully. Some even turned their backs and \\nwalked away with stony faces.\\nThe humans were \\nhard, tough people. All the men had daggers or knives at their waists; many \\nwere armed for war. The women carried themselves proudly, but they seemed to \\nconceal a deep-abiding weariness. The few children and babies stared at Eragon \\nwith large eyes. He felt certain that these people had experienced much \\nhardship and that they would do whatever was necessary to defend themselves.\\nThe Varden had \\nfound the perfect hiding place. Farthen Dûr’s walls were too high for a dragon \\nto fly over, and no army could break through the entranceway, even if it \\nmanaged to find the hidden doors.\\nThe crowd \\nfollowed close behind them, giving Saphira plenty of room. Gradually the people \\nquieted, though their attention remained on Eragon. He looked back and saw \\nMurtagh riding stiffly, his face pale.\\nThey neared the \\ncity-mountain, and Eragon saw that the white marble of Tronjheim was highly \\npolished and shaped into flowing contours, as if it had been poured into place. \\nIt was dotted with countless round windows framed by elaborate carvings. A \\ncolored lantern hung in each window, casting a soft glow on the surrounding \\nrock. No turrets or smokestacks were visible. Directly ahead, two \\nthirty-foot-high gold griffins guarded a massive timber gate—recessed twenty \\nyards into the base of Tronjheim—which was shadowed by thick trusses that \\nsupported an arched vault far overhead.\\nWhen they \\nreached Tronjheim’s base, Saphira paused to see if the bald man had any \\ninstructions. When none were forthcoming, she continued to the gate. The walls \\nwere lined with fluted pillars of blood-red jasper. Between the pillars hulked \\nstatues of outlandish creatures, captured forever by the sculptor’s chisel.\\nThe heavy gate \\nrumbled open before them as hidden chains slowly raised the mammoth beams. A \\nfour-story-high passageway extended straight toward the center of Tronjheim. \\nThe top three levels were pierced by rows of archways that revealed gray tunnels \\ncurving off into the distance. Clumps of people filled the arches, eagerly \\nwatching Eragon and Saphira. On ground level, however, the archways were barred \\nby stout doors. Rich tapestries hung between the different levels, embroidered \\nwith heroic figures and tumultuous battle scenes.\\nA cheer rang in \\ntheir ears as Saphira stepped into the hall and paraded down it. Eragon raised \\nhis hand, eliciting another roar from the throng, though many of the dwarves \\ndid not join the welcoming shout.\\nThe mile-long \\nhall ended in an arch flanked by black onyx pillars. Yellow zircons three times \\nthe size of a man capped the dark columns, coruscating piercing gold beams \\nalong the hall. Saphira stepped through the opening, then stopped and craned \\nback her neck, humming deeply in her chest.\\nThey were in a \\ncircular room, perhaps a thousand feet across, that reached up to Tronjheim’s \\npeak a mile overhead, narrowing as it rose. The walls were lined with \\narches—one row for each level of the city-mountain—and the floor was made of \\npolished carnelian, upon which was etched a hammer girdled by twelve silver \\npentacles, like on Orik’s helm.\\nThe room was a \\nnexus for four hallways—including the one they had just exited—that divided \\nTronjheim into quarters. The halls were identical except for the one opposite \\nEragon. To the right and left of that hall were tall arches that opened to \\ndescending stairs, which mirrored each other as they curved underground.\\nThe ceiling was \\ncapped by a dawn-red star sapphire of monstrous size. The jewel was twenty \\nyards across and nearly as thick. Its face had been carved to resemble a rose \\nin full bloom, and so skilled was the craftsmanship, the flower almost seemed \\nto be real. A wide belt of lanterns wrapped around the edge of the sapphire, \\nwhich cast striated bands of blushing light over everything below. The flashing \\nrays of the star within the gem made it appear as if a giant eye gazed down at \\nthem.\\nEragon could \\nonly gape with wonder. Nothing had prepared him for this. It seemed impossible \\nthat Tronjheim had been built by mortal beings. The city-mountain shamed \\neverything he had seen in the Empire. He doubted if even Urû’baen could match \\nthe wealth and grandeur displayed here. Tronjheim was a stunning monument to \\nthe dwarves’ power and perseverance.\\nThe bald man \\nwalked in front of Saphira and said, “You must go on foot from here.” There was \\nscattered booing from the crowd as he spoke. A dwarf took Tornac and Snowfire \\naway. Eragon dismounted Saphira but stayed by her side as the bald man led them \\nacross the carnelian floor to the right-hand hallway.\\nThey followed it \\nfor several hundred feet, then entered a smaller corridor. Their guards \\nremained despite the cramped space. After four sharp turns, they came to a \\nmassive cedar door, stained black with age. The bald man pulled it open and \\nconducted everyone but the guards inside.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 44': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA JIHAD \\nEragon entered an \\nelegant, two-story study paneled with rows of cedar bookshelves. A wrought-iron \\nstaircase wound up to a small balcony with two chairs and a reading table. \\nWhite lanterns hung along the walls and ceiling so a book could be read \\nanywhere in the room. The stone floor was covered by an intricate oval rug. At \\nthe far end of the room, a man stood behind a large walnut desk.\\nHis skin gleamed \\nthe color of oiled ebony. The dome of his head was shaved bare, but a closely \\ntrimmed black beard covered his chin and upper lip. Strong features shadowed \\nhis face, and grave, intelligent eyes lurked under his brow. His shoulders were \\nbroad and powerful, emphasized by a tapered red vest embroidered with gold \\nthread and clasped over a rich purple shirt. He bore himself with great \\ndignity, exuding an intense, commanding air.\\nWhen he spoke, \\nhis voice was strong, confident: “Welcome to Tronjheim, Eragon and Saphira. I \\nam Ajihad. Please, seat yourselves.”\\nEragon slipped \\ninto an armchair next to Murtagh, while Saphira settled protectively behind \\nthem. Ajihad raised his hand and snapped his fingers. A man stepped out from \\nbehind the staircase. He was identical to the bald man beside him. Eragon \\nstared at the two of them with surprise, and Murtagh stiffened. “Your confusion \\nis understandable; they are twin brothers,” said Ajihad with a small smile. “I \\nwould tell you their names, but they have none.”\\nSaphira hissed \\nwith distaste. Ajihad watched her for a moment, then sat in a high-backed chair \\nbehind the desk. The Twins retreated under the stairs and stood impassively \\nbeside each other. Ajihad pressed his fingers together as he stared at Eragon \\nand Murtagh. He studied them for a long time with an unwavering gaze.\\nEragon squirmed, \\nuncomfortable. After what seemed like several minutes, Ajihad lowered his hands \\nand beckoned to the Twins. One of them hurried to his side. Ajihad whispered in \\nhis ear. The bald man suddenly paled and shook his head vigorously. Ajihad \\nfrowned, then nodded as if something had been confirmed.\\nHe looked at \\nMurtagh. “You have placed me in a difficult position by refusing to be \\nexamined. You have been allowed into Farthen Dûr because the Twins have assured \\nme that they can control you and because of your actions on behalf of Eragon \\nand Arya. I understand that there may be things you wish to keep hidden in your \\nmind, but as long as you do, we cannot trust you.”\\n“You wouldn’t \\ntrust me anyway,” said Murtagh defiantly.\\nAjihad’s face \\ndarkened as Murtagh spoke, and his eyes flashed dangerously. “Though it’s been \\ntwenty and three years since it last broke upon my ear . . . I know that \\nvoice.” He stood ominously, chest swelling. The Twins looked alarmed and put \\ntheir heads together, whispering frantically. “It came from another man, one \\nmore beast than human. Get up.”\\nMurtagh warily \\ncomplied, his eyes darting between the Twins and Ajihad. “Remove your shirt,” \\nordered Ajihad. With a shrug, Murtagh pulled off his tunic. “Now turn around.” \\nAs he pivoted to the side, light fell upon the scar on his back.\\n“Murtagh,” \\nbreathed Ajihad. A grunt of surprise came from Orik. Without warning, Ajihad \\nturned on the Twins and thundered, “Did you know of this?”\\nThe Twins bowed \\ntheir heads. “We discovered his name in Eragon’s mind, but we did not suspect \\nthat thisboy was the son of one as powerful as Morzan. It never \\noccurred—”\\n“And you didn’t \\ntell me?” demanded Ajihad. He raised a hand, forestalling their explanation. \\n“We will discuss it later.” He faced Murtagh again. “First I must untangle this \\nmuddle. Do you still refuse to be probed?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nMurtagh sharply, slipping back into his tunic. “I won’t let anyone inside my \\nhead.”\\nAjihad leaned on \\nhis desk. “There will be unpleasant consequences if you don’t. Unless the Twins \\ncan certify that you aren’t a threat, we cannot give you credence, despite, and \\nperhaps because of, the assistance you have given Eragon. Without that \\nverification, the people here, dwarf and human alike, will tear you apart if \\nthey learn of your presence. I’ll be forced to keep you confined at all \\ntimes—as much for your protection as for ours. It will only get worse once the \\ndwarf king, Hrothgar, demands custody of you. Don’t force yourself into that \\nsituation when it can easily be avoided.”\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head stubbornly. “No . . . even if I were to submit, I would still be \\ntreated like a leper and an outcast. All I wish is to leave. If you let me do \\nthat peacefully, I’ll never reveal your location to the Empire.”\\n“What will \\nhappen if you are captured and brought before Galbatorix?” demanded Ajihad. “He \\nwill extract every secret from your mind, no matter how strong you may be. Even \\nif you could resist him, how can we trust that you won’t rejoin him in the \\nfuture? I cannot take that chance.”\\n“Will you hold \\nme prisoner forever?” demanded Murtagh, straightening.\\n“No,” said \\nAjihad, “only until you let yourself be examined. If you are found trustworthy, \\nthe Twins will remove all knowledge of Farthen Dûr’s location from your mind \\nbefore you leave. We won’t risk someone with those memories falling into \\nGalbatorix’s hands. What is it to be, Murtagh? Decide quickly or else the path \\nwill be chosen for you.”\\nJust give in,Eragon pleaded \\nsilently, concerned for Murtagh’s safety.It’s not worth the fight.\\nFinally Murtagh \\nspoke, the words slow and distinct. “My mind is the one sanctuary that has not \\nbeen stolen from me. Men have tried to breach it before, but I’ve learned to \\ndefend it vigorously, for I am only safe with my innermost thoughts. You have \\nasked for the one thing I cannot give, least of all to those two.” He gestured \\nat the Twins. “Do with me what you will, but know this: death will take me \\nbefore I’ll expose myself to their probing.”\\nAdmiration \\nglinted in Ajihad’s eyes. “I’m not surprised by your choice, though I had hoped \\notherwise. . . . Guards!” The cedar door slammed open as warriors rushed in, \\nweapons ready. Ajihad pointed at Murtagh and commanded, “Take him to a \\nwindowless room and bar the door securely. Post six men by the entrance and \\nallow no one inside until I come to see him. Do not speak to him, either.”\\nThe warriors \\nsurrounded Murtagh, watching him suspiciously. As they left the study, Eragon \\ncaught Murtagh’s attention and mouthed, “I’m sorry.” Murtagh shrugged, then \\nstared forward resolutely. He vanished into the hallway with the men. The sound \\nof their feet faded into silence.\\nAjihad said \\nabruptly, “I want everyone out of this room but Eragon and Saphira. Now!”\\nBowing, the \\nTwins departed, but Orik said, “Sir, the king will want to know of Murtagh. And \\nthere is still the matter of my insubordination. . . .”\\nAjihad frowned, \\nthen waved his hand. “I will tell Hrothgar myself. As for your actions . . . \\nwait outside until I call for you. And don’t let the Twins get away. I’m not \\ndone with them, either.”\\n“Very well,” \\nsaid Orik, inclining his head. He closed the door with a solid thump.\\nAfter a long \\nsilence, Ajihad sat with a tired sigh. He ran a hand over his face and stared \\nat the ceiling. Eragon waited impatiently for him to speak. When nothing was \\nforthcoming, he blurted, “Is Arya all right?”\\nAjihad looked \\ndown at him and said gravely, “No . . . but the healers tell me she will \\nrecover. They worked on her all through the night. The poison took a dreadful \\ntoll on her. She wouldn’t have lived if not for you. For that you have the \\nVarden’s deepest thanks.”\\nEragon’s \\nshoulders slumped with relief. For the first time he felt that their flight \\nfrom Gil’ead had been worth the effort. “So, what now?” he asked.\\n“I need you to \\ntell me how you found Saphira and everything that’s happened since,” said \\nAjihad, forming a steeple with his fingers. “Some of it I know from the message \\nBrom sent us, other parts from the Twins. But I want to hear it from you, \\nespecially the details concerning Brom’s death.”\\nEragon was \\nreluctant to share his experiences with a stranger, but Ajihad was patient.Go \\non, urged Saphira gently. Eragon shifted, then began his story. It was \\nawkward at first but grew easier as he proceeded. Saphira helped him to \\nremember things clearly with occasional comments. Ajihad listened intently the \\nentire time.\\nEragon talked \\nfor hours, often pausing between his words. He told Ajihad of Teirm, though he \\nkept Angela’s fortunetelling to himself, and how he and Brom had found the \\nRa’zac. He even related his dreams of Arya. When he came to Gil’ead and \\nmentioned the Shade, Ajihad’s face hardened, and he leaned back with veiled \\neyes.\\nWhen his \\nnarrative was complete, Eragon fell silent, brooding on all that had occurred. \\nAjihad stood, clasped his hands behind his back, and absently studied one of \\nthe bookshelves. After a time he returned to the desk.\\n“Brom’s death is \\na terrible loss. He was a close friend of mine and a powerful ally of the \\nVarden. He saved us from destruction many times through his bravery and \\nintelligence. Even now, when he is gone, he’s provided us with the one thing \\nthat can ensure our success—you.”\\n“But what can \\nyou expect me to accomplish?” asked Eragon.\\n“I will explain \\nit in full,” said Ajihad, “but there are more urgent matters to be dealt with \\nfirst. The news of the Urgals’ alliance with the Empire is extremely serious. \\nIf Galbatorix is gathering an Urgal army to destroy us, the Varden will be hard \\npressed to survive, even though many of us are protected here in Farthen Dûr. \\nThat a Rider, even one as evil as Galbatorix, would consider a pact with such \\nmonsters is indeed proof of madness. I shudder to think of what he promised \\nthem in return for their fickle loyalty. And then there is the Shade. Can you \\ndescribe him?”\\nEragon nodded. \\n“He was tall, thin, and very pale, with red eyes and hair. He was dressed all \\nin black.”\\n“What of his \\nsword—did you see it?” asked Ajihad intensely. “Did it have a long scratch on \\nthe blade?”\\n“Yes,” said \\nEragon, surprised. “How did you know?”\\n“Because I put \\nit there while trying to cut out his heart,” said Ajihad with a grim smile. \\n“His name is Durza—one of the most vicious and cunning fiends to ever stalk \\nthis land. He is the perfect servant for Galbatorix and a dangerous enemy for \\nus. You say that you killed him. How was it done?”\\nEragon \\nremembered it vividly. “Murtagh shot him twice. The first arrow caught him in \\nthe shoulder; the second one struck him between the eyes.”\\n“I was afraid of \\nthat,” said Ajihad, frowning. “You didn’t kill him. Shades can only be \\ndestroyed by a thrust through the heart. Anything short of that will cause them \\nto vanish and then reappear elsewhere in spirit form. It’s an unpleasant \\nprocess, but Durza will survive and return stronger than ever.”\\nA moody silence \\nsettled over them like a foreboding thunderhead. Then Ajihad stated, “You are \\nan enigma, Eragon, a quandary that no one knows how to solve. Everyone knows \\nwhat the Varden want—or the Urgals, or even Galbatorix—but no one knows whatyou \\nwant. And that makes you dangerous, especially to Galbatorix. He fears you \\nbecause he doesn’t know what you will do next.”\\n“Do the Varden \\nfear me?” asked Eragon quietly.\\n“No,” said \\nAjihad carefully. “We are hopeful. But if that hope proves false, then yes, we \\nwill be afraid.” Eragon looked down. “You must understand the unusual nature of \\nyour position. There are factions who want you to serve their interests and no \\none else’s. The moment you entered Farthen Dûr, their influence and power began \\ntugging on you.”\\n“Including \\nyours?” asked Eragon.\\nAjihad chuckled, \\nthough his eyes were sharp. “Including mine. There are certain things you \\nshould know: first is how Saphira’s egg happened to appear in the Spine. Did \\nBrom ever tell you what was done with her egg after he brought it here?”\\n“No,” said \\nEragon, glancing at Saphira. She blinked and flicked her tongue at him.\\nAjihad tapped \\nhis desk before beginning. “When Brom first brought the egg to the Varden, \\neveryone was deeply interested in its fate. We had thought the dragons were \\nexterminated. The dwarves were solely concerned with making sure that the \\nfuture Rider would be an ally—though some of them were opposed to having a new \\nRider at all—while the elves and Varden had a more personal stake in the \\nmatter. The reason was simple enough: throughout history all the Riders have \\nbeen either elven or human, with the majority being elven. There has never been \\na dwarf Rider.\\n“Because of \\nGalbatorix’s betrayals, the elves were reluctant to let any of the Varden \\nhandle the egg for fear that the dragon inside would hatch for a human with \\nsimilar instabilities. It was a challenging situation, as both sides wanted the \\nRider for their own. The dwarves only aggravated the problem by arguing \\nobstinately with both the elves and us whenever they had the chance. Tensions \\nescalated, and before long, threats were made that were later regretted. It was \\nthen that Brom suggested a compromise that allowed all sides to save face.\\n“He proposed \\nthat the egg be ferried between the Varden and the elves every year. At each \\nplace children would parade past it, and then the bearers of the egg would wait \\nto see if the dragon would hatch. If it didn’t, they would leave and return to \\nthe other group. But if the dragondid hatch, the new Rider’s training \\nwould be undertaken immediately. For the first year or so he or she would be \\ninstructed here, by Brom. Then the Rider would be taken to the elves, who would \\nfinish the education.\\n“The elves \\nreluctantly accepted this plan . . . with the stipulation that if Brom were to \\ndie before the dragon hatched, they would be free to train the new Rider \\nwithout interference. The agreement was slanted in their favor—we both knew \\nthat the dragon would likely chose an elf—but it provided a desperately needed \\nsemblance of equality.”\\nAjihad paused, \\nhis rich eyes somber. Shadows bit into his face under his cheekbones, making \\nthem jut out. “It was hoped that this new Rider would bring our two races \\ncloser together. We waited for well over a decade, but the egg never hatched. \\nThe matter passed from our minds, and we rarely thought about it except to \\nlament the egg’s inactivity.\\n“Then last year \\nwe suffered a terrible loss. Arya and the egg disappeared on her return from \\nTronjheim to the elven city Osilon. The elves were the first to discover she \\nwas missing. They found her steed and guards slain in Du Weldenvarden and a \\ngroup of slaughtered Urgals nearby. But neither Arya nor the egg was there. \\nWhen this news reached me, I feared that Urgals had both of them and would soon \\nlearn the location of Farthen Dûr and the elves’ capital, Ellesméra, where \\ntheir queen, Islanzadi, lives. Now I understand they were working for the \\nEmpire, which is far worse.\\n“We won’t know \\nexactly what occurred during that attack until Arya wakes, but I have deduced a \\nfew details from what you’ve said.” Ajihad’s vest rustled as he leaned his \\nelbows on the desk. “The attack must have been swift and decisive, else Arya \\nwould have escaped. Without any warning, and deprived of a place to hide, she could \\nhave done only one thing—used magic to transport the egg elsewhere.”\\n“She can use \\nmagic?” asked Eragon. Arya had mentioned that she had been given a drug to \\nsuppress her power; he wanted to confirm that she meant magic. He wondered if \\nshe could teach him more words of the ancient language.\\n“It was one of \\nthe reasons why she was chosen to guard the egg. Anyway, Arya couldn’t have \\nreturned it to us—she was too far away—and the elves’ realm is warded by arcane \\nbarriers that prevent anything from entering their borders through magical \\nmeans. She must have thought of Brom and, in desperation, sent the egg toward \\nCarvahall. Without time to prepare, I’m not surprised she missed by the margin \\nshe did. The Twins tell me it is an imprecise art.”\\n“Why was she closer \\nto Palancar Valley than the Varden?” asked Eragon. “Where do the elves really \\nlive? Where is this . . . Ellesméra?”\\nAjihad’s keen \\ngaze bored into Eragon as he considered the question. “I don’t tell you this \\nlightly, for the elves guard the knowledge jealously. But you should know, and \\nI do this as a display of trust. Their cities lie far to the north, in the \\ndeepest reaches of the endless forest Du Weldenvarden. Not since the Riders’ \\ntime has anyone, dwarf or human, been elf-friend enough to walk in their leafy \\nhalls. I do not even know how to find Ellesméra. As for Osilon . . . based on \\nwhere Arya disappeared, I suspect it is near Du Weldenvarden’s western edge, \\ntoward Carvahall. You must have many other questions, but bear with me and keep \\nthem until I have finished.”\\nHe gathered his \\nmemories, then spoke at a quickened pace. “When Arya disappeared, the elves \\nwithdrew their support from the Varden. Queen Islanzadi was especially enraged \\nand refused any further contact with us. As a result, even though I received \\nBrom’s message, the elves are still ignorant of you and Saphira. . . . Without \\ntheir supplies to sustain my troops, we have fared badly these past months in \\nskirmishes with the Empire.\\n“With Arya’s \\nreturn and your arrival, I expect the queen’s hostility will abate. The fact \\nthat you rescued Arya will greatly help our case with her. Your training, \\nhowever, is going to present a problem for both Varden and elves. Brom \\nobviously had a chance to teach you, but we need to know how thorough he was. \\nFor that reason, you’ll have to be tested to determine the extent of your \\nabilities. Also, the elves will expect you to finish your training with them, \\nthough I’m not sure if there’s time for that.”\\n“Why not?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“For several \\nreasons. Chief among them, the tidings you brought about the Urgals,” said \\nAjihad, his eyes straying to Saphira. “You see, Eragon, the Varden are in an \\nextremely delicate position. On one hand, we have to comply with the elves’ \\nwishes if we want to keep them as allies. At the same time, we cannot anger the \\ndwarves if we wish to lodge in Tronjheim.”\\n“Aren’t the \\ndwarves part of the Varden?” asked Eragon.\\nAjihad \\nhesitated. “In a sense, yes. They allow us to live here and provide assistance \\nin our struggle against the Empire, but they are loyal only to their king. I \\nhave no power over them except for what Hrothgar gives me, and even he often \\nhas trouble with the dwarf clans. The thirteen clans are subservient to \\nHrothgar, but each clan chief wields enormous power; they choose the new dwarf \\nking when the old one dies. Hrothgar is sympathetic to our cause, but many of \\nthe chiefs aren’t. He can’t afford to anger them unnecessarily or he’ll lose \\nthe support of his people, so his actions on our behalf have been severely \\ncircumscribed.”\\n“These clan \\nchiefs,” said Eragon, “are they against me as well?”\\n“Even more so, \\nI’m afraid,” said Ajihad wearily. “There has long been enmity between dwarves \\nand dragons—before the elves came and made peace, dragons made a regular habit \\nof eating the dwarves’ flocks and stealing their gold—and the dwarves are slow \\nto forget past wrongs. Indeed, they never fully accepted the Riders or allowed \\nthem to police their kingdom. Galbatorix’s rise to power has only served to \\nconvince many of them that it would be better never to deal with Riders or \\ndragons ever again.” He directed his last words at Saphira.\\nEragon said \\nslowly, “Why doesn’t Galbatorix know where Farthen Dûr and Ellesméra are? \\nSurely he was told of them when he was instructed by the Riders.”\\n“Told of them, yes—shown \\nwhere they are, no. It’s one thing to know that Farthen Dûr lies within these \\nmountains, quite another to find it. Galbatorix hadn’t been taken to either \\nplace before his dragon was killed. After that, of course, the Riders didn’t \\ntrust him. He tried to force the information out of several Riders during his \\nrebellion, but they chose to die rather than reveal it to him. As for the \\ndwarves, he’s never managed to capture one alive, though it’s only a matter of \\ntime.”\\n“Then why \\ndoesn’t he just take an army and march through Du Weldenvarden until he finds \\nEllesméra?” asked Eragon.\\n“Because the \\nelves still have enough power to resist him,” said Ajihad. “He doesn’t dare \\ntest his strength against theirs, at least not yet. But his cursed sorcery \\ngrows stronger each year. With another Rider at his side, he would be \\nunstoppable. He keeps trying to get one of his two eggs to hatch, but so far \\nhe’s been unsuccessful.”\\nEragon was \\npuzzled. “How can his power be increasing? The strength of his body limits his \\nabilities—it can’t build itself up forever.”\\n“We don’t know,” \\nsaid Ajihad, shrugging his broad shoulders, “and neither do the elves. We can \\nonly hope that someday he will be destroyed by one of his own spells.” He \\nreached inside his vest and somberly pulled out a battered piece of parchment. \\n“Do you know what this is?” he asked, placing it on the desk.\\nEragon bent \\nforward and examined it. Lines of black script, written in an alien language, \\nwere inked across the page. Large sections of the writing had been destroyed by \\nblots of blood. One edge of the parchment was charred. He shook his head. “No, \\nI don’t.”\\n“It was taken \\nfrom the leader of the Urgal host we destroyed last night. It cost us twelve \\nmen to do so—they sacrificed themselves so that you might escape safely. The \\nwriting is the king’s invention, a script he uses to communicate with his \\nservants. It took me a while, but I was able to devise its meaning, at least \\nwhere it’s legible. It reads:\\n\\xa0\\n. . . gatekeeper \\nat Ithrö Zhâda is to let this bearer and his minions pass. They are to be \\nbunked with the others of their kind and by . . . but only if the two factions \\nrefrain from fighting. Command will be given under Tarok, under Gashz, under \\nDurza, under Ushnark the Mighty.\\n\\xa0\\n“Ushnark is \\nGalbatorix. It means ‘father’ in the Urgal tongue, an affectation that pleases \\nhim.\\n\\xa0\\nFind what they \\nare suitable for and . . . The footmen and . . . are to be kept separate. No \\nweapons are to be distributed until . . . for marching.\\n\\xa0\\n“Nothing else \\ncan be read past there, except for a few vague words,” said Ajihad.\\n“Where’s Ithrö \\nZhâda? I’ve never heard of it.”\\n“Nor have I,” \\nconfirmed Ajihad, “which makes me suspect that Galbatorix has renamed an \\nexisting place for his own purposes. After deciphering this, I asked myself \\nwhat hundreds of Urgals were doing by the Beor Mountains where you first saw \\nthem and where they were going. The parchment mentions ‘others of their kind,’ \\nso I assume there are even more Urgals at their destination. There’s only one \\nreason for the king to gather such a force—to forge a bastard army of humans \\nand monsters to destroy us.\\n“For now, there \\nis nothing to do but wait and watch. Without further information we cannot find \\nthis Ithrö Zhâda. Still, Farthen Dûr has not yet been discovered, so there is \\nhope. The only Urgals to have seen it died last night.”\\n“How did you \\nknow we were coming?” asked Eragon. “One of the Twins was waiting for us, and \\nthere was an ambush in place for the Kull.” He was aware of Saphira listening \\nintently. Though she kept her own counsel, he knew she would have things to say \\nlater.\\n“We have \\nsentinels placed at the entrance of the valley you traveled through—on either \\nside of the Beartooth River. They sent a dove to warn us,” explained Ajihad.\\nEragon wondered \\nif it was the same bird Saphira had tried to eat. “When the egg and Arya \\ndisappeared, did you tell Brom? He said that he hadn’t heard anything from the \\nVarden.”\\n“We tried to \\nalert him,” said Ajihad, “but I suspect our men were intercepted and killed by \\nthe Empire. Why else would the Ra’zac have gone to Carvahall? After that, Brom \\nwas traveling with you, and it was impossible to get word to him. I was \\nrelieved when he contacted me via messenger from Teirm. It didn’t surprise me \\nthat he went to Jeod; they were old friends. And Jeod could easily send us a \\nmessage because he smuggles supplies to us through Surda.\\n“All of this has \\nraised serious questions. How did the Empire know where to ambush Arya and, \\nlater, our messengers to Carvahall? How has Galbatorix learned which merchants \\nhelp the Varden? Jeod’s business has been virtually destroyed since you left \\nhim, as have those of other merchants who support us. Every time one of their \\nships sets sail, it disappears. The dwarves cannot give us everything we need, \\nso the Varden are in desperate need of supplies. I’m afraid that we have a \\ntraitor, or traitors, in our midst, despite our efforts to examine people’s \\nminds for deceit.”\\nEragon sank deep \\nin thought, pondering what he had learned. Ajihad waited calmly for him to \\nspeak, undisturbed by the silence. For the first time since finding Saphira’s \\negg, Eragon felt that he understood what was going on around him. At last he \\nknew where Saphira came from and what might lie in his future. “What do you \\nwant from me?” he asked.\\n“How do you \\nmean?”\\n“I mean, what is \\nexpected of me in Tronjheim? You and the elves have plans for me, but what if I \\ndon’t like them?” A hard note crept into his voice. “I’ll fight when needed, \\nrevel when there’s occasion, mourn when there is grief, and die if my time \\ncomes . . . but I won’t let anyone use me against my will.” He paused to let \\nthe words sink in. “The Riders of old were arbiters of justice above and beyond \\nthe leaders of their time. I don’t claim that position—I doubt people would \\naccept such oversight when they’ve been free of it all their lives, especially \\nfrom one as young as me. But Ido have power, and I will wield it as I \\nsee fit. What I want to know is howyou plan to use me. Then I will \\ndecide whether to agree to it.”\\nAjihad looked at \\nhim wryly. “If you were anyone else and were before another leader, you would \\nlikely have been killed for that insolent speech. What makes you think I will \\nexpose my plans just because you demand it?” Eragon flushed but did not lower \\nhis gaze. “Still, you are right. Your position gives you the privilege to say \\nsuch things. You cannot escape the politics of your situation—youwill be \\ninfluenced, one way or another. I don’t want to see you become a pawn of any \\none group or purpose any more than you do. You must retain your freedom, for in \\nit lies your true power: the ability to make choices independent of any leader \\nor king. My own authority over you will be limited, but I believe it’s for the \\nbest. The difficulty lies in making sure that those with power include you in \\ntheir deliberations.\\n“Also, despite \\nyour protests, the people here have certain expectations of you. They are going \\nto bring you their problems, no matter how petty, and demand that you solve \\nthem.” Ajihad leaned forward, his voice deadly serious. “There will be cases \\nwhere someone’s future will rest in your hands . . . with a word you can send \\nthem careening into happiness or misery. Young women will seek your opinion on \\nwhom they should marry—many will pursue you as a husband—and old men will ask \\nwhich of their children should receive an inheritance. Youmust be kind \\nand wise with them all, for they put their trust in you. Don’t speak flippantly \\nor without thought, because your words will have impact far beyond what you \\nintend.”\\nAjihad leaned \\nback, his eyes hooded. “The burden of leadership is being responsible for the \\nwell-being of the people in your charge. I have dealt with it from the day I \\nwas chosen to head the Varden, and now you must as well. Be careful. I won’t \\ntolerate injustice under my command. Don’t worry about your youth and \\ninexperience; they will pass soon enough.”\\nEragon was \\nuncomfortable with the idea of people asking him for advice. “But you still \\nhaven’t said what I’m to do here.”\\n“For now, \\nnothing. You covered over a hundred and thirty leagues in eight days, a feat to \\nbe proud of. I’m sure that you’ll appreciate rest. When you’ve recovered, we \\nwill test your competency in arms and magic. After that—well, I will explain \\nyour options, and then you’ll have to decide your course.”\\n“And what about \\nMurtagh?” asked Eragon bitingly.\\nAjihad’s face \\ndarkened. He reached beneath his desk and lifted up Zar’roc. The sword’s \\npolished sheath gleamed in the light. Ajihad slid his hand over it, lingering \\non the etched sigil. “He will stay here until he allows the Twins into his \\nmind.”\\n“You can’t \\nimprison him,” argued Eragon. “He’s committed no crime!”\\n“We can’t give \\nhim his freedom without being sure that he won’t turn against us. Innocent or \\nnot, he’s potentially as dangerous to us as his father was,” said Ajihad with a \\nhint of sadness.\\nEragon realized \\nthat Ajihad would not be convinced otherwise, and his concernwas valid. \\n“How were you able to recognize his voice?”\\n“I met his \\nfather once,” said Ajihad shortly. He tapped Zar’roc’s hilt. “I wish Brom had \\ntold me he had taken Morzan’s sword. I suggest that you don’t carry it within \\nFarthen Dûr. Many here remember Morzan’s time with hate, especially the \\ndwarves.”\\n“I’ll remember \\nthat,” promised Eragon.\\nAjihad handed \\nZar’roc to him. “That reminds me, I have Brom’s ring, which he sent as \\nconfirmation of his identity. I was keeping it for when he returned to \\nTronjheim. Now that he’s dead, I suppose it belongs to you, and I think he \\nwould have wanted you to have it.” He opened a desk drawer and took the ring \\nfrom it.\\nEragon accepted \\nit with reverence. The symbol cut into the face of the sapphire was identical \\nto the tattoo on Arya’s shoulder. He fit the ring onto his index finger, \\nadmiring how it caught the light. “I . . . I am honored,” he said.\\nAjihad nodded \\ngravely, then pushed back his chair and stood. He faced Saphira and spoke to \\nher, his voice swelling in power. “Do not think that I have forgotten you, O \\nmighty dragon. I have said these things as much for your benefit as for \\nEragon’s. It is even more important that you know them, for to you falls the \\ntask of guarding him in these dangerous times. Do not underestimate your might \\nnor falter at his side, because without you he will surely fail.”\\nSaphira lowered \\nher head until their eyes were level and stared at him through slitted black \\npupils. They examined each other silently, neither of them blinking. Ajihad was \\nthe first to move. He lowered his eyes and said softly, “It is indeed a \\nprivilege to meet you.”\\nHe’ll do,said Saphira \\nrespectfully. She swung her head to face Eragon. Tell him that I am \\nimpressed both with Tronjheim and with him. The Empire is right to fear him. \\nLet him know, however, that if he had decided to kill you, I would have \\ndestroyed Tronjheim and torn him apart with my teeth.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, surprised by the venom in her voice, then relayed the message. \\nAjihad looked at her seriously. “I would expect nothing less from one so \\nnoble—but I doubt you could have gotten past the Twins.”\\nSaphira snorted \\nwith derision.Bah!\\nKnowing what she \\nmeant, Eragon said, “Then they must be much stronger than they appear. I think \\nthey would be sorely dismayed if they ever faced a dragon’s wrath. The two of \\nthem might be able to defeat me, but never Saphira. You should know, a Rider’s \\ndragon strengthens his magic beyond what a normal magician might have. Brom was \\nalways weaker than me because of that. I think that in the absence of Riders, \\nthe Twins have overestimated their power.”\\nAjihad looked \\ntroubled. “Brom was considered one of our strongest spell weavers. Only the \\nelves surpassed him. If what you say is true, we will have to reconsider a \\ngreat many things.” He bowed to Saphira. “As it is, I am glad it wasn’t \\nnecessary to harm either of you.” Saphira dipped her head in return.\\nAjihad \\nstraightened with a lordly air and called, “Orik!” The dwarf hurried into the \\nroom and stood before the desk, crossing his arms. Ajihad frowned at him, \\nirritated. “You’ve caused me a great deal of trouble, Orik. I’ve had to listen \\nto one of the Twins complain all morning about your insubordination. They won’t \\nlet it rest until you are punished. Unfortunately they’re right. It’s a serious \\nmatter that cannot be ignored. An accounting is due.”\\nOrik’s eyes \\nflicked toward Eragon, but his face betrayed no emotion. He spoke quickly in \\nrough tones. “The Kull were almost around Kóstha-mérna. They were shooting \\narrows at the dragon, Eragon, and Murtagh, but the Twins did nothing to stop \\nit. Like . . . sheilven, they refused to open the gates even though we could \\nsee Eragon shouting the opening phrase on the other side of the waterfall. And \\nthey refused to take action when Eragon did not rise from the water. Perhaps I \\ndid wrong, but I couldn’t let a Rider die.”\\n“I wasn’t strong \\nenough to get out of the water myself,” offered Eragon. “I would have drowned \\nif he hadn’t pulled me out.”\\nAjihad glanced \\nat him, then asked Orik seriously, “And later, why did you oppose them?”\\nOrik raised his \\nchin defiantly. “It wasn’t right for them to force their way into Murtagh’s \\nmind. But I wouldn’t have stopped them if I’d known who he was.”\\n“No, you did the \\nright thing, though it would be simpler if you hadn’t. It isn’t our place to \\nforce our way into people’s minds, no matter who they are.” Ajihad fingered his \\ndense beard. “Your actions were honorable, but you did defy a direct order from \\nyour commander. The penalty for that has always been death.” Orik’s back \\nstiffened.\\n“You can’t kill \\nhim for that! He was only helping me,” cried Eragon.\\n“It isn’t your \\nplace to interfere,” said Ajihad sternly. “Orik broke the law and must suffer \\nthe consequences.” Eragon started to argue again, but Ajihad stopped him with a \\nraised hand. “But you are right. The sentence will be mitigated because of the \\ncircumstances. As of now, Orik, you are removed from active service and \\nforbidden to engage in any military activities under my command. Do you \\nunderstand?”\\nOrik’s face \\ndarkened, but then he only looked confused. He nodded sharply. “Yes.”\\n“Furthermore, in \\nthe absence of your regular duties, I appoint you Eragon and Saphira’s guide \\nfor the duration of their stay. You are to make sure they receive every comfort \\nand amenity we have to offer. Saphira will stay above Isidar Mithrim. Eragon \\nmay have quarters wherever he wants. When he recovers from his trip, take him \\nto the training fields. They’re expecting him,” said Ajihad, a twinkle of \\namusement in his eye.\\nOrik bowed low. \\n“I understand.”\\n“Very well, you \\nall may go. Send in the Twins as you leave.”\\nEragon bowed and \\nbegan to leave, then asked, “Where can I find Arya? I would like to see her.”\\n“No one is \\nallowed to visit her. You will have to wait until she comes to you.” Ajihad \\nlooked down at his desk in a clear dismissal.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 45': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nB LESS THECHILD,ARGETLAM\\nEragon stretched \\nin the hall; he was stiff from sitting so long. Behind him, the Twins entered \\nAjihad’s study and closed the door. Eragon looked at Orik. “I’m sorry that \\nyou’re in trouble because of me,” he apologized.\\n“Don’t bother \\nyourself,” grunted Orik, tugging on his beard. “Ajihad gave me what I wanted.”\\nEven Saphira was \\nstartled by the statement. “What do you mean?” said Eragon. “You can’t train or \\nfight, and you’re stuck guarding me. How can that be what you wanted?”\\nThe dwarf eyed \\nhim quietly. “Ajihad is a good leader. He understands how to keep the law yet \\nremain just. I have been punished by his command, but I’m also one of \\nHrothgar’s subjects. Under his rule, I’m still free to do what I wish.”\\nEragon realized \\nit would be unwise to forget Orik’s dual loyalty and the split nature of power \\nwithin Tronjheim. “Ajihad just placed you in a powerful position, didn’t he?”\\nOrik chuckled \\ndeeply. “That he did, and in such a way the Twins can’t complain about it. \\nThis’ll irritate them for sure. Ajihad’s a tricky one, he is. Come, lad, I’m \\nsure you’re hungry. And we have to get your dragon settled in.”\\nSaphira hissed. \\nEragon said, “Her name is Saphira.”\\nOrik made a \\nsmall bow to her. “My apologies, I’ll be sure to remember that.” He took an \\norange lamp from the wall and led them down the hallway.\\n“Can others in \\nFarthen Dûr use magic?” asked Eragon, struggling to keep up with the dwarf’s \\nbrisk pace. He cradled Zar’roc carefully, concealing the symbol on the sheath \\nwith his arm.\\n“Few enough,” \\nsaid Orik with a swift shrug under his mail. “And the ones we have can’t do \\nmuch more than heal bruises. They’ve all had to tend to Arya because of the \\nstrength needed to heal her.”\\n“Except for the \\nTwins.”\\n“Oeí,” grumbled \\nOrik. “She wouldn’t want their help anyway; their arts are not for healing. \\nTheir talents lie in scheming and plotting for power—to everyone else’s \\ndetriment. Deynor, Ajihad’s predecessor, allowed them to join the Varden \\nbecause he needed their support . . . you can’t oppose the Empire without \\nspellcasters who can hold their own on the field of battle. They’re a nasty \\npair, but they do have their uses.”\\nThey entered one \\nof the four main tunnels that divided Tronjheim. Clusters of dwarves and humans \\nstrolled through it, voices echoing loudly off the polished floor. The \\nconversations stopped abruptly as they saw Saphira; scores of eyes fixed on \\nher. Orik ignored the spectators and turned left, heading toward one of \\nTronjheim’s distant gates. “Where are we going?” asked Eragon.\\n“Out of these \\nhalls so Saphira can fly to the dragonhold above Isidar Mithrim, the Star Rose. \\nThe dragonhold doesn’t have a roof—Tronjheim’s peak is open to the sky, like \\nthat of Farthen Dûr—so she, that is, you, Saphira, will be able to glide \\nstraight down into the hold. It is where the Riders used to stay when they \\nvisited Tronjheim.”\\n“Won’t it be \\ncold and damp without a roof?” asked Eragon.\\n“Nay.” Orik \\nshook his head. “Farthen Dûr protects us from the elements. Neither rain nor \\nsnow intrude here. Besides, the hold’s walls are lined with marble caves for \\ndragons. They provide all the shelter necessary. All you need fear are the \\nicicles; when they fall they’ve been known to cleave a horse in two.”\\nI will be fine,assured Saphira.A \\nmarble cave is safer than any of the other places we’ve stayed.\\nPerhaps . . . Do \\nyou think Murtagh will be all right? \\nAjihad strikes \\nme as an honorable man. Unless Murtagh tries to escape, I doubt he will be \\nharmed.\\n\\nEragon crossed \\nhis arms, unwilling to talk further. He was dazed by the change in \\ncircumstances from the day before. Their mad race from Gil’ead was finally \\nover, but his body expected to continue running and riding. “Where are our \\nhorses?”\\n“In the stables \\nby the gate. We can visit them before leaving Tronjheim.”\\n\\xa0\\nThey exited \\nTronjheim through the same gate they had entered. The gold griffins gleamed with \\ncolored highlights garnered from scores of lanterns. The sun had moved during \\nEragon’s talk with Ajihad—light no longer entered Farthen Dûr through the \\ncrater opening. Without those moted rays, the inside of the hollow mountain was \\nvelvety black. The only illumination came from Tronjheim, which sparkled \\nbrilliantly in the gloom. The city-mountain’s radiance was enough to brighten \\nthe ground hundreds of feet away.\\nOrik pointed at \\nTronjheim’s white pinnacle. “Fresh meat and pure mountain water await you up there,” \\nhe told Saphira. “You may stay in any of the caves. Once you make your choice, \\nbedding will be laid down in it and then no one will disturb you.”\\n“I thought we \\nwere going to go together. I don’t want to be separated,” protested Eragon.\\nOrik turned to \\nhim. “Rider Eragon, I will do everything to accommodate you, but it would be \\nbest if Saphira waits in the dragonhold while you eat. The tunnels to the \\nbanquet halls aren’t large enough for her to accompany us.”\\n“Why can’t you \\njust bring me food in the hold?”\\n“Because,” said \\nOrik with a guarded expression, “the food is prepared down here, and it is a \\nlong way to the top. If you wish, a servant could be sent up to the hold with a \\nmeal for you. It will take some time, but you could eat with Saphira then.”\\nHe actually \\nmeans it,Eragon \\nthought, astonished that they would do so much for him. But the way Orik said \\nit made him wonder if the dwarf was testing him somehow.\\nI’m weary,said Saphira.And \\nthis dragonhold sounds to my liking. Go, have your meal, then come to me. It \\nwill be soothing to rest together without fear of wild animals or soldiers. We \\nhave suffered the hardships of the trail too long.\\nEragon looked at \\nher thoughtfully, then said to Orik, “I’ll eat down here.” The dwarf smiled, \\nseeming satisfied. Eragon unstrapped Saphira’s saddle so she could lie down \\nwithout discomfort.Would you take Zar’roc with you?\\nYes,she said, \\ngathering up the sword and saddle with her claws.But keep your bow. We must \\ntrust these people, though not to the point of foolishness.\\nI know,he said, \\ndisquieted.\\nWith an \\nexplosive leap Saphira swept off the ground and into the still air. The steady \\nwhoosh of her wings was the only sound in the darkness. As she disappeared over \\nthe rim of Tronjheim’s peak, Orik let out a long breath. “Ah boy, you have been \\nblessed indeed. I find a sudden longing in my heart for open skies and soaring \\ncliffs and the thrill of hunting like a hawk. Still, my feet are better on the \\nground—preferably under it.”\\nHe clapped his \\nhands loudly. “I neglect my duties as host. I know you’ve not dined since that \\npitiful dinner the Twins saw fit to give you, so come, let’s find the cooks and \\nbeg meat and bread from them!”\\nEragon followed \\nthe dwarf back into Tronjheim and through a labyrinth of corridors until they \\ncame to a long room filled with rows of stone tables only high enough for \\ndwarves. Fires blazed in soapstone ovens behind a long counter.\\nOrik spoke words \\nin an unfamiliar language to a stout ruddy-faced dwarf, who promptly handed \\nthem stone platters piled with steaming mushrooms and fish. Then Orik took \\nEragon up several flights of stairs and into a small alcove carved out of \\nTronjheim’s outer wall, where they sat cross-legged. Eragon wordlessly reached \\nfor his food.\\nWhen their \\nplatters were empty, Orik sighed with contentment and pulled out a long-stemmed \\npipe. He lit it, saying, “A worthy repast, though it needed a good draught of \\nmead to wash it down properly.”\\nEragon surveyed \\nthe ground below. “Do you farm in Farthen Dûr?”\\n“No, there’s \\nonly enough sunlight for moss, mushrooms, and mold. Tronjheim cannot survive \\nwithout supplies from the surrounding valleys, which is one reason why many of \\nus choose to live elsewhere in the Beor Mountains.”\\n“Then there are \\nother dwarf cities?”\\n“Not as many as \\nwe would like. And Tronjheim is the greatest of them.” Leaning on an elbow, \\nOrik took a deep pull on his pipe. “You have only seen the lower levels, so it \\nhasn’t been apparent, but most of Tronjheim is deserted. The farther up you go, \\nthe emptier it gets. Entire floors have remained untouched for centuries. Most \\ndwarves prefer to dwell under Tronjheim and Farthen Dûr in the caverns and \\npassageways that riddle the rock. Through the centuries we have tunneled \\nextensively under the Beor Mountains. It is possible to walk from one end of \\nthe mountain range to the other without ever setting foot on the surface.”\\n“It seems like a \\nwaste to have all that unused space in Tronjheim,” commented Eragon.\\nOrik nodded. \\n“Some have argued for abandoning this place because of its drain on our \\nresources, but Tronjheim does perform one invaluable task.”\\n“What’s that?”\\n“In times of \\nmisfortune it can house our entire nation. There have been only three instances \\nin our history when we have been forced to that extreme, but each time it has saved \\nus from certain and utter destruction. That is why we always keep it \\ngarrisoned, ready for use.”\\n“I’ve never seen \\nanything as magnificent,” admitted Eragon.\\nOrik smiled \\naround his pipe. “I’m glad you find it so. It took generations to build \\nTronjheim—and our lives are much longer than those of men. Unfortunately, \\nbecause of the cursed Empire, few outsiders are allowed to see its glory.”\\n“How many Varden \\nare here?”\\n“Dwarves or \\nhumans?”\\n“Humans—I want \\nto know how many have fled the Empire.”\\nOrik exhaled a \\nlong puff of smoke that coiled lazily around his head. “There are about four \\nthousand of your kin here. But that’s a poor indicator of what you want to \\nknow. Only people who wish to fight come here. The rest of them are under King \\nOrrin’s protection in Surda.”\\nSo few?thought Eragon \\nwith a sinking feeling. The royal army alone numbered nearly sixteen thousand \\nwhen it was fully marshaled, not counting the Urgals. “Why doesn’t Orrin fight \\nthe Empire himself?” he asked.\\n“If he were to \\nshow open hostility,” said Orik, “Galbatorix would crush him. As it is, \\nGalbatorix withholds that destruction because he considers Surda a minor \\nthreat, which is a mistake. It’s through Orrin’s assistance that the Varden \\nhave most of their weapons and supplies. Without him, there would be no \\nresisting the Empire.\\n“Don’t despair \\nover the number of humans in Tronjheim. There are many dwarves here—many more \\nthan you have seen—and all will fight when the time comes. Orrin has also \\npromised us troops for when we battle Galbatorix. The elves pledged their help \\nas well.”\\nEragon absently \\ntouched Saphira’s mind and found her busy eating a bloody haunch with gusto. He \\nnoticed once more the hammer and stars engraved on Orik’s helm. “What does that \\nmean? I saw it on the floor in Tronjheim.”\\nOrik lifted the \\niron-bound cap off his head and brushed a rough finger over the engraving. “It \\nis the symbol of my clan. We are the Ingietum, metalworkers and master smiths. \\nThe hammer and stars are inlaid into Tronjheim’s floor because it was the \\npersonal crest of Korgan, our founder. One clan to rule, with twelve \\nsurrounding. King Hrothgar is Dûrgrimst Ingietum as well and has brought my \\nhouse much glory, much honor.”\\nWhen they \\nreturned the platters to the cook, they passed a dwarf in the hall. He stopped before \\nEragon, bowed, and said respectfully, “Argetlam.”\\nThe dwarf left \\nEragon fumbling for an answer, flushed with unease, yet also strangely pleased \\nwith the gesture. No one had bowed to him before. “What did he say?” he asked, \\nleaning closer to Orik.\\nOrik shrugged, \\nembarrassed. “It’s an elven word that was used to refer to the Riders. It means \\n‘silver hand.’ ” Eragon glanced at his gloved hand, thinking of the gedwëy \\nignasia that whitened his palm. “Do you wish to return to Saphira?”\\n“Is there \\nsomewhere I could bathe first? I haven’t been able to wash off the grime of the \\nroad for a long time. Also, my shirt is bloodstained and torn, and it stinks. \\nI’d like to replace it, but I don’t have any money to buy a new one. Is there a \\nway I could work for one?”\\n“Do you seek to \\ninsult Hrothgar’s hospitality, Eragon?” demanded Orik. “As long as you are in \\nTronjheim, you won’t have to buy a thing. You’ll pay for it in other \\nways—Ajihad and Hrothgar will see to that. Come. I’ll show you where to wash, \\nthen fetch you a shirt.”\\nHe took Eragon \\ndown a long staircase until they were well below Tronjheim. The corridors were \\ntunnels now—which cramped Eragon because they were only five feet high—and all \\nthe lanterns were red. “So the light doesn’t blind you when you leave or enter \\na dark cavern,” explained Orik.\\nThey entered a \\nbare room with a small door on the far side. Orik pointed. “The pools are \\nthrough there, along with brushes and soap. Leave your clothes here. I’ll have \\nnew ones waiting when you get out.”\\nEragon thanked \\nhim and started to undress. It felt oppressive being alone underground, \\nespecially with the low rock ceiling. He stripped quickly and, cold, hurried \\nthrough the door, into total darkness. He inched forward until his foot touched \\nwarm water, then eased himself into it.\\nThe pool was \\nmildly salty, but soothing and calm. For a moment he was afraid of drifting \\naway from the door, into deeper water, but as he waded forward, he discovered \\nthe water reached only to his waist. He groped over a slippery wall until he \\nfound the soap and brushes, then scrubbed himself. Afterward he floated with \\nhis eyes closed, enjoying the warmth.\\nWhen he emerged, \\ndripping, into the lighted room, he found a towel, a fine linen shirt, and a \\npair of breeches. The clothes fit him reasonably well. Satisfied, he went out \\ninto the tunnel.\\nOrik was waiting \\nfor him, pipe in hand. They climbed the stairs back up into Tronjheim, then \\nexited the city-mountain. Eragon gazed at Tronjheim’s peak and called Saphira \\nwith his mind. As she flew down from the dragonhold, he asked, “How do you \\ncommunicate with people at the top of Tronjheim?”\\nOrik chuckled. \\n“That’s a problem we solved long ago. You didn’t notice, but behind the open \\narches that line each level is a single, unbroken staircase that spirals around \\nthe wall of Tronjheim’s central chamber. The stairs climb all the way to the \\ndragonhold above Isidar Mithrim. We call it Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. \\nRunning up or down it isn’t swift enough for an emergency, nor convenient \\nenough for casual use. Instead, we use flashing lanterns to convey messages. \\nThere is another way too, though it is seldom used. When Vol Turin was \\nconstructed, a polished trough was cut next to it. The trough acts as a giant \\nslide as high as a mountain.”\\nEragon’s lips \\ntwitched with a smile. “Is it dangerous?”\\n“Do not think of \\ntrying it. The slide was built for dwarves and is too narrow for a man. If you \\nslipped out of it, you could be thrown onto the stairs and against the arches, \\nperhaps even into empty space.”\\nSaphira landed a \\nspear’s throw away, her scales rustling dryly. As she greeted Eragon, humans \\nand dwarves trickled out of Tronjheim, gathering around her with murmurs of \\ninterest. Eragon regarded the growing crowd uneasily. “You’d better go,” said \\nOrik, pushing him forward. “Meet me by this gate tomorrow morning. I’ll be \\nwaiting.”\\nEragon balked. \\n“How will I know when it’s morning?”\\n“I’ll have \\nsomeone wake you. Now go!” Without further protest, Eragon slipped through the \\njostling group that surrounded Saphira and jumped onto her back.\\nBefore she could \\ntake off, an old woman stepped forward and grasped Eragon’s foot with a fierce \\ngrip. He tried to pull away, but her hand was like an iron talon around his \\nankle—he could not break her tenacious hold. The burning gray eyes she fixed on \\nhim were surrounded by a lifetime’s worth of wrinkles—the skin was folded in \\nlong creases down her sunken cheeks. A tattered bundle rested in the crook of \\nher left arm.\\nFrightened, \\nEragon asked, “What do you want?”\\nThe woman tilted \\nher arm, and a cloth fell from the bundle, revealing a baby’s face. Hoarse and \\ndesperate, she said, “The child has no parents—there is no one to care for her \\nbut me, and I am weak. Bless her with your power, Argetlam. Bless her for \\nluck!”\\nEragon looked to \\nOrik for help, but the dwarf only watched with a guarded expression. The small \\ncrowd fell silent, waiting for his response. The woman’s eyes were still \\nfastened on him. “Bless her, Argetlam, bless her,” she insisted.\\nEragon had never \\nblessed anyone. It was not something done lightly in Alagaësia, as a blessing \\ncould easily go awry and prove to be more curse than boon—especially if it was \\nspoken with ill intent or lack of conviction.Do I dare take that \\nresponsibility? he wondered.\\n“Bless her, Argetlam, \\nbless her.”\\nSuddenly \\ndecided, he searched for a phrase or expression to use. Nothing came to mind \\nuntil, inspired, he thought of the ancient language. This would be a true \\nblessing, spoken with words of power, by one of power.\\nHe bent down and \\ntugged the glove off his right hand. Laying his palm on the babe’s brow, he \\nintoned, “Atra gülai un ilian tauthr ono un atra ono waíse skölir frá rauthr.” \\nThe words left him unexpectedly weak, as if he had used magic. He slowly pulled \\nthe glove back on and said to the woman, “That is all I can do for her. If any \\nwords have the power to forestall tragedy, it will be those.”\\n“Thank you, \\nArgetlam,” she whispered, bowing slightly. She started to cover the baby again, \\nbut Saphira snorted and twisted until her head loomed over the child. The woman \\ngrew rigid; her breath caught in her chest. Saphira lowered her snout and \\nbrushed the baby between the eyes with the tip of her nose, then smoothly \\nlifted away.\\nA gasp ran \\nthrough the crowd, for on the child’s forehead, where Saphira had touched her, \\nwas a star-shaped patch of skin as white and silvery as Eragon’s gedwëy \\nignasia. The woman stared at Saphira with a feverish gaze, wordless thanks in \\nher eyes.\\nImmediately \\nSaphira took flight, battering the awestruck spectators with the wind from her \\npowerful wing strokes. As the ground dwindled away, Eragon took a deep breath \\nand hugged her neck tightly.What did you do? he asked softly.\\nI gave her hope. \\nAnd you gave her a future. \\nLoneliness \\nsuddenly flowered within Eragon, despite Saphira’s presence. Their surroundings \\nwere so foreign—it struck him for the first time exactly how far he was from \\nhome. A destroyed home, but still where his heart lay.What have I become, \\nSaphira? he asked.I’m only in the first year of manhood, yet I’ve \\nconsulted with the leader of the Varden, am pursued by Galbatorix, and have \\ntraveled with Morzan’s son—and now blessings are sought from me! What wisdom \\ncan I give people that they haven’t already learned? What feats can I achieve \\nthat an army couldn’t do better? It’s insanity! I should be back in Carvahall \\nwith Roran.\\nSaphira took a \\nlong time to answer, but her words were gentle when they came.A hatchling, \\nthat is what you are. A hatchling struggling into the world. I may be younger \\nthan you in years, but I am ancient in my thoughts. Do not worry about these \\nthings. Find peace in where and what you are. People often know what must be \\ndone. All you need do is show them the way—that is wisdom. As for feats, no \\narmy could have given the blessing you did.\\nBut it was \\nnothing,he \\nprotested.A trifle.\\nNay, it wasn’t. \\nWhat you saw was the beginning of another story, another legend. Do you think \\nthat child will ever be content to be a tavern keeper or a farmer when her brow \\nis dragon-marked and your words hang over her? You underestimate our power and \\nthat of fate.\\n\\nEragon bowed his \\nhead.It’s overwhelming. I feel as if I am living in an illusion, a dream \\nwhere all things are possible. Amazing things do happen, I know, but always to \\nsomeone else, always in some far-off place and time. But I found your egg, was \\ntutored by a Rider, and dueled a Shade—those can’t be the actions of the farm \\nboy I am, or was. Something is changing me.\\nIt is your wyrd \\nthat shapes you,said \\nSaphira.Every age needs an icon—perhaps that lot has fallen to you. Farm \\nboys are not named for the first Rider without cause. Your namesake was the \\nbeginning, and now you are the continuation. Or the end.\\nAch,said Eragon, \\nshaking his head.It’s like speaking in riddles. . . . But if all is \\nforeordained, do our choices mean anything? Or must we just learn to accept our \\nfate?\\nSaphira said \\nfirmly,Eragon, I chose you from within my egg. You have been given a chance \\nmost would die for. Are you unhappy with that? Clear your mind of such \\nthoughts. They cannot be answered and will make you no happier.\\nTrue,he said glumly.All \\nthe same, they continue to bounce around within my skull.\\nThings have been \\n. . . unsettled . . . ever since Brom died. It has made me uneasy,acknowledged \\nSaphira, which surprised him because she rarely seemed perturbed. They were \\nabove Tronjheim now. Eragon looked down through the opening in its peak and saw \\nthe floor of the dragonhold: Isidar Mithrim, the great star sapphire. He knew that \\nbeneath it was nothing but Tronjheim’s great central chamber. Saphira descended \\nto the dragonhold on silent wings. She slipped over its rim and dropped to \\nIsidar Mithrim, landing with the sharp clack of claws.\\nWon’t you \\nscratch it?asked \\nEragon.\\nI think not. \\nIt’s no ordinary gem.Eragon \\nslid off her back and slowly turned in a circle, absorbing the unusual sight. \\nThey were in a round roofless room sixty feet high and sixty feet across. The \\nwalls were lined with the dark openings of caves, which differed in size from \\ngrottoes no larger than a man to a gaping cavern larger than a house. Shiny \\nrungs were set into the marble walls so that people could reach the highest \\ncaves. An enormous archway led out of the dragonhold.\\nEragon examined \\nthe great gem under his feet and impulsively lay down on it. He pressed his \\ncheek against the cool sapphire, trying to see through it. Distorted lines and \\nwavering spots of color glimmered through the stone, but its thickness made it \\nimpossible to discern anything clearly on the floor of the chamber a mile below \\nthem.\\nWill I have to \\nsleep apart from you?\\n\\nSaphira shook \\nher enormous head.No, there is a bed for you in my cave. Come see. She \\nturned and, without opening her wings, jumped twenty feet into the air, landing \\nin a medium-sized cave. He clambered up after her.\\nThe cave was \\ndark brown on the inside and deeper than he had expected. The roughly chiseled \\nwalls gave the impression of a natural formation. Near the far wall was a thick \\ncushion large enough for Saphira to curl up on. Beside it was a bed built into \\nthe side of the wall. The cave was lit by a single red lantern equipped with a \\nshutter so its glow could be muted.\\nI like this,said Eragon.It \\nfeels safe.\\nYes.Saphira curled \\nup on the cushion, watching him. With a sigh he sank onto the mattress, \\nweariness seeping through him.\\nSaphira, you \\nhaven’t said much while we’ve been here. What do you think of Tronjheim and \\nAjihad?\\n\\nWe shall see. . \\n. . It seems, Eragon, that we are embroiled in a new type of warfare here. \\nSwords and claws are useless, but words and alliances may have the same effect. \\nThe Twins dislike us—we should be on our guard for any duplicities they might \\nattempt. Not many of the dwarves trust us. The elves didn’t want a human Rider, \\nso there will be opposition from them as well. The best thing we can do is \\nidentify those in power and befriend them. And quickly, too. \\nDo you think \\nit’s possible to remain independent of the different leaders? \\nShe shuffled her \\nwings into a more comfortable position.Ajihad supports our freedom, but we \\nmay be unable to survive without pledging our loyalty to one group or another. \\nWe’ll soon know either way.\\nM ANDRAKEROOTANDNEWT’STONGUE\\nThe blankets were \\nbunched underneath Eragon when he woke, but he was still warm. Saphira was \\nasleep on her cushion, her breath coming in steady gusts.\\nFor the first \\ntime since entering Farthen Dûr, Eragon felt secure and hopeful. He was warm \\nand fed and had been able to sleep as long as he liked. Tension unknotted \\ninside him—tension that had been accumulating since Brom’s death and, even \\nbefore, since leaving Palancar Valley.\\nI don’t have to \\nbe afraid anymore. But what about Murtagh?No matter the Varden’s \\nhospitality, Eragon could not accept it in good conscience, knowing \\nthat—intentionally or not—he had led Murtagh to his imprisonment. Somehow the \\nsituation had to be resolved.\\nHis gaze roamed \\nthe cave’s rough ceiling as he thought of Arya. Chiding himself for \\ndaydreaming, he tilted his head and looked out at the dragonhold. A large cat \\nsat on the edge of the cave, licking a paw. It glanced at him, and he saw a \\nflash of slanted red eyes.\\nSolembum?he asked \\nincredulously.\\nObviously.The werecat \\nshook his rough mane and yawned languorously, displaying his long fangs. He \\nstretched, then jumped out of the cave, landing with a solid thump on Isidar \\nMithrim, twenty feet below.Coming?\\nEragon looked at \\nSaphira. She was awake now, watching him motionlessly.Go. I will be fine, \\nshe murmured. Solembum was waiting for him under the arch that led to the rest \\nof Tronjheim.\\nThe moment \\nEragon’s feet touched Isidar Mithrim, the werecat turned with a flick of his \\npaws and disappeared through the arch. Eragon chased after him, rubbing the \\nsleep from his face. He stepped through the archway and found himself standing \\nat the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. There was nowhere else to go, \\nso he descended to the next level.\\nHe stood in an \\nopen arcade that curved gently to the left and encircled Tronjheim’s central \\nchamber. Between the slender columns supporting the arches, Eragon could see \\nIsidar Mithrim sparkling brilliantly above him, as well as the city-mountain’s \\ndistant base. The circumference of the central chamber increased with each \\nsuccessive level. The staircase cut through the arcade’s floor to an identical \\nlevel below and descended through scores of arcades until it disappeared in the \\ndistance. The sliding trough ran along the outside curve of the stairs. At the \\ntop of Vol Turin was a pile of leather squares to slide on. To Eragon’s right, \\na dusty corridor led to that level’s rooms and apartments. Solembum padded down \\nthe hall, flipping his tail.\\nWait,said Eragon.\\nHe tried to \\ncatch up with Solembum, but glimpsed him only fleetingly in the abandoned \\npassageways. Then, as Eragon rounded a corner, he saw the werecat stop before a \\ndoor and yowl. Seemingly of its own accord, the door slid inward. Solembum \\nslipped inside, then the door shut. Eragon halted in front of it, perplexed. He \\nraised his hand to knock, but before he did, the door opened once more, and \\nwarm light spilled out. After a moment’s indecision he stepped inside.\\nHe entered an \\nearthy two-room suite, lavishly decorated with carved wood and clinging plants. \\nThe air was warm, fresh, and humid. Bright lanterns hung on the walls and from \\nthe low ceiling. Piles of intriguing items cluttered the floor, obscuring the \\ncorners. A large four-poster bed, curtained by even more plants, was in the far \\nroom.\\nIn the center of \\nthe main room, on a plush leather chair, sat the fortuneteller and witch, \\nAngela. She smiled brightly.\\n“What are you \\ndoing here?” blurted Eragon.\\nAngela folded \\nher hands in her lap. “Well, why don’t you sit on the floor and I’ll tell you? \\nI’d offer you a chair, but I’m sitting on the only one.” Questions buzzed \\nthrough Eragon’s mind as he settled between two flasks of acrid bubbling green \\npotions.\\n“So!” exclaimed \\nAngela, leaning forward. “Youare a Rider. I suspected as much, but I \\ndidn’t know for certain until yesterday. I’m sure Solembum knew, but he never \\ntold me. I should have figured it out the moment you mentioned Brom. Saphira . \\n. . I like the name—fitting for a dragon.”\\n“Brom’s dead,” \\nsaid Eragon abruptly. “The Ra’zac killed him.”\\nAngela was taken \\naback. She twirled a lock of her dense curls. “I’m sorry. I truly am,” she said \\nsoftly.\\nEragon smiled bitterly. \\n“But not surprised, are you? You foretold his death, after all.”\\n“I didn’t know \\nwhose death it would be,” she said, shaking her head. “But no . . . I’m not \\nsurprised. I met Brom once or twice. He didn’t care for my ‘frivolous’ attitude \\ntoward magic. It irritated him.”\\nEragon frowned. \\n“In Teirm you laughed at his fate and said that it was something of a joke. \\nWhy?”\\nAngela’s face \\ntightened momentarily. “In retrospect, it was in rather bad taste, but I didn’t \\nknow what would befall him. How do I put this? . . . Brom was cursed in a way. \\nIt was his wyrd to fail at all of his tasks except one, although through no \\nfault of his own. He was chosen as a Rider, but his dragon was killed. He loved \\na woman, but it was his affection that was her undoing. And he was chosen, I \\nassume, to guard and train you, but in the end he failed at that as well. The \\nonly thing he succeeded at was killing Morzan, and a better deed he couldn’t \\nhave done.”\\n“Brom never \\nmentioned a woman to me,” retorted Eragon.\\nAngela shrugged \\ncarelessly. “I heard it from one who couldn’t have lied. But enough of this \\ntalk! Life goes on, and we should not trouble the dead with our worries.” She \\nscooped a pile of reeds from the floor and deftly started plaiting them \\ntogether, closing the subject to discussion.\\nEragon \\nhesitated, then gave in. “All right. So why are you in Tronjheim instead of \\nTeirm?”\\n“Ah, at last an \\ninteresting question,” said Angela. “After hearing Brom’s name again during \\nyour visit, I sensed a return of the past in Alagaësia. People were whispering \\nthat the Empire was hunting a Rider. I knew then that the Varden’s dragon egg \\nmust have hatched, so I closed my shop and set out to learn more.”\\n“You knew about \\nthe egg?”\\n“Of course I \\ndid. I’m not an idiot. I’ve been around much longer than you would believe. \\nVery little happens that I don’t know about.” She paused and concentrated on \\nher weaving. “Anyway, I knew I had to get to the Varden as fast as possible. \\nI’ve been here for nearly a month now, though I really don’t care for this \\nplace—it’s far too musty for my taste. And everyone in Farthen Dûr isso \\nserious and noble. They’re probably all doomed to tragic deaths anyway.” She \\ngave a long sigh, a mocking expression on her face. “And the dwarves are just a \\nsuperstitious bunch of ninnies content to hammer rocks all their lives. The \\nonly redeeming aspect of this place is all the mushrooms and fungi that grow \\ninside Farthen Dûr.”\\n“Then why stay?” \\nasked Eragon, smiling.\\n“Because I like \\nto be wherever important events are occurring,” said Angela, cocking her head. \\n“Besides, if I had stayed in Teirm, Solembum would have left without me, and I \\nenjoy his company. But tell me, what adventures have befallen you since last we \\ntalked?”\\nFor the next \\nhour, Eragon summarized his experiences of the last two and a half months. \\nAngela listened quietly, but when he mentioned Murtagh’s name she sputtered, \\n“Murtagh!”\\nEragon nodded. \\n“He told me who he is. But let me finish my story before you make any \\njudgments.” He continued with his tale. When it was complete, Angela leaned \\nback in her chair thoughtfully, her reeds forgotten. Without warning, Solembum \\njumped out of a hiding place and landed in her lap. He curled up, eyeing Eragon \\nhaughtily.\\nAngela petted \\nthe werecat. “Fascinating. Galbatorix allied with the Urgals, and Murtagh \\nfinally out in the open. . . . I’d warn you to be careful with Murtagh, but \\nyou’re obviously aware of the danger.”\\n“Murtagh has \\nbeen a steadfast friend and an unwavering ally,” said Eragon firmly.\\n“All the same, \\nbe careful.” Angela paused, then said distastefully, “And then there’s the \\nmatter of this Shade, Durza. I think he’s the greatest threat to the Varden \\nright now, aside from Galbatorix. Iloathe Shades—they practice the most \\nunholy magic, after necromancy. I’d like to dig his heart out with a dull \\nhairpin and feed it to a pig!”\\nEragon was \\nstartled by her sudden vehemence. “I don’t understand. Brom told me that Shades \\nwere sorcerers who used spirits to accomplish their will, but why does that \\nmake them so evil?”\\nAngela shook her \\nhead. “It doesn’t. Ordinary sorcerers are just that, ordinary—neither better \\nnor worse than the rest of us. They use their magical strength to control \\nspirits and the spirits’ powers. Shades, however, relinquish that control in \\ntheir search for greater power and allow their bodies to be controlledby \\nspirits. Unfortunately, only the evilest spirits seek to possess humans, and \\nonce ensconced they never leave. Such possession can happen by accident if a \\nsorcerer summons a spirit stronger than himself. The problem is, once a Shade \\nis created, it’s terribly difficult to kill. As I’m sure you know, only two \\npeople, Laetri the Elf and Irnstad the Rider, ever survived that feat.”\\n“I’ve heard the \\nstories.” Eragon gestured at the room. “Why are you living so high up in \\nTronjheim? Isn’t it inconvenient being this isolated? And how did you get all \\nthis stuff up here?”\\nAngela threw \\nback her head and laughed wryly. “Truthfully? I’m in hiding. When I first came \\nto Tronjheim, I had a few days of peace—until one of guards who let me into \\nFarthen Dûr blabbed about who I was. Then all the magic users here, though theybarely \\nrate the term, pestered me to join their secret group. Especially those drajl \\nTwins who control it. Finally, I threatened to turn the lot of them into toads, \\nexcuse me, frogs, but when that didn’t deter them, I sneaked up here in the \\nmiddle of the night. It was less work than you might imagine, especially for \\none with my skills.”\\n“Did you have to \\nlet the Twins into your mind before you were allowed into Farthen Dûr?” asked \\nEragon. “I was forced to let them sift through my memories.”\\nA cold gleam \\nleapt into Angela’s eye. “The Twins wouldn’t dare probe me, for fear of what I \\nmight do to them. Oh, they’d love to, but they know the effort would leave them \\nbroken and gibbering nonsense. I’ve been coming here long before the Varden \\nbegan examining people’s minds . . . and they’re not about to start on me now.”\\nShe peered into \\nthe other room and said, “Well! This has been an enlightening talk, but I’m \\nafraid you have to go now. My brew of mandrake root and newt’s tongue is about \\nto boil, and it needs attending. Do come back again when you have the time. Andplease \\ndon’t tell anyone that I’m here. I’d hate to have to move again. It would make \\nme very . . .irritated. And you don’t want to see me irritated!”\\n“I’ll keep your \\nsecret,” assured Eragon, getting up.\\nSolembum jumped \\noff Angela’s lap as she stood. “Good!” she exclaimed.\\nEragon said \\nfarewell and left the room. Solembum guided him back to the dragonhold, then \\ndismissed him with a twitch of his tail before sauntering away.\\nH ALL OF \\nTHE\\n \\nMOUNTAINKING\\nAdwarf was \\nwaiting for Eragon in the dragonhold. After bowing and muttering, “Argetlam,” \\nthe dwarf said with a thick accent, “Good. Awake. Knurla Orik waits for you.” \\nHe bowed again and scurried away. Saphira jumped out of her cave, landing next \\nto Eragon. Zar’roc was in her claws.\\nWhat’s that for?he asked, \\nfrowning.\\nShe tilted her \\nhead.Wear it. You are a Rider and should bear a Rider’s sword. Zar’roc may \\nhave a bloody history, but that should not shape your actions. Forge a new \\nhistory for it, and carry it with pride.\\nAre you \\nsure?Remember Ajihad’s counsel. \\nSaphira snorted, \\nand a puff of smoke rose from her nostrils.Wear it, Eragon. If you wish to \\nremain above the forces here, do not let anyone’s disapproval dictate your \\nactions.\\nAs you wish,he said \\nreluctantly, buckling on the sword. He clambered onto her back, and Saphira \\nflew out of Tronjheim. There was enough light in Farthen Dûr now that the hazy \\nmass of the crater walls—five miles away in each direction—was visible. While \\nthey spiraled down to the city-mountain’s base, Eragon told Saphira about his \\nmeeting with Angela.\\nAs soon as they \\nlanded by one of Tronjheim’s gates, Orik ran to Saphira’s side. “My king, \\nHrothgar, wishes to see both of you. Dismount quickly. We must hurry.”\\nEragon trotted \\nafter the dwarf into Tronjheim. Saphira easily kept pace beside them. Ignoring \\nstares from people within the soaring corridor, Eragon asked, “Where will we \\nmeet Hrothgar?”\\nWithout slowing, \\nOrik said, “In the throne room beneath the city. It will be a private audience \\nas an act of otho—of ‘faith.’ You do not have to address him in any special \\nmanner, but speak to him respectfully. Hrothgar is quick to anger, but he is \\nwise and sees keenly into the minds of men, so think carefully before you \\nspeak.”\\nOnce they \\nentered Tronjheim’s central chamber, Orik led the way to one of the two \\ndescending stairways that flanked the opposite hall. They started down the \\nright-hand staircase, which gently curved inward until it faced the direction \\nthey had come from. The other stairway merged with theirs to form a broad \\ncascade of dimly lit steps that ended, after a hundred feet, before two granite \\ndoors. A seven-pointed crown was carved across both doors.\\nSeven dwarves \\nstood guard on each side of the portal. They held burnished mattocks and wore \\ngem-encrusted belts. As Eragon, Orik, and Saphira approached, the dwarves \\npounded the floor with the mattocks’ hafts. A deep boom rolled back up the \\nstairs. The doors swung inward.\\nA dark hall lay \\nbefore them, a good bowshot long. The throne room was a natural cave; the walls \\nwere lined with stalagmites and stalactites, each thicker than a man. Sparsely \\nhung lanterns cast a moody light. The brown floor was smooth and polished. At \\nthe far end of the hall was a black throne with a motionless figure upon it.\\nOrik bowed. “The \\nking awaits you.” Eragon put his hand on Saphira’s side, and the two of them \\ncontinued forward. The doors closed behind them, leaving them alone in the dim \\nthrone room with the king.\\nTheir footsteps \\nechoed through the hall as they advanced toward the throne. In the recesses \\nbetween the stalagmites and stalactites rested large statues. Each sculpture \\ndepicted a dwarf king crowned and sitting on a throne; their sightless eyes \\ngazed sternly into the distance, their lined faces set in fierce expressions. A \\nname was chiseled in runes beneath each set of feet.\\nEragon and \\nSaphira strode solemnly between the two rows of long-dead monarchs. They passed \\nmore than forty statues, then only dark and empty alcoves awaiting future \\nkings. They stopped before Hrothgar at the end of the hall.\\nThe dwarf king \\nhimself sat like a statue upon a raised throne carved from a single piece of black \\nmarble. It was blocky, unadorned, and cut with unyielding precision. Strength \\nemanated from the throne, strength that harked back to ancient times when \\ndwarves had ruled in Alagaësia without opposition from elves or humans. A gold \\nhelm lined with rubies and diamonds rested on Hrothgar’s head in place of a \\ncrown. His visage was grim, weathered, and hewn of many years’ experience. \\nBeneath a craggy brow glinted deep-set eyes, flinty and piercing. Over his \\npowerful chest rippled a shirt of mail. His white beard was tucked under his \\nbelt, and in his lap he held a mighty war hammer with the symbol of Orik’s clan \\nembossed on its head.\\nEragon bowed \\nawkwardly and knelt. Saphira remained upright. The king stirred, as if \\nawakening from a long sleep, and rumbled, “Rise, Rider, you need not pay \\ntribute to me.”\\nStraightening, \\nEragon met Hrothgar’s impenetrable eyes. The king inspected him with a hard \\ngaze, then said gutturally, “Âz knurl deimi lanok.‘Beware, the rock \\nchanges’—an old dictum of ours. . . . And nowadays the rock changes very fast \\nindeed.” He fingered the war hammer. “I could not meet with you earlier, as \\nAjihad did, because I was forced to deal with my enemies within the clans. They \\ndemanded that I deny you sanctuary and expel you from Farthen Dûr. It has taken \\nmuch work on my part to convince them otherwise.”\\n“Thank you,” \\nsaid Eragon. “I didn’t anticipate how much strife my arrival would cause.”\\nThe king \\naccepted his thanks, then lifted a gnarled hand and pointed. “See there, Rider \\nEragon, where my predecessors sit upon their graven thrones. One and forty \\nthere are, with I the forty-second. When I pass from this world into the care \\nof the gods, my hírna will be added to their ranks. The first statue is the \\nlikeness of my ancestor Korgan, who forged this mace, Volund. For eight \\nmillennia—since the dawn of our race—dwarves have ruled under Farthen Dûr. We \\nare the bones of the land, older than both the fair elves and the savage \\ndragons.” Saphira shifted slightly.\\nHrothgar leaned \\nforward, his voice gravelly and deep. “I am old, human—even by our \\nreckoning—old enough to have seen the Riders in all their fleeting glory, old \\nenough to have spoken with their last leader, Vrael, who paid tribute to me \\nwithin these very walls. Few are still alive who can claim that much. I \\nremember the Riders and how they meddled in our affairs. I also remember the \\npeace they kept that made it possible to walk unharmed from Tronjheim to Narda.\\n“And now you \\nstand before me—a lost tradition revived. Tell me, and speak truly in this, why \\nhave you come to Farthen Dûr? I know of the events that made you flee the \\nEmpire, but what is your intent now?”\\n“For now, \\nSaphira and I merely want to recuperate in Tronjheim,” Eragon replied. “We are \\nnot here to cause trouble, only to find sanctuary from the dangers we’ve faced \\nfor many months. Ajihad may send us to the elves, but until he does, we have no \\nwish to leave.”\\n“Then was it \\nonly the desire for safety that drove you?” asked Hrothgar. “Do you just seek \\nto live here and forget your troubles with the Empire?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, his pride rejecting that statement. “If Ajihad told you of my past, you \\nshould know that I have grievances enough to fight the Empire until it is \\nnothing but scattered ashes. More than that, though . . . I want to aid those \\nwho cannot escape Galbatorix, including my cousin. I have the strength to help, \\nso I must.”\\nThe king seemed \\nsatisfied by his answer. He turned to Saphira and asked, “Dragon, what think \\nyou in this matter? For what reason have you come?”\\nSaphira lifted \\nthe edge of her lip to growl.Tell him that I thirst for the blood of our \\nenemies and eagerly await the day when we ride to battle against Galbatorix. \\nI’ve no love or mercy for traitors and egg breakers like that false king. He \\nheld me for over a century and, even now, still has two of my brethren, whom I \\nwould free if possible. And tell Hrothgar I think you ready for this task.\\nEragon grimaced \\nat her words, but dutifully relayed them. The corner of Hrothgar’s mouth lifted \\nin a hint of grim amusement, deepening his wrinkles. “I see that dragons have \\nnot changed with the centuries.” He rapped the throne with a knuckle. “Do you \\nknow why this seat was quarried so flat and angular? So that no one would sit comfortably \\non it. I have not, and will relinquish it without regret when my time comes. \\nWhat is there to remind you of your obligations, Eragon? If the Empire falls, \\nwill you take Galbatorix’s place and claim his kingship?”\\n“I don’t seek to \\nwear the crown or rule,” said Eragon, troubled. “Being a Rider is \\nresponsibility enough. No, I would not take the throne in Urû’baen . . . not \\nunless there was no one else willing or competent enough to take it.”\\nHrothgar warned \\ngravely, “Certainly you would be a kinder king than Galbatorix, but no race \\nshould have a leader who does not age or leave the throne. The time of the \\nRiders has passed, Eragon. They will never rise again—not even if Galbatorix’s \\nother eggs were to hatch.”\\nA shadow crossed \\nhis face as he gazed at Eragon’s side. “I see that you carry an enemy’s sword; \\nI was told of this, and that you travel with a son of the Forsworn. It does not \\nplease me to see this weapon.” He extended a hand. “I would like to examine \\nit.”\\nEragon drew \\nZar’roc and presented it to the king, hilt first. Hrothgar grasped the sword \\nand ran a practiced eye over the red blade. The edge caught the lantern light, \\nreflecting it sharply. The dwarf king tested the point with his palm, then \\nsaid, “A masterfully forged blade. Elves rarely choose to make swords—they \\nprefer bows and spears—but when they do, the results are unmatched. This is an \\nill-fated blade; I am not glad to see it within my realm. But carry it if you \\nwill; perhaps its luck has changed.” He returned Zar’roc, and Eragon sheathed \\nit. “Has my nephew proved helpful during your time here?”\\n“Who?”\\nHrothgar raised \\na tangled eyebrow. “Orik, my youngest sister’s son. He’s been serving under \\nAjihad to show my support for the Varden. It seems that he has been returned to \\nmy command, however. I was gratified to hear that you defended him with your \\nwords.”\\nEragon \\nunderstood that this was another sign of otho, of “faith,” on Hrothgar’s part. \\n“I couldn’t ask for a better guide.”\\n“That is good,” \\nsaid the king, clearly pleased. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak with you much \\nlonger. My advisors wait for me, as there are matters I must deal with. I will \\nsay this, though: If you wish the support of the dwarves within my realm, you \\nmust first prove yourself to them. We have long memories and do not rush to \\nhasty decisions. Words will decide nothing, only deeds.”\\n“I will keep \\nthat in mind,” said Eragon, bowing again.\\nHrothgar nodded \\nregally. “You may go, then.”\\nEragon turned \\nwith Saphira, and they proceeded out of the hall of the mountain king. Orik was \\nwaiting for them on the other side of the stone doors, an anxious expression on \\nhis face. He fell in with them as they climbed back up to Tronjheim’s main \\nchamber. “Did all go well? Were you received favorably?”\\n“I think so. But \\nyour king is cautious,” said Eragon.\\n“That is how he \\nhas survived this long.”\\nI would not want \\nHrothgar angry at us,observed \\nSaphira.\\nEragon glanced \\nat her.No, I wouldn’t either. I’m not sure what he thought of you—he seems \\nto disapprove of dragons, though he didn’t say it outright.\\nThat seemed to \\namuse Saphira.In that he is wise, especially since he’s barely knee-high to \\nme.\\nIn Tronjheim’s \\ncenter, under the sparkling Isidar Mithrim, Orik said, “Your blessing yesterday \\nhas stirred up the Varden like an overturned beehive. The child Saphira touched \\nhas been hailed as a future hero. She and her guardian have been quartered in \\nthe finest rooms. Everyone is talking about your ‘miracle.’ All the human \\nmothers seem intent on finding you and getting the same for their children.”\\nAlarmed, Eragon \\nfurtively looked around. “What should we do?”\\n“Aside from \\ntaking back your actions?” asked Orik dryly. “Stay out of sight as much as \\npossible. Everyone will be kept out of the dragonhold, so you won’t be \\ndisturbed there.”\\nEragon did not \\nwant to return to the dragonhold yet. It was early in the day, and he wanted to \\nexplore Tronjheim with Saphira. Now that they were out of the Empire, there was \\nno reason for them to be apart. But he wanted to avoid attention, which would \\nbe impossible with her at his side.Saphira, what do you want to do?\\nShe nosed him, \\nscales brushing his arm.I’ll return to the dragonhold. There’s someone there \\nI want to meet. Wander around as long as you like.\\nAll right,he said,but \\nwho do you want to meet? Saphira only winked a large eye at him before \\npadding down one of Tronjheim’s four main tunnels.\\nEragon explained \\nto Orik where she was going, then said, “I’d like some breakfast. And then I’d \\nlike to see more of Tronjheim; it’s such an incredible place. I don’t want to \\ngo to the training grounds until tomorrow, as I’m still not fully recovered.”\\nOrik nodded, his \\nbeard bobbing on his chest. “In that case, would you like to visit Tronjheim’s \\nlibrary? It’s quite old and contains many scrolls of great value. You might \\nfind it interesting to read a history of Alagaësia that hasn’t been tainted by \\nGalbatorix’s hand.”\\nWith a pang, \\nEragon remembered how Brom had taught him to read. He wondered if he still had \\nthe skill. A long time had passed since he had seen any written words. “Yes, \\nlet’s do that.”\\n“Very well.”\\nAfter they ate, \\nOrik guided Eragon through myriad corridors to their destination. When they \\nreached the library’s carved arch, Eragon stepped through it reverently.\\nThe room \\nreminded him of a forest. Rows of graceful colonnades branched up to the dark, \\nribbed ceiling five stories above. Between the pillars, black-marble bookcases \\nstood back to back. Racks of scrolls covered the walls, interspersed with \\nnarrow walkways reached by three twisting staircases. Placed at regular \\nintervals around the walls were pairs of facing stone benches. Between them \\nwere small tables whose bases flowed seamlessly into the floor.\\nCountless books \\nand scrolls were stored in the room. “This is the true legacy of our race,” \\nsaid Orik. “Here reside the writings of our greatest kings and scholars, from \\nantiquity to the present. Also recorded are the songs and stories composed by \\nour artisans. This library may be our most precious possession. It isn’t all \\nour work, though—there are human writings here as well. Yours is a \\nshort-lived—but prolific—race. We have little or nothing of the elves’. They \\nguard their secrets jealously.”\\n“How long may I \\nstay?” asked Eragon, moving toward the shelves.\\n“As long as you \\nwant. Come to me if you have any questions.”\\nEragon browsed \\nthrough the volumes with delight, reaching eagerly for those with interesting \\ntitles or covers. Surprisingly, dwarves used the same runes to write as humans. \\nHe was somewhat disheartened by how hard reading was after months of neglect. \\nHe skipped from book to book, slowly working his way deep into the vast \\nlibrary. Eventually he became immersed in a translation of poems by Dóndar, the \\ntenth dwarf king.\\nAs he scanned \\nthe graceful lines, unfamiliar footsteps approached from behind the bookcase. \\nThe sound startled him, but he berated himself for being silly—he could not be \\nthe only person in the library. Even so, he quietly replaced the book and \\nslipped away, senses alert for danger. He had been ambushed too many times to \\nignore such feelings. He heard the footsteps again; only now there were two \\nsets of them. Apprehensive, he darted across an opening, trying to remember \\nexactly where Orik was sitting. He sidestepped around a corner and started as \\nhe found himself face to face with the Twins.\\nThe Twins stood \\ntogether, their shoulders meeting, a blank expression on their smooth faces. \\nTheir black snake eyes bored into him. Their hands, hidden within the folds of \\ntheir purple robes, twitched slightly. They both bowed, but the movement was \\ninsolent and derisive.\\n“We have been \\nsearching for you,” one said. His voice was uncomfortably like the Ra’zac’s.\\nEragon \\nsuppressed a shiver. “What for?” He reached out with his mind and contacted \\nSaphira. She immediately joined thoughts with him.\\n“Ever since you \\nmet with Ajihad, we have wanted to . . . apologize for our actions.” The words \\nwere mocking, but not in a way Eragon could challenge. “We have come to pay \\nhomage to you.” Eragon flushed angrily as they bowed again.\\nCareful!warned Saphira.\\nHe pushed back \\nhis rising temper. He could not afford to be riled by this confrontation. An \\nidea came to him, and he said with a small smile, “Nay, it is I who pay homage \\nto you. Without your approval I never could have gained entrance to Farthen \\nDûr.” He bowed to them in turn, making the movement as insulting as he could.\\nThere was a \\nflicker of irritation in the Twins’ eyes, but they smiled and said, “We are \\nhonored that one so . . . important . . . as yourself thinks so highly of us. \\nWe are in your debt for your kind words.”\\nNow it was \\nEragon’s turn to be irritated. “I will remember that when I’m in need.”\\nSaphira intruded \\nsharply in his thoughts.You’re overdoing it.Don’t say anything you’ll \\nregret. They will remember every word they can use against you.\\nThis is \\ndifficult enough without you making comments!he snapped. She subsided with an \\nexasperated grumble.\\nThe Twins moved \\ncloser, the hems of their robes brushing softly over the floor. Their voices \\nbecame more pleasant. “We have searched for you for another reason as well, \\nRider. The few magic users who live in Tronjheim have formed a group. We call \\nourselves Du Vrangr Gata, or the—”\\n“The Wandering \\nPath, I know,” interrupted Eragon, remembering what Angela had said about it.\\n“Your knowledge \\nof the ancient language is impressive,” said a Twin smoothly. “As we were \\nsaying, Du Vrangr Gata has heard of your mighty feats, and we have come to \\nextend an invitation of membership. We would be honored to have one of your \\nstature as a member. And I suspect that we might be able to assist you as \\nwell.”\\n“How?”\\nThe other Twin \\nsaid, “The two of us have garnered much experience in magical matters. We could \\nguide you . . . show you spells we’ve discovered and teach you words of power. \\nNothing would gladden us more than if we could assist, in some small way, your \\npath to glory. No repayment would be necessary, though if you saw fit to share \\nsome scraps of your own knowledge, we would be satisfied.”\\nEragon’s face \\nhardened as he realized what they were asking for. “Do you think I’m a half-wit?” \\nhe demanded harshly. “I won’t apprentice myself to you so you can learn the \\nwords Brom taught me! It must have angered you when you couldn’t steal them \\nfrom my mind.”\\nThe Twins \\nabruptly dropped their facade of smiles. “We are not to be trifled with, boy! \\nWe are the ones who will test your abilities with magic. And that could bemost \\nunpleasant. Remember, it only takes one misconceived spell to kill someone. You \\nmay be a Rider, but the two of us are still stronger than you.”\\nEragon kept his \\nface expressionless, even as his stomach knotted painfully. “I will consider \\nyour offer, but it may—”\\n“Then we will \\nexpect your answer tomorrow. Make sure that it is the right one.” They smiled \\ncoldly and stalked deeper into the library.\\nEragon scowled.I’m \\nnot going to join Du Vrangr Gata, no matter what they do.\\nYou should talk \\nto Angela,said \\nSaphira.She’s dealt with the Twins before. Perhaps she could be there when \\nthey test you. That might prevent them from harming you.\\nThat’s a good \\nidea.Eragon \\nwound through the bookcases until he found Orik sitting on a bench, busily \\npolishing his war ax. “I’d like to return to the dragonhold.”\\nThe dwarf slid \\nthe haft of the ax through a leather loop at his belt, then escorted Eragon to \\nthe gate where Saphira waited. People had already gathered around her. Ignoring \\nthem, Eragon scrambled onto Saphira’s back, and they escaped to the sky.\\nThis problem \\nmust be resolved quickly. You cannot let the Twins intimidate you,Saphira said as \\nshe landed on Isidar Mithrim.\\nI know. But I \\nhope we can avoid angering them.They could be dangerous enemies.He dismounted \\nquickly, keeping a hand on Zar’roc.\\nSo can you. Do \\nyou want them as allies? \\nHe shook his \\nhead.Not really . . . I’ll tell them tomorrow that I won’t join Du Vrangr \\nGata.\\nEragon left \\nSaphira in her cave and wandered out of the dragonhold. He wanted to see \\nAngela, but he didn’t remember how to find her hiding place, and Solembum was \\nnot there to guide him. He roamed the deserted corridors, hoping to meet Angela \\nby chance.\\nWhen he grew \\ntired of staring at empty rooms and endless gray walls, he retraced his \\nfootsteps to the hold. As he neared it, he heard someone speaking within the \\nroom. He halted and listened, but the clear voice fell silent.Saphira?Who’s \\nin there?\\nA female . . . \\nShe has an air of command. I’ll distract her while you come in.Eragon loosened \\nZar’roc in its sheath.Orik said that intruders would be kept out of the \\ndragonhold, so who could this be? He steadied his nerves, then stepped into \\nthe hold, his hand on the sword.\\nA young woman \\nstood in the center of the room, looking curiously at Saphira, who had stuck \\nher head out of the cave. The woman appeared to be about seventeen years old. \\nThe star sapphire cast a rosy light on her, accentuating skin the same deep \\nshade as Ajihad’s. Her velvet dress was wine red and elegantly cut. A jeweled \\ndagger, worn with use, hung from her waist in a tooled leather sheath.\\nEragon crossed \\nhis arms, waiting for the woman to notice him. She continued to look at \\nSaphira, then curtsied and asked sweetly, “Please, could you tell me where \\nRider Eragon is?” Saphira’s eyes sparkled with amusement.\\nWith a small \\nsmile, Eragon said, “I am here.”\\nThe woman \\nwhirled to face him, hand flying to her dagger. Her face was striking, with \\nalmond-shaped eyes, wide lips, and round cheekbones. She relaxed and curtsied \\nagain. “I am Nasuada,” she said.\\nEragon inclined \\nhis head. “You obviously know who I am, but what do you want?”\\nNasuada smiled \\ncharmingly. “My father, Ajihad, sent me here with a message. Would you like to \\nhear it?”\\nThe Varden’s \\nleader had not struck Eragon as one inclined to marriage and fatherhood. He \\nwondered who Nasuada’s mother was—she must have been an uncommon woman to have \\nattracted Ajihad’s eye. “Yes, I would.”\\nNasuada tossed \\nher hair back and recited: “He is pleased that you are doing well, but he \\ncautions you against actions like your benediction yesterday. They create more \\nproblems than they solve. Also, he urges you to proceed with the testing as \\nsoon as possible—he needs to know how capable you are before he communicates \\nwith the elves.”\\n“Did you climb \\nall the way up here just to tell me that?” Eragon asked, thinking of Vol \\nTurin’s length.\\nNasuada shook \\nher head. “I used the pulley system that transports goods to the upper levels. \\nWe could have sent the message with signals, but I decided to bring it myself \\nand meet you in person.”\\n“Would you like \\nto sit down?” asked Eragon. He motioned toward Saphira’s cave.\\nNasuada laughed \\nlightly. “No, I am expected elsewhere. You should also know, my father decreed \\nthat you may visit Murtagh, if you wish.” A somber expression disturbed her \\npreviously smooth features. “I met Murtagh earlier. . . . He’s anxious to speak \\nwith you. He seemed lonely; you should visit him.” She gave Eragon directions \\nto Murtagh’s cell.\\nEragon thanked \\nher for the news, then asked, “What about Arya? Is she better? Can I see her? \\nOrik wasn’t able to tell me much.”\\nShe smiled \\nmischievously. “Arya is recovering swiftly, as all elves do. No one is allowed \\nto see her except my father, Hrothgar, and the healers. They have spent much \\ntime with her, learning all that occurred during her imprisonment.” She swept \\nher eyes over Saphira. “I must go now. Is there anything you would have me \\nconvey to Ajihad on your behalf?”\\n“No, except a \\ndesire to visit Arya. And give him my thanks for the hospitality he’s shown \\nus.”\\n“I will take \\nyour words directly to him. Farewell, Rider Eragon. I hope we shall soon meet \\nagain.” She curtsied and exited the dragonhold, head held high.\\nIf she really came \\nall the way up Tronjheim just to meet me—pulleys or no pulleys—there was more \\nto this meeting than idle chatter,remarked Eragon.\\nAye,said Saphira, \\nwithdrawing her head into the cave. Eragon climbed up to her and was surprised \\nto see Solembum curled up in the hollow at the base of her neck. The werecat \\nwas purring deeply, his black-tipped tail flicking back and forth. The two of \\nthem looked at Eragon impudently, as if to ask, “What?”\\nEragon shook his \\nhead, laughing helplessly.Saphira, is Solembum who you wanted to meet?\\nThey both \\nblinked at him and answered,Yes.\\nJust wondering,he said, mirth \\nstill bubbling inside him. It made sense that they would befriend each \\nother—their personalities were similar, and they were both creatures of magic. \\nHe sighed, releasing some of the day’s tension as he unbuckled Zar’roc.Solembum, \\ndo you know where Angela is? I couldn’t find her, and I need her advice.\\nSolembum kneaded \\nhis paws against Saphira’s scaled back.She is somewhere in Tronjheim.\\nWhen will she \\nreturn?\\n\\nSoon. \\nHow soon?he asked \\nimpatiently.I need to talk to her today.\\nNot that soon. \\nThe werecat \\nrefused to say more, despite Eragon’s persistent questions. He gave up and \\nnestled against Saphira. Solembum’s purring was a low thrum above his head.I \\nhave to visit Murtagh tomorrow, he thought, fingering Brom’s ring.\\nA RYA’STEST\\nOn the morning of \\ntheir third day in Tronjheim, Eragon rolled out of bed refreshed and energized. \\nHe belted Zar’roc to his waist and slung his bow and half-full quiver across \\nhis back. After a leisurely flight inside Farthen Dûr with Saphira, he met Orik \\nby one of Tronjheim’s four main gates. Eragon asked him about Nasuada.\\n“An unusual \\ngirl,” answered Orik, glancing disapprovingly at Zar’roc. “She’s totally \\ndevoted to her father and spends all her time helping him. I think she does \\nmore for Ajihad than he knows—there have been times when she’s maneuvered his \\nenemies without ever revealing her part in it.”\\n“Who is her \\nmother?”\\n“That I don’t \\nknow. Ajihad was alone when he brought Nasuada to Farthen Dûr as a newborn \\nchild. He’s never said where he and Nasuada came from.”\\nSo she too grew \\nup without knowing her mother.He shook off the thought. “I’m restless. \\nIt’ll be good to use my muscles. Where should I go for this ‘testing’ of \\nAjihad’s?”\\nOrik pointed out \\ninto Farthen Dûr. “The training field is half a mile from Tronjheim, though you \\ncan’t see it from here because it’s behind the city-mountain. It’s a large area \\nwhere both dwarves and humans practice.”\\nI’m coming as \\nwell,stated \\nSaphira.\\nEragon told \\nOrik, and the dwarf tugged on his beard. “That might not be a good idea. There \\nare many people at the training field; you will be sure to attract attention.”\\nSaphira growled \\nloudly.I will come! And that settled the matter.\\n\\xa0\\nThe unruly \\nclatter of fighting reached them from the field: the loud clang of steel \\nclashing on steel, the solid thump of arrows striking padded targets, the \\nrattle and crack of wooden staves, and the shouts of men in mock battle. The \\nnoise was confusing, yet each group had a unique rhythm and pattern.\\nThe bulk of the \\ntraining ground was occupied by a crooked block of foot soldiers struggling \\nwith shields and poleaxes nearly as tall as themselves. They drilled as a group \\nin formations. Practicing beside them were hundreds of individual warriors \\noutfitted with swords, maces, spears, staves, flails, shields of all shapes and \\nsizes, and even, Eragon saw, someone with a pitchfork. Nearly all the fighters \\nwore armor, usually chain mail and a helmet; plate armor was not as common. \\nThere were as many dwarves as humans, though the two kept mainly to themselves. \\nBehind the sparring warriors, a broad line of archers fired steadily at gray \\nsackcloth dummies.\\nBefore Eragon \\nhad time to wonder what he was supposed to do, a bearded man, his head and \\nblocky shoulders covered by a mail coif, strode over to them. The rest of him \\nwas protected by a rough oxhide suit that still had hair on it. A huge \\nsword—almost as long as Eragon—hung across his broad back. He ran a quick eye \\nover Saphira and Eragon, as if evaluating how dangerous they were, then said \\ngruffly, “Knurla Orik. You’ve been gone too long. There’s nobody left for me to \\nspar with.”\\nOrik smiled. \\n“Oeí, that’s because you bruise everyone from head to toe with your monster \\nsword.”\\n“Everyone except \\nyou,” he corrected.\\n“That’s because \\nI’m faster than a giant like you.”\\nThe man looked \\nat Eragon again. “I’m Fredric. I’ve been told to find out what you can do. How \\nstrong are you?”\\n“Strong enough,” \\nanswered Eragon. “I have to be in order to fight with magic.”\\nFredric shook \\nhis head; the coif clinked like a bag of coins. “Magic has no place in what we \\ndo here. Unless you’ve served in an army, I doubt any fights you’ve been in \\nlasted more than a few minutes. What we’re concerned about is how you’ll be \\nable to hold up in a battle that may drag on for hours, or even weeks if it’s a \\nsiege. Do you know how to use any weapons besides that sword and bow?”\\nEragon thought \\nabout it. “Only my fists.”\\n“Good answer!” \\nlaughed Fredric. “Well, we’ll start you off with the bow and see how you do. \\nThen once some space has cleared up on the field, we’ll try—” He broke off \\nsuddenly and stared past Eragon, scowling angrily.\\nThe Twins \\nstalked toward them, their bald heads pale against their purple robes. Orik \\nmuttered something in his own language as he slipped his war ax out of his \\nbelt. “I told you two to stay away from the training area,” said Fredric, \\nstepping forward threateningly. The Twins seemed frail before his bulk.\\nThey looked at \\nhim arrogantly. “We were ordered by Ajihad to test Eragon’s proficiency with \\nmagic—beforeyou exhaust him banging on pieces of metal.”\\nFredric \\nglowered. “Why can’t someone else test him?”\\n“No one else is \\npowerful enough,” sniffed the Twins. Saphira rumbled deeply and glared at them. \\nA line of smoke trickled from her nostrils, but they ignored her. “Come with \\nus,” they ordered, and strode to an empty corner of the field.\\nShrugging, \\nEragon followed with Saphira. Behind him he heard Fredric say to Orik, “We have \\nto stop them from going too far.”\\n“I know,” \\nanswered Orik in a low voice, “but I can’t interfere again. Hrothgar made it \\nclear he won’t be able to protect me the next time it happens.”\\nEragon forced \\nback his growing apprehension. The Twins might know more techniques and words. \\n. . . Still, he remembered what Brom had told him: Riders were stronger in \\nmagic than ordinary men. But would that be enough to resist the combined power \\nof the Twins?\\nDon’t worry so \\nmuch; I will help you,said Saphira.There are two of us as well.\\nHe touched her \\ngently on the leg, relieved by her words. The Twins looked at Eragon and asked, \\n“And how do you answer us, Eragon?”\\nOverlooking the \\npuzzled expressions of his companions, he said flatly, “No.”\\nSharp lines \\nappeared at the corners of the Twins’ mouths. They turned so they faced Eragon \\nobliquely and, bending at the waists, drew a large pentagram on the ground. \\nThey stepped in the middle of it, then said harshly, “We begin now. You will \\nattempt to complete the tasks we assign you . . . that is all.”\\nOne of the Twins \\nreached into his robe, produced a polished rock the size of Eragon’s fist, and \\nset it on the ground. “Lift it to eye level.”\\nThat’s easy \\nenough,commented \\nEragon to Saphira. “Stenr reisa!” The rock wobbled, then smoothly rose from the \\nground. Before it went more than a foot, an unexpected resistance halted it in \\nmidair. A smile touched the Twins’ lips. Eragon stared at them, enraged—they \\nwere trying to make him fail! If he became exhausted now, it would be \\nimpossible to complete the harder tasks. Obviously they were confident that \\ntheir combined strength could easily wear him down.\\nBut I’m not \\nalone either,snarled \\nEragon to himself.Saphira, now! Her mind melded with his, and the rock \\njerked through the air to stop, quivering, at eye level. The Twins’ eyes \\nnarrowed cruelly.\\n“Very . . . \\ngood,” they hissed. Fredric looked unnerved by the display of magic. “Now move \\nthe stone in a circle.” Again Eragon struggled against their efforts to stop \\nhim, and again—to their obvious anger—he prevailed. The exercises quickly \\nincreased in complexity and difficulty until Eragon was forced to think \\ncarefully about which words to use. And each time, the Twins fought him \\nbitterly, though the strain never showed on their faces.\\nIt was only with \\nSaphira’s support that Eragon was able to hold his ground. In a break between \\ntwo of the tasks, he asked her,Why do they continue this testing? Our \\nabilities were clear enough from what they saw in my mind. She cocked her \\nhead thoughtfully.You know what? he said grimly as comprehension came to \\nhim.They’re using this as an opportunity to figure out what ancient words I \\nknow and perhaps learn new ones themselves.\\nSpeak softly \\nthen, so that they cannot hear you, and use the simplest words possible. \\nFrom then on, \\nEragon used only a handful of basic words to complete the tasks. But finding \\nways to make them perform in the same manner as a long sentence or phrase stretched \\nhis ingenuity to the limit. He was rewarded by the frustration that contorted \\nthe Twins’ faces as he foiled them again and again. No matter what they tried, \\nthey could not get him to use any more words in the ancient language.\\nMore than an \\nhour passed, but the Twins showed no sign of stopping. Eragon was hot and \\nthirsty, but refrained from asking for a reprieve—he would continue as long as \\nthey did. There were many tests: manipulating water, casting fire, scrying, \\njuggling rocks, hardening leather, freezing items, controlling the flight of an \\narrow, and healing scratches. He wondered how long it would take for the Twins \\nto run out of ideas.\\nFinally the \\nTwins raised their hands and said, “There is only one thing left to do. It is \\nsimple enough—anycompetent user of magic should find this easy.” One of \\nthem removed a silver ring from his finger and smugly handed it to Eragon. \\n“Summon the essence of silver.”\\nEragon stared at \\nthe ring in confusion. What was he supposed to do? The essence of silver, what \\nwas that? And how was it to be summoned? Saphira had no idea, and the Twins \\nwere not going to help. He had never learned silver’s name in the ancient \\nlanguage, though he knew it had to be part ofargetlam. In desperation he \\ncombined the only word that might work,ethgrí, or “invoke,” witharget.\\nDrawing himself \\nupright, he gathered together what power he had left and parted his lips to \\ndeliver the invocation. Suddenly a clear, vibrant voice split the air.\\n“Stop!”\\nThe word rushed \\nover Eragon like cool water—the voice was strangely familiar, like a \\nhalf-remembered melody. The back of his neck tingled. He slowly turned toward \\nits source.\\nA lone figure \\nstood behind them: Arya. A leather strip encircled her brow, restraining her \\nvoluminous black hair, which tumbled behind her shoulders in a lustrous \\ncascade. Her slender sword was at her hip, her bow on her back. Plain black \\nleather clothed her shapely frame, poor raiment for one so fair. She was taller \\nthan most men, and her stance was perfectly balanced and relaxed. An unmarked \\nface reflected none of the horrific abuse she had endured.\\nArya’s blazing \\nemerald eyes were fixed on the Twins, who had turned pale with fright. She \\napproached on silent footsteps and said in soft, menacing tones, “Shame! Shame \\nto ask of him what only a master can do. Shame that you should use such \\nmethods. Shame that you told Ajihad you didn’t know Eragon’s abilities. He is \\ncompetent. Now leave!” Arya frowned dangerously, her slanted eyebrows meeting \\nlike lightning bolts in a sharp V, and pointed at the ring in Eragon’s hand. \\n“Arget!” she exclaimed thunderously.\\nThe silver \\nshimmered, and a ghostly image of the ring materialized next to it. The two \\nwere identical except that the apparition seemed purer and glowed white-hot. At \\nthe sight of it, the Twins spun on their heels and fled, robes flapping wildly. \\nThe insubstantial ring vanished from Eragon’s hand, leaving the circlet of \\nsilver behind. Orik and Fredric were on their feet, eyeing Arya warily. Saphira \\ncrouched, ready for action.\\nThe elf surveyed \\nthem all. Her angled eyes paused on Eragon. Then she turned and strode toward \\nthe heart of the training field. The warriors ceased their sparring and looked \\nat her with wonder. Within a few moments the entire field fell silent in awe of \\nher presence.\\nEragon was \\ninexorably dragged forward by his own fascination. Saphira spoke, but he was \\noblivious to her comments. A large circle formed around Arya. Looking only at \\nEragon, she proclaimed, “I claim the right of trial by arms. Draw your sword.”\\nShe means to \\nduel me!\\n\\nBut not, I \\nthink, to harm you,replied \\nSaphira slowly. She nudged him with her nose.Go and acquit yourself well. I \\nwill watch.\\nEragon \\nreluctantly stepped forward. He did not want to do this when he was exhausted \\nfrom magic use and when there were so many people watching. Besides, Arya could \\nbe in no shape for sparring. It had only been two days since she had received \\nTúnivor’s Nectar.I will soften my blows so I don’t hurt her, he decided.\\nThey faced each \\nother across the circle of warriors. Arya drew her sword with her left hand. \\nThe weapon was thinner than Eragon’s, but just as long and sharp. He slid \\nZar’roc out of its polished sheath and held the red blade point-down by his \\nside. For a long moment they stood motionless, elf and human watching each \\nother. It flashed through Eragon’s mind that this was how many of his fights \\nwith Brom had started.\\nHe moved forward \\ncautiously. With a blur of motion Arya jumped at him, slashing at his ribs. \\nEragon reflexively parried the attack, and their swords met in a shower of \\nsparks. Zar’roc was batted aside as if it were no more than a fly. The elf did \\nnot take advantage of the opening, however, but spun to her right, hair \\nwhipping through the air, and struck at his other side. He barely stopped the blow \\nand backpedaled frantically, stunned by her ferocity and speed.\\nBelatedly, \\nEragon remembered Brom’s warning that even the weakest elf could easily \\noverpower a human. He had about as much chance of defeating Arya as he did \\nDurza. She attacked again, swinging at his head. He ducked under the \\nrazor-sharp edge. But then why was she . . .toying with him? For a few \\nlong seconds he was too busy warding her off to think about it, then he \\nrealized,She wants to know how proficient I am.\\nUnderstanding \\nthat, he began the most complicated series of attacks he knew. He flowed from \\none pose to another, recklessly combining and modifying them in every possible \\nway. But no matter how inventive he was, Arya’s sword always stopped his. She \\nmatched his actions with effortless grace.\\nEngaged in a \\nfiery dance, their bodies were linked and separated by the flashing blades. At \\ntimes they nearly touched, taut skin only a hair’s breadth away, but then \\nmomentum would whirl them apart, and they would withdraw for a second, only to \\njoin again. Their sinuous forms wove together like twisting ropes of windblown \\nsmoke.\\nEragon could \\nnever remember how long they fought. It was timeless, filled with nothing but \\naction and reaction. Zar’roc grew leaden in his hand; his arm burned \\nferociously with each stroke. At last, as he lunged forward, Arya nimbly \\nsidestepped, sweeping the point of her sword up to his jawbone with \\nsupernatural speed.\\nEragon froze as \\nthe icy metal touched his skin. His muscles trembled from the exertion. Dimly \\nhe heard Saphira bugle and the warriors cheering raucously around them. Arya \\nlowered her sword and sheathed it. “You have passed,” she said quietly amid the \\nnoise.\\nDazed, he slowly \\nstraightened. Fredric was beside him now, thumping his back enthusiastically. \\n“That was incredible swordsmanship! I even learned some new moves from watching \\nthe two of you. And the elf—stunning!”\\nBut I lost,he protested \\nsilently. Orik praised his performance with a broad smile, but all Eragon \\nnoticed was Arya, standing alone and silent. She motioned slightly with a \\nfinger, no more than a twitch, toward a knoll about a mile from the practice \\nfield, then turned and walked away. The crowd melted before her. A hush fell \\nover the men and dwarves as she passed.\\nEragon turned to \\nOrik. “I have to go. I’ll return to the dragonhold soon.” With a swift jab, \\nEragon sheathed Zar’roc and pulled himself onto Saphira. She took off over the \\ntraining field, which turned into a sea of faces as everyone looked at her.\\nAs they soared \\ntoward the knoll, Eragon saw Arya running below them with clean, easy strides. \\nSaphira commented,You find her form pleasing, do you not?\\nYes,he admitted, \\nblushing.\\nHer face does \\nhave more character than that of most humans,she sniffed.But it’s long, \\nlike a horse’s, and overall she’s rather shapeless.\\nEragon looked at \\nSaphira with amazement.You’re jealous, aren’t you!\\nImpossible. I \\nnever get jealous,she \\nsaid, offended.\\nYou are now, \\nadmit it!he \\nlaughed.\\nShe snapped her \\njaws together loudly.I am not! He smiled and shook his head, but let her \\ndenial stand. She landed heavily on the knoll, jostling him roughly. He jumped \\ndown without remarking on it.\\nArya was close \\nbehind them. Her fleet stride carried her faster than any runner Eragon had \\nseen. When she reached the top of the knoll, her breathing was smooth and \\nregular. Suddenly tongue-tied, Eragon dropped his gaze. She strode past him and \\nsaid to Saphira, “Skulblaka, eka celöbra ono un mulabra ono un onr Shur’tugal \\nné haina. Atra nosu waíse fricai.”\\nEragon did not \\nrecognize most of the words, but Saphira obviously understood the message. She \\nshuffled her wings and surveyed Arya curiously. Then she nodded, humming \\ndeeply. Arya smiled. “I am glad that you recovered,” Eragon said. “We didn’t \\nknow if you would live or not.”\\n“That is why I \\ncame here today,” said Arya, facing him. Her rich voice was accented and \\nexotic. She spoke clearly, with a hint of trill, as if she were about to sing. \\n“I owe you a debt that must be repaid. You saved my life. That can never be \\nforgotten.”\\n“It—it was \\nnothing,” said Eragon, fumbling with the words and knowing they were not true, \\neven as he spoke them. Embarrassed, he changed the subject. “How did you come \\nto be in Gil’ead?”\\nPain shadowed \\nArya’s face. She looked away into the distance. “Let us walk.” They descended from \\nthe knoll and meandered toward Farthen Dûr. Eragon respected Arya’s silence as \\nthey walked. Saphira padded quietly beside them. Finally Arya lifted her head \\nand said with the grace of her kind, “Ajihad told me you were present when \\nSaphira’s egg appeared.”\\n“Yes.” For the \\nfirst time, Eragon thought about the energy it must have taken to transport the \\negg over the dozens of leagues that separated Du Weldenvarden from the Spine. \\nTo even attempt such a feat was courting disaster, if not death.\\nHer next words \\nwere heavy. “Then know this: at the moment you first beheld it, I was captured \\nby Durza.” Her voice filled with bitterness and grief. “It was he who led the \\nUrgals that ambushed and slew my companions, Faolin and Glenwing. Somehow he \\nknew where to wait for us—we had no warning. I was drugged and transported to \\nGil’ead. There, Durza was charged by Galbatorix to learn where I had sent the \\negg and all I knew of Ellesméra.”\\nShe stared ahead \\nicily, jaw clenched. “He tried for months without success. His methods were . . \\n. harsh. When torture failed, he ordered his soldiers to use me as they would. \\nFortunately, I still had the strength to nudge their minds and make them \\nincapable. At last Galbatorix ordered that I was to be brought to Urû’baen. \\nDread filled me when I learned this, as I was weary in both mind and body and \\nhad no strength to resist him. If it were not for you, I would have stood \\nbefore Galbatorix in a week’s time.”\\nEragon shuddered \\ninwardly. It was amazing what she had survived. The memory of her injuries was \\nstill vivid in his mind. Softly, he asked, “Why do you tell me all this?”\\n“So that you \\nknow what I was saved from. Do not presume I can ignore your deed.”\\nHumbled, he \\nbowed his head. “What will you do now—return to Ellesméra?”\\n“No, not yet. \\nThere is much that must be done here. I cannot abandon the Varden—Ajihad needs \\nmy help. I’ve seen you tested in both arms and magic today. Brom taught you \\nwell. You are ready to proceed in your training.”\\n“You mean for me \\nto go to Ellesméra?”\\n“Yes.”\\nEragon felt a \\nflash of irritation. Did he and Saphira have no say in the matter? “When?”\\n“That is yet to \\nbe decided, but not for some weeks.”\\nAt least they \\ngave us that much time,thought Eragon. Saphira mentioned something to him, \\nand he in turn asked Arya, “What did the Twins want me to do?”\\nArya’s sculpted \\nlip curled with disgust. “Something not even they can accomplish. It is \\npossible to speak the name of an object in the ancient language and summon its \\ntrue form. It takes years of work and great discipline, but the reward is \\ncomplete control over the object. That is why one’s true name is always kept \\nhidden, for if it were known by any with evil in their hearts, they could \\ndominate you utterly.”\\n“It’s strange,” \\nsaid Eragon after a moment, “but before I was captured at Gil’ead, I had \\nvisions of you in my dreams. It was like scrying—and I was able to scry you \\nlater—but it was always during my sleep.”\\nArya pursed her \\nlips pensively. “There were times I felt as if another presence was watching \\nme, but I was often confused and feverish. I’ve never heard of anyone, either \\nin lore or legend, being able to scry in their sleep.”\\n“I don’t \\nunderstand it myself,” said Eragon, looking at his hands. He twirled Brom’s \\nring around his finger. “What does the tattoo on your shoulder mean? I didn’t \\nmean to see it, but when I was healing your wounds . . . it couldn’t be helped. \\nIt’s just like the symbol on this ring.”\\n“You have a ring \\nwith the yawë on it?” she asked sharply.\\n“Yes. It was \\nBrom’s. See?”\\nHe held out the \\nring. Arya examined the sapphire, then said, “This is a token given only to the \\nmost valued elf-friends—so valued, in fact, it has not been used in centuries. \\nOr so I thought. I never knew that Queen Islanzadi thought so highly of Brom.”\\n“I shouldn’t \\nwear it, then,” said Eragon, afraid that he had been presumptuous.\\n“No, keep it. It \\nwill give you protection if you meet my people by chance, and it may help you \\ngain favor with the queen. Tell no one of my tattoo. It should not be \\nrevealed.”\\n“Very well.”\\n\\xa0\\nHe enjoyed \\ntalking with Arya and wished their conversation could have lasted longer. When \\nthey parted, he wandered through Farthen Dûr, conversing with Saphira. Despite \\nhis prodding, she refused to tell him what Arya had said to her. Eventually his \\nthoughts turned to Murtagh and then to Nasuada’s advice.I’ll get something \\nto eat, then go see him, he decided.Will you wait for me so I can return \\nto the dragonhold with you?\\nI will wait—go,said Saphira.\\nWith a grateful \\nsmile, Eragon dashed to Tronjheim, ate in an obscure corner of a kitchen, then \\nfollowed Nasuada’s instructions until he reached a small gray door guarded by a \\nman and a dwarf. When he requested entrance, the dwarf banged on the door three \\ntimes, then unbolted it. “Just holler when you want to leave,” said the man \\nwith a friendly smile.\\nThe cell was \\nwarm and well lit, with a washbasin in one corner and a writing desk—equipped \\nwith quills and ink—in another. The ceiling was extensively carved with \\nlacquered figures; the floor was covered with a plush rug. Murtagh lay on a \\nstout bed, reading a scroll. He looked up in surprise and exclaimed cheerily, \\n“Eragon! I’d hoped you would come!”\\n“How did . . . I \\nmean I thought—”\\n“You thought I \\nwas stuck in some rat hole chewing on hardtack,” said Murtagh, rolling upright \\nwith a grin. “Actually, I expected the same thing, but Ajihad lets me have all \\nthis as long as I don’t cause trouble. And they bring me huge meals, as well as \\nanything I want from the library. If I’m not careful, I’ll turn into a fat \\nscholar.”\\nEragon laughed, \\nand with a wondering smile seated himself next to Murtagh. “But aren’t you \\nangry? You’re still a prisoner.”\\n“Oh, I was at \\nfirst,” said Murtagh with a shrug. “But the more I thought about it, the more I \\ncame to realize that this is really the best place for me. Even if Ajihad gave \\nme my freedom, I would stay in my room most of the time anyway.”\\n“But why?”\\n“You know well \\nenough. No one would be at ease around me, knowing my true identity, and there \\nwould always be people who wouldn’t limit themselves to harsh looks or words. \\nBut enough of that, I’m eager to know what’s new. Come, tell me.”\\nEragon recounted \\nthe events of the past two days, including his encounter with the Twins in the \\nlibrary. When he finished, Murtagh leaned back reflectively. “I suspect,” he \\nsaid, “that Arya is more important than either of us thought. Consider what \\nyou’ve learned: she is a master of the sword, powerful in magic, and, most \\nsignificantly, was chosen to guard Saphira’s egg. She cannot be ordinary, even \\namong the elves.”\\nEragon agreed.\\nMurtagh stared \\nat the ceiling. “You know, I find this imprisonment oddly peaceful. For once in \\nmy life I don’t have to be afraid. I know I ought to be . . . yet something \\nabout this place puts me at ease. A good night’s sleep helps, too.”\\n“I know what you \\nmean,” said Eragon wryly. He moved to a softer place on the bed. “Nasuada said \\nthat she visited you. Did she say anything interesting?”\\nMurtagh’s gaze \\nshifted into the distance, and he shook his head. “No, she only wanted to meet \\nme. Doesn’t she look like a princess? And the way she carries herself! When she \\nfirst entered through that doorway, I thought she was one of the great ladies \\nof Galbatorix’s court. I’ve seen earls and counts who had wives that, compared \\nto her, were more fitted for life as a hog than of nobility.”\\nEragon listened \\nto his praise with growing apprehension.It may mean nothing, he reminded \\nhimself.You’re leaping to conclusions. Yet the foreboding would not \\nleave him. Trying to shake off the feeling, he asked, “How long are you going \\nto remain imprisoned, Murtagh? You can’t hide forever.”\\nMurtagh shrugged \\ncarelessly, but there was weight behind his words. “For now I’m content to stay \\nand rest. There’s no reason for me to seek shelter elsewhere nor submit myself \\nto the Twins’ examination. No doubt I’ll tire of this eventually, but for now . \\n. . I am content.”\\nT HESHADOWS \\nLENGTHEN\\nSaphira woke \\nEragon with a sharp rap of her snout, bruising him with her hard jaw. “Ouch!” \\nhe exclaimed, sitting upright. The cave was dark except for a faint glow \\nemanating from the shuttered lantern. Outside in the dragonhold, Isidar Mithrim \\nglittered with a thousand different colors, illuminated by its girdle of \\nlanterns.\\nAn agitated \\ndwarf stood in the entrance to the cave, wringing his hands. “You must come, \\nArgetlam! Great trouble—Ajihad summons you. There is no time!”\\n“What’s wrong?” \\nasked Eragon.\\nThe dwarf only \\nshook his head, beard wagging. “Go, you must! Carkna bragha! Now!”\\nEragon belted on \\nZar’roc, grabbed his bow and arrows, then strapped the saddle onto Saphira.So \\nmuch for a good night’s sleep, she groused, crouching low to the floor so \\nhe could clamber onto her back. He yawned loudly as Saphira launched herself \\nfrom the cave.\\nOrik was waiting \\nfor them with a grim expression when they landed at Tronjheim’s gates. “Come, \\nthe others are waiting.” He led them through Tronjheim to Ajihad’s study. On \\nthe way, Eragon plied him with questions, but Orik would only say, “I don’t know \\nenough myself—wait until you hear Ajihad.”\\nThe large study \\ndoor was opened by a pair of burly guards. Ajihad stood behind his desk, \\nbleakly inspecting a map. Arya and a man with wiry arms were there as well. \\nAjihad looked up. “Good, you’re here, Eragon. Meet Jörmundur, my second in \\ncommand.”\\nThey \\nacknowledged each other, then turned their attention to Ajihad. “I roused the \\nfive of you because we are all in grave danger. About half an hour ago a dwarf \\nran out of an abandoned tunnel under Tronjheim. He was bleeding and nearly \\nincoherent, but he had enough sense left to tell the dwarves what was pursuing \\nhim: an army of Urgals, maybe a day’s march from here.”\\nShocked silence \\nfilled the study. Then Jörmundur swore explosively and began asking questions \\nat the same time Orik did. Arya remained silent. Ajihad raised his hands. \\n“Quiet! There is more. The Urgals aren’t approachingover land, butunder \\nit. They’re in the tunnels . . . we’re going to be attacked from below.”\\nEragon raised \\nhis voice in the din that followed. “Why didn’t the dwarves know about this \\nsooner? How did the Urgals find the tunnels?”\\n“We’re lucky to \\nknow about it this early!” bellowed Orik. Everyone stopped talking to hear him. \\n“There are hundreds of tunnels throughout the Beor Mountains, uninhabited since \\nthe day they were mined. The only dwarves who go in them are eccentrics who \\ndon’t want contact with anyone. We could have just as easily received no \\nwarning at all.”\\nAjihad pointed \\nat the map, and Eragon moved closer. The map depicted the southern half of \\nAlagaësia, but unlike Eragon’s, it showed the entire Beor Mountain range in \\ndetail. Ajihad’s finger was on the section of the Beor Mountains that touched \\nSurda’s eastern border. “This,” he said, “is where the dwarf claimed to have \\ncome from.”\\n“Orthíad!” \\nexclaimed Orik. At Jörmundur’s puzzled inquiry, he explained, “It’s an ancient \\ndwelling of ours that was deserted when Tronjheim was completed. During its \\ntime it was the greatest of our cities. But no one’s lived there for \\ncenturies.”\\n“And it’s old \\nenough for some of the tunnels to have collapsed,” said Ajihad. “That’s how we \\nsurmise it was discovered from the surface. I suspect that Orthíad is now being \\ncalled Ithrö Zhâda. That’s where the Urgal column that was chasing Eragon and \\nSaphira was supposed to go, and I’m sure it’s where the Urgals have been \\nmigrating all year. From Ithrö Zhâda they can travel anywhere they want in the \\nBeor Mountains. They have the power to destroy both the Varden and the \\ndwarves.”\\nJörmundur bent \\nover the map, eyeing it carefully. “Do you know how many Urgals there are? Are \\nGalbatorix’s troops with them? We can’t plan a defense without knowing how \\nlarge their army is.”\\nAjihad replied \\nunhappily, “We’re unsure about both those things, yet our survival rests on \\nthat last question. If Galbatorix has augmented the Urgals’ ranks with his own \\nmen, we don’t stand a chance. But if he hasn’t—because he still doesn’t want \\nhis alliance with the Urgals revealed, or for some other reason—it’s possible \\nwe can win. Neither Orrin nor the elves can help us at this late hour. Even so, \\nI sent runners to both of them with news of our plight. At the very least they \\nwon’t be caught by surprise if we fall.”\\nHe drew a hand \\nacross his coal-black brow. “I’ve already talked with Hrothgar, and we’ve \\ndecided on a course of action. Our only hope is to contain the Urgals in three \\nof the larger tunnels and channel them into Farthen Dûr so they don’t swarm \\ninside Tronjheim like locusts.\\n“I need you, \\nEragon and Arya, to help the dwarves collapse extraneous tunnels. The job is \\ntoo big for normal means. Two groups of dwarves are already working on it: one \\noutside Tronjheim, the other beneath it. Eragon, you’re to work with the group \\noutside. Arya, you’ll be with the one underground; Orik will guide you to them.”\\n“Why not \\ncollapse all the tunnels instead of leaving the large ones untouched?” asked \\nEragon.\\n“Because,” said \\nOrik, “that would force the Urgals to clear away the rubble, and they might \\ndecide to go in a direction we don’t want them to. Plus, if we cut ourselves \\noff, they could attack other dwarf cities—which we wouldn’t be able to assist \\nin time.”\\n“There’s also \\nanother reason,” said Ajihad. “Hrothgar warned me that Tronjheim sits on such a \\ndense network of tunnels that if too many are weakened, sections of the city \\nwill sink into the ground under their own weight. We can’t risk that.”\\nJörmundur \\nlistened intently, then asked, “So there won’t be any fighting inside \\nTronjheim? You said the Urgals would be channeled outside the city, into \\nFarthen Dûr.”\\nAjihad responded \\nquickly, “That’s right. We can’t defend Tronjheim’s entire perimeter—it’s too \\nbig for our forces—so we’re going to seal all the passageways and gates leading \\ninto it. That will force the Urgals out onto the flats surrounding Tronjheim, where \\nthere’s plenty of maneuvering room for our armies. Since the Urgals have access \\nto the tunnels, we cannot risk an extended battle. As long as they are here, we \\nwill be in constant danger of them quarrying up through Tronjheim’s floor. If \\nthat happens, we’ll be trapped, attacked from both the outside and inside. We \\nhave to prevent the Urgals from taking Tronjheim. If they secure it, it’s \\ndoubtful we will have the strength to roust them.”\\n“And what of our \\nfamilies?” asked Jörmundur. “I won’t see my wife and son murdered by Urgals.”\\nThe lines \\ndeepened on Ajihad’s face. “All the women and children are being evacuated into \\nthe surrounding valleys. If we are defeated, they have guides who will take \\nthem to Surda. That’s all I can do, under the circumstances.”\\nJörmundur \\nstruggled to hide his relief. “Sir, is Nasuada going as well?”\\n“She is not \\npleased, but yes.” All eyes were on Ajihad as he squared his shoulders and \\nannounced, “The Urgals will arrive in a matter of hours. We know their numbers \\nare great, but wemust hold Farthen Dûr. Failure will mean the dwarves’ \\ndownfall, death to the Varden—and eventual defeat for Surda and the elves. This \\nis one battle we cannot lose. Now go and complete your tasks! Jörmundur, ready \\nthe men to fight.”\\n\\xa0\\nThey left the \\nstudy and scattered: Jörmundur to the barracks, Orik and Arya to the stairs \\nleading underground, and Eragon and Saphira down one of Tronjheim’s four main \\nhalls. Despite the early hour, the city-mountain swarmed like an anthill. \\nPeople were running, shouting messages, and carrying bundles of belongings.\\nEragon had \\nfought and killed before, but the battle that awaited them sent stabs of fear \\ninto his chest. He had never had a chance to anticipate a fight. Now that he \\ndid, it filled him with dread. He was confident when facing only a few \\nopponents—he knew he could easily defeat three or four Urgals with Zar’roc and \\nmagic—but in a large conflict, anything could happen.\\nThey exited \\nTronjheim and looked for the dwarves they were supposed to help. Without the \\nsun or moon, the inside of Farthen Dûr was dark as lampblack, punctuated by \\nglittering lanterns bobbing jerkily in the crater.Perhaps they’re on the far \\nside of Tronjheim, suggested Saphira. Eragon agreed and swung onto her \\nback.\\nThey glided \\naround Tronjheim until a clump of lanterns came into sight. Saphira angled \\ntoward them, then with no more than a whisper landed beside a group of startled \\ndwarves who were busy digging with pickaxes. Eragon quickly explained why he \\nwas there. A sharp-nosed dwarf told him, “There’s a tunnel about four yards \\ndirectly underneath us. Any help you could give us would be appreciated.”\\n“If you clear \\nthe area over the tunnel, I’ll see what I can do.” The sharp-nosed dwarf looked \\ndoubtful, but ordered the diggers off the site.\\nBreathing slowly, \\nEragon prepared to use magic. It might be possible to actually move all the \\ndirt off the tunnel, but he needed to conserve his strength for later. Instead, \\nhe would try to collapse the tunnel by applying force to weak sections of its \\nceiling.\\n“Thrysta deloi,” \\nhe whispered and sent tentacles of power into the soil. Almost immediately they \\nencountered rock. He ignored it and reached farther down until he felt the \\nhollow emptiness of the tunnel. Then he began searching for flaws in the rock. \\nEvery time he found one, he pushed on it, elongating and widening it. It was \\nstrenuous work, but no more than it would have been to split the stone by hand. \\nHe made no visible progress—a fact that was not lost on the impatient dwarves.\\nEragon \\npersevered. Before long he was rewarded by a resounding crack that could be \\nheard clearly on the surface. There was a persistent screech, then the ground \\nslid inward like water draining from a tub, leaving a gaping hole seven yards \\nacross.\\nAs the delighted \\ndwarves walled off the tunnel with rubble, the sharp-nosed dwarf led Eragon to \\nthe next tunnel. This one was much more difficult to collapse, but he managed \\nto duplicate the feat. Over the next few hours, he collapsed over a half-dozen \\ntunnels throughout Farthen Dûr, with Saphira’s help.\\nLight crept into \\nthe small patch of sky above them as he worked. It was not enough to see by, \\nbut it bolstered Eragon’s confidence. He turned away from the crumpled ruins of \\nthe latest tunnel and surveyed the land with interest.\\nA mass exodus of \\nwomen and children, along with the Varden’s elders, streamed out of Tronjheim. \\nEveryone carried loads of provisions, clothes, and belongings. A small group of \\nwarriors, predominantly boys and old men, accompanied them.\\nMost of the \\nactivity, however, was at the base of Tronjheim, where the Varden and dwarves \\nwere assembling their army, which was divided into three battalions. Each \\nsection bore the Varden’s standard: a white dragon holding a rose above a sword \\npointing downward on a purple field.\\nThe men were silent, \\nironfisted. Their hair flowed loosely from under their helmets. Many warriors \\nhad only a sword and a shield, but there were several ranks of spear- and \\npikemen. In the rear of the battalions, archers tested their bowstrings.\\nThe dwarves were \\ngarbed in heavy battle gear. Burnished steel hauberks hung to their knees, and \\nthick roundshields, stamped with the crests of their clan, rested on their left \\narms. Short swords were sheathed at their waists, while in their right hands \\nthey carried mattocks or war axes. Their legs were covered with extra-fine \\nmail. They wore iron caps and brass-studded boots.\\nA small figure \\ndetached itself from the far battalion and hurried toward Eragon and Saphira. \\nIt was Orik, clad like the other dwarves. “Ajihad wants you to join the army,” \\nhe said. “There are no more tunnels to cave in. Food is waiting for both of \\nyou.”\\nEragon and \\nSaphira accompanied Orik to a tent, where they found bread and water for Eragon \\nand a pile of dried meat for Saphira. They ate it without complaint; it was \\nbetter than going hungry.\\nWhen they \\nfinished, Orik told them to wait and disappeared into the battalion’s ranks. He \\nreturned, leading a line of dwarves burdened with tall piles of plate armor. \\nOrik lifted a section of it and handed it to Eragon.\\n“What is this?” \\nasked Eragon, fingering the polished metal. The armor was intricately wrought \\nwith engraving and gold filigree. It was an inch thick in places and very \\nheavy. No man could fight under that much weight. And there were far too many \\npieces for one person.\\n“A gift from \\nHrothgar,” said Orik, looking pleased with himself. “It has lain so long among \\nour other treasures that it was almost forgotten. It was forged in another age, \\nbefore the fall of the Riders.”\\n“But what’s itfor \\n?” asked Eragon.\\n“Why, it’s \\ndragon armor, of course! You don’t think that dragons went into battle \\nunprotected? Complete sets are rare because they took so long to make and \\nbecause dragons were always growing. Still, Saphira isn’t too big yet, so this \\nshould fit her reasonably well.”\\nDragon armor!As Saphira nosed \\none of the pieces, Eragon asked,What do you think?\\nLet’s try it on,she said, a \\nfierce gleam in her eye.\\nAfter a good \\ndeal of struggling, Eragon and Orik stepped back to admire the result. \\nSaphira’s entire neck—except for the spikes along its ridge—was covered with \\ntriangular scales of overlapping armor. Her belly and chest were protected by \\nthe heaviest plates, while the lightest ones were on her tail. Her legs and \\nback were completely encased. Her wings were left bare. A single molded plate \\nlay on top of her head, leaving her lower jaw free to bite and snap.\\nSaphira arched \\nher neck experimentally, and the armor flexed smoothly with her.This will \\nslow me down, but it’ll help stop the arrows. How do I look?\\nVery intimidating,replied Eragon \\ntruthfully. That pleased her.\\nOrik picked up \\nthe remaining items from the ground. “I brought you armor as well, though it \\ntook much searching to find your size. We rarely forge arms for men or elves. I \\ndon’t know who this was made for, but it has never been used and should serve \\nyou well.”\\nOver Eragon’s \\nhead went a stiff shirt of leather-backed mail that fell to his knees like a \\nskirt. It rested heavily on his shoulders and clinked when he moved. He belted \\nZar’roc over it, which helped keep the mail from swinging. On his head went a \\nleather cap, then a mail coif, and finally a gold-and-silver helm. Bracers were \\nstrapped to his forearms, and greaves to his lower legs. For his hands there \\nwere mail-backed gloves. Last, Orik handed him a broad shield emblazoned with \\nan oak tree.\\nKnowing that \\nwhat he and Saphira had been given was worth several fortunes, Eragon bowed and \\nsaid, “Thank you for these gifts. Hrothgar’s presents are greatly appreciated.”\\n“Don’t give \\nthanks now,” said Orik with a chuckle. “Wait until the armor saves your life.”\\nThe warriors \\naround them began marching away. The three battalions were repositioning \\nthemselves in different parts of Farthen Dûr. Unsure of what they should do, \\nEragon looked at Orik, who shrugged and said, “I suppose we should accompany \\nthem.” They trailed behind a battalion as it headed toward the crater wall. \\nEragon asked about the Urgals, but Orik only knew that scouts had been posted \\nunderground in the tunnels and that nothing had been seen or heard yet.\\nThe battalion \\nhalted at one of the collapsed tunnels. The dwarves had piled the rubble so \\nthat anyone inside the tunnel could easily climb out.This must be one of the \\nplaces they’re going to force the Urgals to surface, Saphira pointed out.\\nHundreds of \\nlanterns were fixed atop poles and stuck into the ground. They provided a great \\npool of light that glowed like an evening sun. Fires blazed along the rim of \\nthe tunnel’s roof, huge cauldrons of pitch heating over them. Eragon looked \\naway, fighting back revulsion. It was a terrible way to kill anyone, even an \\nUrgal.\\nRows of \\nsharpened saplings were being pounded into the ground to provide a thorny \\nbarrier between the battalion and the tunnel. Eragon saw an opportunity to help \\nand joined a group of men digging trenches between the saplings. Saphira \\nassisted as well, scooping out the dirt with her giant claws. While they \\nlabored, Orik left to supervise the construction of a barricade to shield the \\narchers. Eragon drank gratefully from the wineskin whenever it was passed \\naround. After the trenches were finished and filled with pointed stakes, \\nSaphira and Eragon rested.\\nOrik returned to \\nfind them seated together. He wiped his brow. “All the men and dwarves are on \\nthe battlefield. Tronjheim has been sealed off. Hrothgar has taken charge of \\nthe battalion to our left. Ajihad leads the one ahead of us.”\\n“Who commands \\nthis one?”\\n“Jörmundur.” \\nOrik sat with a grunt and placed his war ax on the ground.\\nSaphira nudged \\nEragon.Look. His hand tightened on Zar’roc as he saw Murtagh, helmed, \\ncarrying a dwarven shield and his hand-and-a-half sword, approaching with \\nTornac.\\nOrik cursed and \\nleapt to his feet, but Murtagh said quickly, “It’s all right; Ajihad released \\nme.”\\n“Why would he do \\nthat?” demanded Orik.\\nMurtagh smiled \\nwryly. “He said this was an opportunity to prove my good intentions. \\nApparently, he doesn’t think I would be able to do much damage even if I did \\nturn on the Varden.”\\nEragon nodded in \\nwelcome, relaxing his grip. Murtagh was an excellent and merciless \\nfighter—exactly whom Eragon wanted by his side during battle.\\n“How do we know \\nyou’re not lying?” asked Orik.\\n“Because I say \\nso,” announced a firm voice. Ajihad strode into their midst, armed for battle \\nwith a breastplate and an ivory-handled sword. He put a strong hand on Eragon’s \\nshoulder and drew him away where the others could not hear. He cast an eye over \\nEragon’s armor. “Good, Orik outfitted you.”\\n“Yes . . . has \\nanything been seen in the tunnels?”\\n“Nothing.” \\nAjihad leaned on his sword. “One of the Twins is staying in Tronjheim. He’s \\ngoing to watch the battle from the dragonhold and relay information through his \\nbrother to me. I know you can speak with your mind. I need you to tell the \\nTwins anything,anything, unusual that you see while fighting. Also, I’ll \\nrelay orders to you through them. Do you understand?”\\nThe thought of \\nbeing linked to the Twins filled Eragon with loathing, but he knew it was \\nnecessary. “I do.”\\nAjihad paused. \\n“You’re not a foot soldier or horseman, nor any other type of warrior I’m used \\nto commanding. Battle may prove differently, but I think you and Saphira will \\nbe safer on the ground. In the air, you’ll be a choice target for Urgal \\narchers. Will you fight from Saphira’s back?”\\nEragon had never \\nbeen in combat on horseback, much less on Saphira. “I’m not sure what we’ll do. \\nWhen I’m on Saphira, I’m up too high to fight all but a Kull.”\\n“There will be \\nplenty of Kull, I’m afraid,” said Ajihad. He straightened, pulling his sword \\nout of the ground. “The only advice I can give you is to avoid unnecessary \\nrisks. The Varden cannot afford to lose you.” With that, he turned and left.\\nEragon returned \\nto Orik and Murtagh and hunkered next to Saphira, leaning his shield against \\nhis knees. The four of them waited in silence like the hundreds of warriors \\naround them. Light from Farthen Dûr’s opening waned as the sun crept below the \\ncrater rim.\\nEragon turned to \\nscan the encampment and froze, heart jolting. About thirty feet away sat Arya \\nwith her bow in her lap. Though he knew it was unreasonable, he had hoped she \\nmight accompany the other women out of Farthen Dûr. Concerned, he hastened to \\nher. “You will fight?”\\n“I do what I \\nmust,” Arya said calmly.\\n“But it’s too \\ndangerous!”\\nHer face \\ndarkened. “Do not pamper me, human. Elves train both their men and women to \\nfight. I am not one of your helpless females to run away whenever there is \\ndanger. I was given the task of protecting Saphira’s egg . . . which I failed. \\nMy breoal is dishonored and would be further shamed if I did not guard you and \\nSaphira on this field. You forget that I am stronger with magic than any here, \\nincluding you. If the Shade comes, who can defeat him but me? And who else has \\nthe right?”\\nEragon stared at \\nher helplessly, knowing she was right and hating the fact. “Then stay safe.” Out \\nof desperation, he added in the ancient language, “Wiol pömnuria ilian.” For my \\nhappiness.\\nArya turned her \\ngaze away uneasily, the fringe of her hair obscuring her face. She ran a hand \\nalong her polished bow, then murmured, “It is my wyrd to be here. The debt must \\nbe paid.”\\nHe abruptly \\nretreated to Saphira. Murtagh looked at him curiously. “What did she say?”\\n“Nothing.”\\nWrapped in their \\nown thoughts, the defenders sank into a brooding silence as the hours crawled \\nby. Farthen Dûr’s crater again grew black, except for the sanguine lantern glow \\nand the fires heating the pitch. Eragon alternated between myopically examining \\nthe links of his mail and spying on Arya. Orik repeatedly ran a whetstone over \\nthe blade of his ax, periodically eyeing the edge between strokes; the rasp of \\nmetal on stone was irritating. Murtagh just stared into the distance.\\nOccasionally, \\nmessengers ran through the encampment, causing the warriors to surge to their \\nfeet. But it always proved to be a false alarm. The men and dwarves became \\nstrained; angry voices were often heard. The worst part about Farthen Dûr was \\nthe lack of wind—the air was dead, motionless. Even when it grew warm and \\nstifling and filled with smoke, there was no reprieve.\\nAs the night \\ndragged on, the battlefield stilled, silent as death. Muscles stiffened from \\nthe waiting. Eragon stared blankly into the darkness with heavy eyelids. He \\nshook himself to alertness and tried to focus through his stupor.\\nFinally Orik \\nsaid, “It’s late. We should sleep. If anything happens, the others will wake \\nus.” Murtagh grumbled, but Eragon was too tired to complain. He curled up \\nagainst Saphira, using his shield as a pillow. As his eyes closed, he saw that \\nArya was still awake, watching over them.\\nHis dreams were \\nconfused and disturbing, full of horned beasts and unseen menaces. Over and \\nover he heard a deep voice ask, “Are you ready?” But he never had an answer. \\nPlagued by such visions, his sleep was shallow and uneasy until something \\ntouched his arm. He woke with a start.\\nB ATTLEUNDER \\nFARTHENDÛR\\n“It has begun,” \\nArya said with a sorrowful expression. The troops in the encampment stood \\nalertly with their weapons drawn. Orik swung his ax to make sure he had enough \\nroom. Arya nocked an arrow and held it ready to shoot.\\n“A scout ran out \\nof a tunnel a few minutes ago,” said Murtagh to Eragon. “The Urgals are \\ncoming.”\\nTogether they \\nwatched the dark mouth of the tunnel through the ranks of men and sharpened \\nstakes. A minute dragged by, then another . . . and another. Without taking his \\neyes from the tunnel, Eragon hoisted himself into Saphira’s saddle, Zar’roc in \\nhis hand, a comfortable weight. Murtagh mounted Tornac beside him. Then a man \\ncried, “I hear them!”\\nThe warriors \\nstiffened; grips tightened on weapons. No one moved . . . no one breathed. \\nSomewhere a horse nickered.\\nHarsh Urgal \\nshouts shattered the air as dark shapes boiled upward in the tunnel’s opening. \\nAt a command, the cauldrons of pitch were tilted on their sides, pouring the \\nscalding liquid into the tunnel’s hungry throat. The monsters howled in pain, \\narms flailing. A torch was thrown onto the bubbling pitch, and an orange pillar \\nof greasy flames roared up in the opening, engulfing the Urgals in an inferno. \\nSickened, Eragon looked across Farthen Dûr at the other two battalions and saw \\nsimilar fires by each. He sheathed Zar’roc and strung his bow.\\nMore Urgals soon \\ntamped the pitch down and clambered out of the tunnels over their burned \\nbrethren. They clumped together, presenting a solid wall to the men and \\ndwarves. Behind the palisade Orik had helped build, the first row of archers \\npulled on their bows and fired. Eragon and Arya added their arrows to the \\ndeadly swarm and watched the shafts eat through the Urgals’ ranks.\\nThe Urgal line \\nwavered, threatening to break, but they covered themselves with their shields \\nand weathered the attack. Again the archers fired, but the Urgals continued to \\nstream onto the surface at a ferocious rate.\\nEragon was \\ndismayed by their numbers. They were supposed to kill every single one? It \\nseemed a madman’s task. His only encouragement was that he saw none of \\nGalbatorix’s troops with the Urgals. Not yet, at least.\\nThe opposing \\narmy formed a solid mass of bodies that seemed to stretch endlessly. Tattered \\nand sullen standards were raised in the monsters’ midst. Baleful notes echoed \\nthrough Farthen Dûr as war horns sounded. The entire group of Urgals charged \\nwith savage war cries.\\nThey dashed \\nagainst the rows of stakes, covering them with slick blood and limp corpses as \\nthe ranks at the vanguard were crushed against the posts. A cloud of black \\narrows flew over the barrier at the crouched defenders. Eragon ducked behind \\nhis shield, and Saphira covered her head. Arrows rattled harmlessly against her \\narmor.\\nMomentarily \\nfoiled by the pickets, the Urgal horde milled with confusion. The Varden \\nbunched together, waiting for the next attack. After a pause, the war cries \\nwere raised again as the Urgals surged forward. The assault was bitter. Its \\nmomentum carried the Urgals through the stakes, where a line of pikemen jabbed \\nfrantically at their ranks, trying to repel them. The pikemen held briefly, but \\nthe ominous tide of Urgals could not be halted, and they were overwhelmed.\\nThe first lines \\nof defense breached, the main bodies of the two forces collided for the first \\ntime. A deafening roar burst from the men and dwarves as they rushed into the \\nconflict. Saphira bellowed and leapt toward the fight, diving into a whirlwind \\nof noise and blurred action.\\nWith her jaws \\nand talons, Saphira tore through an Urgal. Her teeth were as lethal as any \\nsword, her tail a giant mace. From her back, Eragon parried a hammer blow from \\nan Urgal chief, protecting her vulnerable wings. Zar’roc’s crimson blade seemed \\nto gleam with delight as blood spurted along its length.\\nFrom the corner \\nof his eye, Eragon saw Orik hewing Urgal necks with mighty blows of his ax. \\nBeside the dwarf was Murtagh on Tornac, his face disfigured by a vicious snarl \\nas he swung his sword angrily, cutting through every defense. Then Saphira spun \\naround, and Eragon saw Arya leap past the lifeless body of an opponent.\\nAn Urgal bowled \\nover a wounded dwarf and hacked at Saphira’s front right leg. His sword skated \\noff her armor with a burst of sparks. Eragon smote him on the head, but Zar’roc \\nstuck in the monster’s horns and was yanked from his grasp. With a curse he \\ndived off Saphira and tackled the Urgal, smashing his face with the shield. He \\njerked Zar’roc out of the horns, then dodged as another Urgal charged him.\\nSaphira, I need \\nyou!he \\nshouted, but the battle’s tide had separated them. Suddenly a Kull jumped at \\nhim, club raised for a blow. Unable to lift his shield in time, Eragon uttered, \\n“Jierda!” The Kull’s head snapped back with a sharp report as his neck broke. \\nFour more Urgals succumbed to Zar’roc’s thirsty bite, then Murtagh rode up \\nbeside Eragon, driving the press of Urgals backward.\\n“Come on!” he \\nshouted, and reached down from Tornac, pulling Eragon onto the horse. They \\nrushed toward Saphira, who was embroiled in a mass of enemies. Twelve spear-wielding \\nUrgals encircled her, needling her with their lances. They had already managed \\nto prick both of her wings. Her blood splattered the ground. Every time she \\nrushed at one of the Urgals, they bunched together and jabbed at her eyes, \\nforcing her to retreat. She tried to sweep the spears away with her talons, but \\nthe Urgals jumped back and evaded her.\\nThe sight of \\nSaphira’s blood enraged Eragon. He swung off Tornac with a wild cry and stabbed \\nthe nearest Urgal through the chest, withholding nothing in his frenzied \\nattempt to help Saphira. His attack provided the distraction she needed to \\nbreak free. With a kick, she sent an Urgal flying, then barreled to him. Eragon \\ngrabbed one of her neck spikes and pulled himself back into her saddle. Murtagh \\nraised his hand, then charged into another knot of Urgals.\\nBy unspoken \\nconsent, Saphira took flight and rose above the struggling armies, seeking a \\nrespite from the madness. Eragon’s breath trembled. His muscles were clenched, \\nready to ward off the next attack. Every fiber of his being thrilled with \\nenergy, making him feel more alive than ever before.\\nSaphira circled \\nlong enough for them to recover their strength, then descended toward the \\nUrgals, skimming the ground to avoid detection. She approached the monsters from \\nbehind, where their archers were gathered.\\nBefore the \\nUrgals realized what was happening, Eragon lopped off the heads of two archers, \\nand Saphira disemboweled three others. She took off again as alarms sounded, \\nquickly soaring out of bow range.\\nThey repeated \\nthe tactic on a different flank of the army. Saphira’s stealth and speed, \\ncombined with the dim lighting, made it nearly impossible for the Urgals to \\npredict where she would strike next. Eragon used his bow whenever Saphira was \\nin the air, but he quickly ran out of arrows. Soon the only thing left in his \\nquiver was magic, which he wanted to keep in reserve until it was desperately \\nneeded.\\nSaphira’s \\nflights over the combatants gave Eragon a unique understanding of how the \\nbattle was progressing. There were three separate fights raging in Farthen Dûr, \\none by each open tunnel. The Urgals were disadvantaged by the dispersal of \\ntheir forces and their inability to get all of their army out of the tunnels at \\nonce. Even so, the Varden and dwarves could not keep the monsters from \\nadvancing and were slowly being driven back toward Tronjheim. The defenders \\nseemed insignificant against the mass of Urgals, whose numbers continued to \\nincrease as they poured out of the tunnels.\\nThe Urgals had \\norganized themselves around several standards, each representing a clan, but it \\nwas unclear who commanded them overall. The clans paid no attention to each \\nother, as if they were receiving orders from elsewhere. Eragon wished he knew \\nwho was in charge so he and Saphira could kill him.\\nRemembering \\nAjihad’s orders, he began relaying information to the Twins. They were \\ninterested by what he had to say about the Urgals’ apparent lack of a leader \\nand questioned him closely. The exchange was smooth, if brief. The Twins told \\nhim,You’re ordered to assist Hrothgar; the fight goes badly for him.\\nUnderstood,Eragon \\nresponded.\\nSaphira swiftly \\nflew to the besieged dwarves, swooping low over Hrothgar. Arrayed in golden \\narmor, the dwarf king stood at the fore of a small knot of his kin, wielding Volund, \\nthe hammer of his ancestors. His white beard caught the lantern light as he \\nlooked up at Saphira. Admiration glinted in his eyes.\\nSaphira landed \\nbeside the dwarves and faced the oncoming Urgals. Even the bravest Kull quailed \\nbefore her ferocity, allowing the dwarves to surge forward. Eragon tried to \\nkeep Saphira safe. Her left flank was protected by the dwarves, but to her \\nfront and right raged a sea of enemies. He showed no mercy on those and took \\nevery advantage he could, using magic whenever Zar’roc could not serve him. A \\nspear bounced off his shield, denting it and leaving him with a bruised \\nshoulder. Shaking off the pain, he cleaved open an Urgal’s skull, mixing brains \\nwith metal and bone.\\nHe was in awe of \\nHrothgar—who, though he was ancient by both the standards of men and dwarves, \\nwas still undiminished on the battlefield. No Urgal, Kull or not, could stand \\nbefore the dwarf king and his guards and live. Every time Volund struck, it \\nsounded the gong of death for another enemy. After a spear downed one of his \\nwarriors, Hrothgar grabbed the spear himself and, with astounding strength, \\nhurled it completely through its owner twenty yards away. Such heroism \\nemboldened Eragon to ever greater risks, seeking to hold his own with the \\nmighty king.\\nEragon lunged at \\na giant Kull nearly out of reach and almost fell from Saphira’s saddle. Before \\nhe could recover, the Kull darted past Saphira’s defenses and swung his sword. \\nThe brunt of the blow caught Eragon on the side of his helm, throwing him \\nbackward and making his vision flicker and his ears ring thunderously.\\nStunned, he \\ntried to pull himself upright, but the Kull had already prepared for another \\nblow. As the Kull’s arm descended, a slim steel blade suddenly sprouted from \\nhis chest. Howling, the monster toppled to the side. In his place stood Angela.\\nThe witch wore a \\nlong red cape over outlandish flanged armor enameled black and green. She bore \\na strange two-handed weapon—a long wooden shaft with a sword blade attached to \\neach end. Angela winked at Eragon mischievously, then dashed away, spinning her \\nstaff-sword like a dervish. Close behind her was Solembum in the form of a \\nyoung shaggy-haired boy. He held a small black dagger, sharp teeth bared in a \\nferal snarl.\\nStill dazed from \\nhis battering, Eragon managed to straighten himself in the saddle. Saphira \\njumped into the air and wheeled high above, letting him recuperate. He scanned \\nFarthen Dûr’s plains and saw, to his dismay, that all three battles were going \\nbadly. Neither Ajihad, Jörmundur, nor Hrothgar could stop the Urgals. There \\nwere simply too many.\\nEragon wondered \\nhow many Urgals he could kill at once with magic. He knew his limits fairly \\nwell. If he were to kill enough to make a difference . . . it would probably be \\nsuicide. That might be what it took to win.\\nThe fighting \\ncontinued for one endless hour after another. The Varden and dwarves were \\nexhausted, but the Urgals remained fresh with reinforcements.\\nIt was a \\nnightmare for Eragon. Though he and Saphira fought their hardest, there was \\nalways another Urgal to take the place of the one just killed. His whole body \\nhurt—especially his head. Every time he used magic he lost a little more \\nenergy. Saphira was in better condition, though her wings were punctured with \\nsmall wounds.\\nAs he parried a \\nblow, the Twins contacted him urgently.There are loud noises under \\nTronjheim. It sounds like Urgals are trying to dig into the city! We need you \\nand Arya to collapse any tunnels they’re excavating.\\nEragon \\ndispatched his opponent with a sword thrust.We’ll be right there. He \\nlooked for Arya and saw her engaged with a knot of struggling Urgals. Saphira \\nquickly forged a path to the elf, leaving a pile of crumpled bodies in her \\nwake. Eragon extended his hand and said, “Get on!”\\nArya jumped onto \\nSaphira’s back without hesitation. She wrapped her right arm around Eragon’s \\nwaist, wielding her bloodstained sword with the other. As Saphira crouched to \\ntake off, an Urgal ran at her, howling, then lifted an ax and smashed her in \\nthe chest.\\nSaphira roared \\nwith pain and lurched forward, feet leaving the ground. Her wings snapped open, \\nstraining to keep them from crashing as she veered wildly to one side, right \\nwingtip scraping the ground. Below them, the Urgal pulled back his arm to throw \\nthe ax. But Arya raised her palm, shouting, and an emerald ball of energy shot \\nfrom her hand, killing the Urgal. With a colossal heave of her shoulders, \\nSaphira righted herself, barely making it over the heads of the warriors. She \\npulled away from the battlefield with powerful wing strokes and rasping breath.\\nAre you all \\nright?asked \\nEragon, concerned. He could not see where she had been struck.\\nI’ll live,she said grimly,but \\nthe front of my armor has been crushed together.It hurts my chest, and I’m \\nhaving trouble moving.\\nCan you get us \\nto the dragonhold?\\n\\n. . . We’ll see. \\nEragon explained \\nSaphira’s condition to Arya. “I’ll stay and help Saphira when we land,” she \\noffered. “Once she is free of the armor, I will join you.”\\n“Thank you,” he \\nsaid. The flight was laborious for Saphira; she glided whenever she could. When \\nthey reached the dragonhold, she dropped heavily to Isidar Mithrim, where the \\nTwins were supposed to be watching the battle, but it was empty. Eragon jumped \\nto the floor and winced as he saw the damage the Urgal had done. Four of the \\nmetal plates on Saphira’s chest had been hammered together, restricting her \\nability to bend and breathe. “Stay well,” he said, putting a hand on her side, \\nthen ran out the archway.\\nHe stopped and \\nswore. He was at the top of Vol Turin, The Endless Staircase. Because of his \\nworry for Saphira, he had not considered how he would get to Tronjheim’s \\nbase—where the Urgals were breaking in. There was no time to climb down. He \\nlooked at the narrow trough to the right of the stairs, then grabbed one of the \\nleather pads and threw himself down on it.\\nThe stone slide \\nwas smooth as lacquered wood. With the leather underneath him, he accelerated \\nalmost instantly to a frightening speed, the walls blurring and the curve of \\nthe slide pressing him high against the wall. Eragon lay completely flat so he \\nwould go faster. The air rushed past his helm, making it vibrate like a weather \\nvane in a gale. The trough was too confined for him, and he was perilously \\nclose to flying out, but as long as he kept his arms and legs still, he was \\nsafe.\\nIt was a swift \\ndescent, but it still took him nearly ten minutes to reach the bottom. The \\nslide leveled out at the end and sent him skidding halfway across the huge \\ncarnelian floor.\\nWhen he finally \\ncame to a stop, he was too dizzy to walk. His first attempt to stand made him \\nnauseated, so he curled up, head in his hands, and waited for things to stop \\nspinning. When he felt better, he stood and warily looked around.\\nThe great \\nchamber was completely deserted, the silence unsettling. Rosy light filtered \\ndown from Isidar Mithrim. He faltered—Where was he supposed to go?—and cast out \\nhis mind for the Twins. Nothing. He froze as loud knocking echoed through \\nTronjheim.\\nAn explosion \\nsplit the air. A long slab of the chamber floor buckled and blew thirty feet \\nup. Needles of rocks flew outward as it crashed down. Eragon stumbled back, \\nstunned, groping for Zar’roc. The twisted shapes of Urgals clambered out of the \\nhole in the floor.\\nEragon \\nhesitated. Should he flee? Or should he stay and try to close the tunnel? Even \\nif he managed to seal it before the Urgals attacked him, what if Tronjheim was \\nalready breached elsewhere? He could not find all the places in time to prevent \\nthe city-mountain from being captured.But if I run to one of Tronjheim’s \\ngates and blast it open, the Varden could retake Tronjheim without having to \\nsiege it. Before he could decide, a tall man garbed entirely in black armor \\nemerged from the tunnel and looked directly at him.\\nIt was Durza.\\nThe Shade \\ncarried his pale blade marked with the scratch from Ajihad. A black roundshield \\nwith a crimson ensign rested on his arm. His dark helmet was richly decorated, \\nlike a general’s, and a long snakeskin cloak billowed around him. Madness \\nburned in his maroon eyes, the madness of one who enjoys power and finds himself \\nin the position to use it.\\nEragon knew he \\nwas neither fast enough nor strong enough to escape the fiend before him. He \\nimmediately warned Saphira, though he knew it was impossible for her to rescue \\nhim. He dropped into a crouch and quickly reviewed what Brom had told him about \\nfighting another magic user. It was not encouraging. And Ajihad had said that \\nShades could only be destroyed by a thrust through the heart.\\nDurza gazed at \\nhim contemptuously and said, “Kaz jtierl trazhid! Otrag bagh.” The Urgals eyed \\nEragon suspiciously and formed a circle around the perimeter of the room. Durza \\nslowly approached Eragon with a triumphant expression. “So, my young Rider, we \\nmeet again. You were foolish to escape from me in Gil’ead. It will only make \\nthings worse for you in the end.”\\n“You’ll never \\ncapture me alive,” growled Eragon.\\n“Is that so?” \\nasked the Shade, raising an eyebrow. The light from the star sapphire gave his \\nskin a ghastly tint. “I don’t see your ‘friend’ Murtagh around to help you. You \\ncan’t stop me now. No one can!”\\nFear touched \\nEragon.How does he know about Murtagh? Putting all the derision he could \\ninto his voice, he jeered, “How did you like being shot?”\\nDurza’s face \\ntightened momentarily. “I will be repaid in blood for that. Now tell me where \\nyour dragon is hiding.”\\n“Never.”\\nThe Shade’s \\ncountenance darkened. “Then I will force it from you!” His sword whistled \\nthrough the air. The moment Eragon caught the blade on his shield, a mental \\nprobe spiked deep into his thoughts. Fighting to protect his consciousness, he \\nshoved Durza back and attacked with his own mind.\\nEragon battered \\nwith all his strength against the iron-hard defenses surrounding Durza’s mind, \\nbut to no avail. He swung Zar’roc, trying to catch Durza off guard. The Shade \\nknocked the blow aside effortlessly, then stabbed in return with lightning \\nspeed.\\nThe point of the \\nsword caught Eragon in the ribs, piercing his mail and driving out his breath. \\nThe mail slipped, though, and the blade missed his side by the width of a wire. \\nThe distraction was all Durza needed to break into Eragon’s mind and begin \\ntaking control.\\n“No!” cried \\nEragon, throwing himself at the Shade. His face contorted as he grappled with \\nDurza, yanking on his sword arm. Durza tried to cut Eragon’s hand, but it was \\nprotected by the mail-backed glove, which sent the blade glancing downward. As \\nEragon kicked his leg, Durza snarled and swept his black shield around, \\nknocking him to the floor. Eragon tasted blood in his mouth; his neck throbbed. \\nIgnoring his injuries, he rolled over and hurled his shield at Durza. Despite \\nthe Shade’s superior speed, the heavy shield clipped him on the hip. As Durza \\nstumbled, Eragon caught him on the upper arm with Zar’roc. A line of blood \\ntraced down the Shade’s arm.\\nEragon thrust at \\nthe Shade with his mind and drove through Durza’s weakened defenses. A flood of \\nimages suddenly engulfed him, rushing through his consciousness—\\n\\xa0\\nDurza as a young \\nboy living as a nomad with his parents on the empty plains. The tribe abandoned \\nthem and called his father “oathbreaker.” Only it was not Durza then, but \\nCarsaib—the name his mother crooned while combing his hair. . . . \\n\\xa0\\nThe Shade reeled \\nwildly, face twisted in pain. Eragon tried to control the torrent of memories, \\nbut the force of them was overwhelming.\\n\\xa0\\nStanding on a \\nhill over the graves of his parents, weeping that the men had not killed him as \\nwell. Then turning and stumbling blindly away, into the desert. . . . \\n\\xa0\\nDurza faced \\nEragon. Terrible hatred flowed from his maroon eyes. Eragon was on one \\nknee—almost standing—struggling to seal his mind.\\n\\xa0\\nHow the old man \\nlooked when he first saw Carsaib lying near death on a sand dune. The days it \\nhad taken Carsaib to recover and the fear he felt upon discovering that his \\nrescuer was a sorcerer. How he had pleaded to be taught the control of spirits. \\nHow Haeg had finally agreed. Called him “Desert Rat.”. . . \\n\\xa0\\nEragon was \\nstanding now. Durza charged . . . sword raised . . . shield ignored in his \\nfury.\\n\\xa0\\nThe days spent \\ntraining under the scorching sun, always alert for the lizards they caught for \\nfood. How his power slowly grew, giving him pride and confidence. The weeks \\nspent nursing his sick master after a failed spell. His joy when Haeg recovered \\n. . .\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThere was not \\nenough time to react . . . not enough time. . . .\\n\\xa0\\nThe bandits who \\nattacked during the night, killing Haeg. The rage Carsaib had felt and the \\nspirits he had summoned for vengeance. But the spirits were stronger than he \\nexpected. They turned on him, possessing mind and body. He had screamed. He \\nwas—I AM DURZA!\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe sword smote \\nheavily across Eragon’s back, cutting through both mail and skin. He screamed \\nas pain blasted through him, forcing him to his knees. Agony bowed his body in \\nhalf and obliterated all thought. He swayed, barely conscious, hot blood running \\ndown the small of his back. Durza said something he could not hear.\\nIn anguish, \\nEragon raised his eyes to the heavens, tears streaming down his cheeks. \\nEverything had failed. The Varden and dwarves were destroyed. He was defeated. \\nSaphira would give herself up for his sake—she had done it before—and Arya \\nwould be recaptured or killed. Why had it ended like this? What justice could \\nthis be? All was for nothing.\\nAs he looked at \\nIsidar Mithrim far above his tortured frame, a flash of light erupted in his \\neyes, blinding him. A second later, the chamber rang with a deafening report. \\nThen his eyes cleared, and he gaped with disbelief.\\nThe star \\nsapphire had shattered. An expanding torus of huge dagger-like pieces plummeted \\ntoward the distant floor—the shimmering shards near the walls. In the center of \\nthe chamber, hurtling downward headfirst, was Saphira. Her jaws were open and \\nfrom between them erupted a great tongue of flame, bright yellow and tinged \\nwith blue. On her back was Arya: hair billowing wildly, arm uplifted, palm \\nglowing with a nimbus of green magic.\\nTime seemed to \\nslow as Eragon saw Durza tilt his head toward the ceiling. First shock, then \\nanger contorted the Shade’s face. Sneering defiantly, he raised his hand and \\npointed at Saphira, a word forming on his lips.\\nA hidden reserve \\nof strength suddenly welled up inside Eragon, dredged from the deepest part of \\nhis being. His fingers curled around the hilt of his sword. He plunged through \\nthe barrier in his mind and took hold of the magic. All his pain and rage \\nfocused on one word:\\n“Brisingr!” \\nZar’roc blazed \\nwith bloody light, heatless flames running along it . . .\\nHe lunged \\nforward . . .\\nAnd stabbed \\nDurza in the heart.\\nDurza looked \\ndown with shock at the blade protruding from his breast. His mouth was open, \\nbut instead of words, an unearthly howl burst from him. His sword dropped from \\nnerveless fingers. He grasped Zar’roc as if to pull it out, but it was lodged \\nfirmly in him.\\nThen Durza’s \\nskin turned transparent. Under it was neither flesh nor bone, but swirling \\npatterns of darkness. He shrieked even louder as the darkness pulsated, \\nsplitting his skin. With one last cry, Durza was rent from head to toe, \\nreleasing the darkness, which separated into three entities who flew through \\nTronjheim’s walls and out of Farthen Dûr. The Shade was gone.\\nBereft of \\nstrength, Eragon fell back with arms outstretched. Above him, Saphira and Arya \\nhad nearly reached the floor—it looked as if they were going to smash into it \\nwith the deadly remains of Isidar Mithrim. As his sight faded, Saphira, Arya, \\nthe myriad fragments—all seemed to stop falling and hang motionless in the air.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 46': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nT HEMOURNINGSAGE\\nS natches of \\nthe Shade’s memories continued to flash through Eragon. A whirlwind of dark \\nevents and emotions overwhelmed him, making it impossible to think. Submerged \\nin the maelstrom, he knew neither who nor where he was. He was too weak to \\ncleanse himself of the alien presence that clouded his mind. Violent, cruel \\nimages from the Shade’s past exploded behind his eyes until his spirit cried \\nout in anguish at the bloody sights. \\nA pile of bodies \\nrose before him . . . innocents slaughtered by the Shade’s orders. He saw still \\nmore corpses—whole villages of them—taken from life by the sorcerer’s hand or \\nword. There was no escape from the carnage that surrounded him. He wavered like \\na candle flame, unable to withstand the tide of evil. He prayed for someone to \\nlift him out of the nightmare, but there was no one to guide him. If only he \\ncould remember what he was supposed to be: boy or man, villain or hero, Shade \\nor Rider; all was jumbled together in a meaningless frenzy. He was lost, \\ncompletely and utterly, in the roiling mass. \\nSuddenly a \\ncluster of his own memories burst through the dismal cloud left by the Shade’s \\nmalevolent mind. All the events since he had found Saphira’s egg came to him in \\nthe cold light of revelation. His accomplishments and failures were displayed \\nequally. He had lost much that was dear to him, yet fate had given him rare and \\ngreat gifts; for the first time, he was proud of simply who he was. As if in \\nresponse to his brief self-confidence, the Shade’s smothering blackness \\nassaulted him anew. His identity trailed into the void as uncertainty and fear \\nconsumed his perceptions. Who was he to think he could challenge the powers of \\nAlagaësia and live?\\n\\nHe fought \\nagainst the Shade’s sinister thoughts, weakly at first, then more strongly. He \\nwhispered words of the ancient language and found they gave him enough strength \\nto withstand the shadow blurring his mind. Though his defenses faltered \\ndangerously, he slowly began to draw his shattered consciousness into a small \\nbright shell around his core. Outside his mind he was aware of a pain so great \\nit threatened to blot out his very life, but something—or someone—seemed to \\nkeep it at bay.\\n\\nHe was still too \\nweak to clear his mind completely, but he was lucid enough to examine his \\nexperiences since Carvahall. Where would he go now . . . and who would show him \\nthe way? Without Brom, there was no one to guide or teach him. \\nCome to me.\\nHe recoiled at \\nthe touch of another consciousness—one so vast and powerful it was like a \\nmountain looming over him. This was who was blocking the pain, he realized. \\nLike Arya’s mind, music ran through this one: deep amber-gold chords that \\nthrobbed with magisterial melancholy. \\nFinally, he \\ndared ask,Who \\n. . . who are you?\\nOne who would \\nhelp.With a flicker of an unspoken thought, the Shade’s influence was \\nbrushed aside like an unwanted cobweb. Freed from the oppressive weight, Eragon \\nlet his mind expand until he touched a barrier beyond which he could not pass.I \\nhave protected you as best I can, but you are so far away I can do no more than \\nshield your sanity from the pain.\\nAgain:Who are you to \\ndo this?\\nThere was a low \\nrumble.I \\nam Osthato Chetowä, the Mourning Sage. And Togira Ikonoka, the Cripple Who Is \\nWhole. Come to me, Eragon, for I have answers to all you ask. You will not be \\nsafe until you find me.\\nBut how can I \\nfind you if I don’t know where you are?he asked, despairing.\\nTrust Arya and \\ngo with her to Ellesméra—I will be there. I have waited many seasons, so do not \\ndelay or it may soon be too late. . . . You are greater than you know, Eragon. \\nThink of what you have done and rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great \\nevil. You have wrought a deed no one else could. Many are in your debt.\\nThe stranger was \\nright; what he had accomplished was worthy of honor, of recognition. No matter \\nwhat his trials might be in the future, he was no longer just a pawn in the \\ngame of power. He had transcended that and was something else, something more. \\nHe had become what Ajihad wanted: an authority independent of any king or \\nleader.\\n\\nHe sensed \\napproval as he reached that conclusion.You are learning,said the Mourning Sage, \\ndrawing nearer. A vision passed from him to Eragon: a burst of color blossomed \\nin his mind, resolving into a stooped figure dressed in white, standing on a \\nsun-drenched stone cliff.It is time for you to rest, Eragon. When you wake, \\ndo not speak of me to anyone,said the figure kindly, face obscured by a \\nsilver nimbus. Remember, you must go to the elves. Now, sleep. . . .He \\nraised a hand, as if in benediction, and peace crept through Eragon.\\nHis last thought \\nwas that Brom would have been proud of him. \\n\\xa0\\n“Wake,” \\ncommanded the voice. “Awake, Eragon, for you have slept far too long.” He \\nstirred unwillingly, loath to listen. The warmth that surrounded him was too \\ncomfortable to leave. The voice sounded again. “Rise, Argetlam! You are \\nneeded!”\\nHe reluctantly forced \\nhis eyes open and found himself on a long bed, swathed in soft blankets. Angela \\nsat in a chair beside him, staring at his face intently. “How do you feel?” she \\nasked.\\nDisoriented and \\nconfused, he let his eyes roam over the small room. “I . . . I don’t know,” he \\nsaid, his mouth dry and sore.\\n“Then don’t \\nmove. You should conserve your strength,” said Angela, running a hand through \\nher curly hair. Eragon saw that she still wore her flanged armor. Why was that? \\nA fit of coughing made him dizzy, lightheaded, and ache all over. His feverish \\nlimbs felt heavy. Angela lifted a gilt horn from the floor and held it to his \\nlips. “Here, drink.”\\nCool mead ran \\ndown his throat, refreshing him. Warmth bloomed in his stomach and rose to his \\ncheeks. He coughed again, which worsened his throbbing head. How did I get \\nhere? There was a battle . . . we were losing . . . then Durza and . . .“Saphira!” \\nhe exclaimed, sitting upright. He sagged back as his head swam and clenched his \\neyes, feeling sick. “What about Saphira? Is she all right? The Urgals were \\nwinning . . . she was falling. And Arya!”\\n“They lived,” \\nassured Angela, “and have been waiting for you to wake. Do you wish to see \\nthem?” He nodded feebly. Angela got up and threw open the door. Arya and \\nMurtagh filed inside. Saphira snaked her head into the room after them, her \\nbody too big to fit through the doorway. Her chest vibrated as she hummed \\ndeeply, eyes sparkling.\\nSmiling, Eragon \\ntouched her thoughts with relief and gratitude.It is good to see you well, \\nlittle one, she said tenderly.\\nAnd you too, but \\nhow—?\\n\\nThe others want \\nto explain it, so I will let them. \\nYou breathed \\nfire!I saw you!\\n\\nYes,she said with \\npride.\\nHe smiled \\nweakly, still confused, then looked at Arya and Murtagh. Both of them were \\nbandaged: Arya on her arm, Murtagh around his head. Murtagh grinned widely. \\n“About time you were up. We’ve been sitting in the hall for hours.”\\n“What . . . what \\nhappened?” asked Eragon.\\nArya looked sad. \\nBut Murtagh crowed, “We won! It was incredible! When the Shade’s spirits—if \\nthat’s what they were—flew across Farthen Dûr, the Urgals ceased fighting to \\nwatch them go. It was as though they were released from a spell then, because \\ntheir clans suddenly turned and attacked each other. Their entire army \\ndisintegrated within minutes. We routed them after that!”\\n“They’re all \\ndead?” asked Eragon.\\nMurtagh shook \\nhis head. “No, many of them escaped into the tunnels. The Varden and dwarves \\nare busy ferreting them out right now, but it’s going to take a while. I was \\nhelping until an Urgal banged me on the head and I was sent back here.”\\n“They aren’t \\ngoing to lock you up again?”\\nHis face grew \\nsober. “No one really cares about that right now. A lot of Varden and dwarves \\nwere killed; the survivors are busy trying to recover from the battle. But at \\nleast you have cause to be happy. You’re a hero! Everyone’s talking about how \\nyou killed Durza. If it hadn’t been for you, we would have lost.”\\nEragon was \\ntroubled by his words but pushed them away for later consideration. “Where were \\nthe Twins? They weren’t where they were supposed to be—I couldn’t contact them. \\nI needed their help.”\\nMurtagh \\nshrugged. “I was told they bravely fought off a group of Urgals that broke into \\nTronjheim somewhere else. They were probably too busy to talk with you.”\\nThat seemed \\nwrong for some reason, but Eragon could not decide why. He turned to Arya. Her \\nlarge bright eyes had been fixed upon him the entire time. “How come you didn’t \\ncrash? You and Saphira were . . .” His voice trailed off.\\nShe said slowly, \\n“When you warned Saphira of Durza, I was still trying to remove her damaged \\narmor. By the time it was off, it was too late to slide down Vol Turin—you \\nwould have been captured before I reached the bottom. Besides, Durza would have \\nkilled you before letting me rescue you.” Regret entered her voice, “So I did \\nthe one thing I could to distract him: I broke the star sapphire.”\\nAnd I carried \\nher down,added \\nSaphira.\\nEragon struggled \\nto understand as another bout of lightheadedness made him close his eyes. “But \\nwhy didn’t any of the pieces hit you or me?”\\n“I didn’t allow \\nthem to. When we were almost to the floor, I held them motionless in the air, \\nthen slowly lowered them to the floor—else they would have shattered into a \\nthousand pieces and killed you,” stated Arya simply. Her words betrayed the \\npower within her.\\nAngela added \\nsourly, “Yes, and it almost killed you as well. It’s taken all of my skill to \\nkeep the two of you alive.”\\nA twinge of \\nunease shot through Eragon, matching the intensity of his throbbing head.My \\nback . . . But he felt no bandages there. “How long have I been here?” he \\nasked with trepidation.\\n“Only a day and \\na half,” answered Angela. “You’re lucky I was around, otherwise it would’ve \\ntaken you weeks to heal—if you had even lived.” Alarmed, Eragon pushed the \\nblankets off his torso and twisted around to feel his back. Angela caught his \\nwrist with her small hand, worry reflected in her eyes. “Eragon . . . you have \\nto understand, my power is not like yours or Arya’s. It depends on the use of \\nherbs and potions. There are limits to what I can do, especially with such a \\nlarge—”\\nHe yanked his \\nhand out of her grip and reached back, fingers groping. The skin on his back \\nwas smooth and warm, flawless. Hard muscles flexed under his fingertips as he \\nmoved. He slid his hand toward the base of his neck and unexpectedly felt a \\nhard bump about a half-inch wide. He followed it down his back with growing \\nhorror. Durza’s blow had left him with a huge, ropy scar, stretching from his \\nright shoulder to the opposite hip.\\nPity showed on \\nArya’s face as she murmured, “You have paid a terrible price for your deed, \\nEragon Shadeslayer.”\\nMurtagh laughed \\nharshly. “Yes. Now you’re just like me.”\\nDismay filled \\nEragon, and he closed his eyes. He was disfigured. Then he remembered something \\nfrom when he was unconscious . . . a figure in white who had helped him. A \\ncripple who was whole—Togira Ikonoka. He had said,Think of what you have \\ndone and rejoice, for you have rid the land of a great evil. You have wrought a \\ndeed no one else could. Many are in your debt. . . .\\nCome to me \\nEragon, for I have answers to all you ask. \\nA measure of \\npeace and satisfaction consoled Eragon.\\nI will come. \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 47': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nEND OFBOOKONE\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 48': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nTHE STORY WILL CONTINUE IN\\nEldest, \\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 49': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nBOOKTWO OFINHERITANCE\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 50': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nP RONUNCIATION\\n\\nAjihad—AH-zhi-hod\\nAlagaësia—al-uh-GAY-zee-uh\\nArya—AR-ee-uh\\nCarvahall—CAR-vuh-hall\\nDras-Leona—DRAHS-lee-OH-nuh\\nDu \\nWeldenvarden—doo WELL-den-VAR-den\\nEragon—EHR-uh-gahn\\nFarthen \\nDûr—FAR-then DURE (durerhymes withlure )\\nGalbatorix—gal-buh-TOR-icks\\nGil’ead—GILL-ee-id\\nJeod—JODE \\n(rhymes withload )\\nMurtagh—MUR-tag \\n(murrhymes withpurr )\\nRa’zac—RAA-zack\\nSaphira—suh-FEAR-uh\\nShruikan—SHREW-kin\\nTeirm—TEERM\\nTronjheim—TRONJ-heem\\nVrael—VRAIL\\nYazuac—YA-zoo-ack\\nZar’roc—ZAR-rock\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 51': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n\\nIcreatedEragon, \\nbut its success is the result of the enthusiastic efforts of friends, family, \\nfans, librarians, teachers, students, school administrators, distributors, \\nbooksellers, and many more. I wish I could mention by name all the people who \\nhave helped, but the list is very, very long. You know who you are, and I thank \\nyou!\\nEragonwas first \\npublished in early 2002 by my parents’ publishing company, Paolini \\nInternational LLC. They had already released three books, so it was only \\nnatural to do the same withEragon . We knewEragon would appeal to \\na wide range of readers; our challenge was to spread the word about it.\\nDuring 2002 and \\nthe beginning of 2003, I traveled throughout the United States doing over 130 \\nbook signings and presentations in schools, bookstores, and libraries. My \\nmother and I arranged all the events. At first I had only one or two \\nappearances per month, but as we became more efficient at scheduling, our \\nhomemade book tour expanded to the point where I was on the road almost \\ncontinuously.\\nI met thousands \\nof wonderful people, many of whom became loyal fans and friends. One of those \\nfans is Michelle Frey, now my editor at Knopf Books for Young Readers, who \\napproached me with an offer to acquireEragon . Needless to say, I was \\ndelighted that Knopf was interested in my book.\\nThus, there are \\ntwo groups of people who deserve thanks. The first assisted with the production \\nof the Paolini International LLC edition ofEragon, while the second is \\nresponsible for the Knopf edition.\\nHere are the \\nbrave souls who helped bringEragon into existence:\\n\\xa0\\nThe original \\ngang: my mother for her thoughtful red pen and wonderful help with commas, \\ncolons, semicolons, and other assorted beasties; my father for his smashing \\nediting job, all the time he spent hammering my vague, wayward thoughts into \\nline, formatting the book and designing the cover, and listening to so many \\npresentations; Grandma Shirley for helping me create a satisfactory beginning \\nand ending; my sister for her plot advice, her good humor at being portrayed as \\nan herbalist inEragon, and her long hours Photoshopping Saphira’s eye on \\nthe cover; Kathy Tyers for giving me the means to do a brutal—and \\nmuch-needed—rewrite of the first three chapters; John Taliaferro for his advice \\nand wonderful review; a fan named Tornado—Eugene Walker—who caught a number of \\ncopyediting errors; and Donna Overall for her love of the story, editing and \\nformatting advice, and keen eye for all things concerning ellipses, em dashes, \\nwidows, orphans, kerning, and run-on sentences. If there’s a real-life Dragon \\nRider, she’s one—selflessly coming to the rescue of writers lost in the Swamp \\nof Commas. And I thank my family for supporting me wholeheartedly . . . and for \\nreading this saga more times than any sane person should have to.\\n\\xa0\\nThe new gang: Michelle \\nFrey, who not only loved the story enough to take a chance on an epic fantasy \\nwritten by a teenager but also managed to streamlineEragon ’s pacing \\nthrough her insightful editing; my agent, Simon Lipskar, who helped find the \\nbest home forEragon; Chip Gibson and Beverly Horowitz for the wonderful \\noffer; Lawrence Levy for his good humor and legal advice; Judith Haut, \\npublicity whiz of the first degree; Daisy Kline for the awe-inspiring marketing \\ncampaign; Isabel Warren-Lynch, who designed the lovely book jacket, interior, \\nand map; John Jude Palencar, who painted the jacket art (I actually named \\nPalancar Valley for him long before he ever worked onEragon ); Artie \\nBennett, the doyen of copyediting and the only man alive who understood the \\ndifference betweento scry it andto scry on it; and the entire \\nteam at Knopf who have made this adventure possible.\\n\\xa0\\nLastly, a very \\nspecial thanks to my characters, who bravely face the dangers I force them to \\nconfront, and without whom I wouldn’t have a story.\\n\\xa0\\nMay your swords \\nstay sharp!\\n\\xa0\\nChristopher \\nPaolini\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n 'Chapter 52': '\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nA BOUT THE AUTHOR\\nChristopher \\nPaolini’s abiding love of fantasy and science fiction inspired him to begin \\nwriting his debut novel,Eragon, when he graduated from high school at \\nfifteen. Now nineteen, he lives with his family in Paradise Valley, Montana, \\nwhere he is at work onEldest, the next volume in the Inheritance \\ntrilogy.\\nYou can find out \\nmore about Christopher,Eragon, and Inheritance atwww.alagaesia.com .\\n\\n\\n'}"
